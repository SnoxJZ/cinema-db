Maybe I'm just not in the mood for it.\r\n\r\nWhy is Adebayo so... clownish?

  "content": "## **Peacemaker is a Flawless Masterpiece**\r\n\r\nLet’s be unequivocal: the first two seasons of James Gunn’s *Peacemaker* are not just great television; they are a rare, explosive, and emotionally resonant masterpiece that achieves a perfect 10/10. In a landscape crowded with superhero media, this series is a glorious, blood-soaked, and unexpectedly heartfelt unicorn. It takes a D-list DC villain—a man whose entire personality is built on a ridiculous helmet and a questionable moral compass—and crafts one of the most compelling character arcs in modern fiction.\r\n\r\n### The Gunn-verse Unchained\r\n\r\nIf *The Suicide Squad* (2021) let James Gunn off his leash, *Peacemaker* gives him the keys to the entire kingdom. The show is a pure, unfiltered distillation of his sensibilities: a perfect alchemy of crass humour, hyper-violent action, a killer hair-metal soundtrack, and a shocking, genuine heart. The premise is deceptively simple: after the events of *The Suicide Squad*, Christopher Smith / Peacemaker (John Cena) is forced to work with a ragtag, deeply dysfunctional black-ops team on \"Project Butterfly\"—a mission to stop an alien parasite invasion. The genius lies in the execution.\r\n\r\n### Season 1: The Perfect Blueprint\r\n\r\nThe first season is a flawless eight-episode arc. It masterfully balances:\r\n\r\n*   **Hilarious, Unapologetic Humour:** The dialogue is relentlessly witty, profane, and absurd. From the deeply philosophical debates about music to the sheer horror of \"eating a whole bowl of dicks,\" the show is laugh-out-loud funny from start to finish.\r\n*   **Shockingly Deep Character Work:** We expect jokes and action, but we get a profound exploration of toxic masculinity, parental abuse, and the struggle for redemption. Peacemaker starts as a pathetic, brainwashed bigot and evolves into a man painfully learning to feel empathy. John Cena delivers a performance that should have garnered every award available, blending physical comedy with stunning vulnerability.\r\n*   **A Perfectly Balanced Ensemble Cast:** Every character is iconic. Danielle Brooks as Leota Adebayo, the moral compass with a secret; Jennifer Holland's stoic yet damaged Emilia Harcourt; Steve Agee's kind-hearted John Economos; and the scene-stealing, universe-altering performance by Freddie Stroma as Vigilante, the hilariously psychotic and fiercely loyal best friend. Their chemistry is electric.\r\n*   **The Greatest Opening Credits Ever Put to Film:** The solemn, perfectly choreographed dance sequence to Wig Wam’s \"Do Ya Wanna Taste It\" is un-skippable. It sets the tone immediately: this show doesn't take itself seriously, but it is dead-serious about its characters.\r\n\r\n### Season 2: The Triumphant, Meta Evolution\r\n\r\nSomehow, Season 2 elevates the formula. Picking up after the events of the *Blue Beetle* post-credit scene, it deals with the fallout of the DCU reboot in the most brilliant, meta-textual way possible. The \"butterfly\" infection is gone, but a new, more insidious threat emerges: Peacemaker's own irrelevance and his team's fractured dynamic in a universe that has seemingly forgotten them.\r\n\r\n*   **Deepened Relationships:** The bonds forged in Season 1 are tested, broken, and reforged with even greater strength. The exploration of friendship, forgiveness, and found family hits even harder.\r\n*   **Vigilante's Ascension:** Freddie Stroma cements his status as one of the greatest comedic characters in TV history, with an arc that is both ridiculously funny and strangely touching.\r\n*   **Narrative Ambition:** By making the central conflict internal and existential, Gunn avoids the \"bigger villain\" trap. The season is a masterclass in character-driven storytelling, proving that the biggest battles are often the ones we fight with our own demons and our past.\r\n\r\n### The Verdict: A Perfect 10/10\r\n\r\n*Peacemaker* is television firing on all cylinders. It is a show that makes you cry from laughter one moment and from a raw, emotional gut-punch the next. It features career-best performances, a flawless soundtrack, thrilling action, and, at its core, a powerful message about choosing to be better, no matter how fucked up your start in life was.\r\n\r\nIt is the gold standard for what a comic book adaptation can be: bold, personal, hilarious, and profoundly human. It is, in a word, perfect.\r\n\r\n... I only hope there is a season 3!!!",

  "content": "One of the great TV series of all time. To achieve this it has to be original so you don't think the scripts have been written by a computer programming that cuts and pastes the \"best\" bits out of other series or just rehashes something that's already been done but long enough ago that the key audience won't have seen the original. So it's original by creating a lead character that's a serial killer but he has to be a hero as well or it's going to be a villain in a slasher series. So he's given the **code** which only allows him to kill the really bad guys. He's very intelligent but how's he going to get the information he needs so he can be sure he's targeting a real bad guy who deserves what's coming to him or her? So even though he smart enough to become a top doctor he chooses to become a forensic scientist and work for the police. Access to police records and forensic evidence that allows him to make a correct choice for his next victim. With the excellent scripts you have the basis for a hit series. When you add a set of very good actors who are asked to play superb characters it all falls into place. Intricate plots and twists and turns in every story keeps your attention akin to a book that's a great page turner. It's always a good idea to quit when you're on top but I was disappointed that Dexter had to end but at least it didn't suffer a slow and lingering death with main characters bailing as the end becomes clearer and clearer. If you check the discussions you'll see a number of people who watched all seasons of the show in a binge approach of viewing all episodes one after the other. To give people the incentive to do that it's got to be an exceptional TV show.",

I was actually getting into it.\r\n\r\nAnd then 2020 happened and it took a HARD left wing turn  It fell apart.  It took a bit of an ACAB stance, which is awkward in a police drama.  It started to do the who leftist lecture thing.  The \"inappropriate\" relationships according to the left broke up.  It became crap.  So much so that I started calling it \"The Wokie.\"\r\n\r\nBut then it slowly started to veer back to an actual cop show again. The characters that I was getting into when it started started to return to the same characters and not just the same woke stereo-types.  Personalities came back to them, actual individual personalities, which seems to be one of the biggest problems with leftist media, they can't give people personalities, they just give them gender and races and sexualities and mistake that for actual character.\r\n\r\nIn other words, it redeemed itself.  It started being a police drama again.  It started to be an ensemble cast of compelling characters again.  It even got rid of the worst woke characters they injected and brought the whole thing back to the original cast. The politics vanished, and it became about entertainment again.\r\n\r\nIt's a GREAT example of how to make fix a show after a heavy injection of politics.",

Even for a comedy, it stretches credulity at times and lacks an intelligent wit and charm, that would have rendered it, more appealing. \r\n\r\nIn summary, Stallone's star power will probably draw people in but will viewers keep watching?

You may even say it's been institutionalized since the community's inception. \r\n\r\nPeople can read into this however they want; what really matters is if it works or not.  Given that the kids are literally werewolves, sirens, medusas and other cryptid creatures of lore, it is my opinion if you feel this dynamic is only in place to make you feel fragile, than you need  to (in the words of my grandfather) 'get a tougher skin'.  Honestly, it's a TV show, are you that wounded?\r\n\r\nAs these kids are in fact literally and physically outcasts to our society, their struggles being so and trying to fit in work in this story.  I believe because Wednesday isn't physically a cryptid people expected something else.  She's always been, along with her whole family obviously not normal and thus outcasts like the rest. \r\n\r\nWhat I really enjoyed about this is the dynamic between Jenna and the un-talking member of the Adams' family, Thing (physically played by **Victor Dorobantu**).  The actor wears a green suite except for his hand and contorts his way through every scene. The result is a way more realistic human hand running around than any CGI could have ever done. I also love the duplicity between Wednesday and her trying-to-be / would-be warewolf roommate, Endid (joyfully played by **Emma Myers**).  There are honestly quite a few very likeable supporting characters that make the gloom and doom (that I love) from the main character and balance it into something even more plateable. \r\n\r\nIf your nostalgic for the kooky family, the show has plenty of fan service that isn't too blatant (at least not for everything all the time). You get the finger snaps, you get Christina Ricci (for those 90's kids fans), and you get a pretty accurate Adams Family as compared to the original source material. \r\n\r\nI believe the plots mystery will keep people engaged enough (it's no Knives Out or Glass Onion), but combine that with the strength of the characters and you get a really great TV show worth re-watching;  which is personally one of the highest praise I can put on a TV series.  Highly recommended!",

It is very daring that any time anybody can just die (I learned not to be attached and have accepted that they will all die so I won't be devastated hehe).

They ran out of book-material, and it shows. Everything starts focusing on the big set-pieces, characters become extremely bland and predictable.

Of course they want you to think that they will still kill some of the main characters, but they're just teasing.\r\n\r\nThe last few seasons I've only been watching to see what the conclusion to this story is, but I cringe and writhe during every episode I watch.

I watched all 8 seasons, so I'm quite qualified to review it: It wasn't bad TV show. Actually it was quite good with interesting characters, but it wasn't as good as I was told and I personally don't agree on that statement that it's better than Vikings. Most interesting parts where around queen Daenerys. This TV show gets tense after season 7, however things don't go like we wanted and ending is awfully bad. Basically, this TV show is ruined by stupidly bad ending which leaves you quite upset. In short, GOT is good TV show (not great), ruined by bad ending.",

The settings and characters are realistic, and the Machiavellian plot lines seems to make sense to me for a while.  As the series went on, however, my interest began to flag a bit. Some of the characters that seemed complex at the outset, devolved into predictable two-dimensional stereotypes. And my stars, the number of rapes going on. I recognize that in such society rape was probably commonplace, but it was likely so in Ancient Rome also, and yet the great series Rome found other ways to titillate than the one-trick pony of forced entry.\r\n\r\nSo I confess I didn’t make it to the end of the show, but from what I hear, even big fans of the show were let down by how it all wound down.",

  "content": "**The Greatest Story Ever Filmed**\r\n\r\nIt's nothing new that HBO always have the most ambitious projects around, but from 2011 to 2019 they gradually built what I consider the epitome of quality television, and made history. The highly talented show-runners David Benioff and Dan Weiss took the unadaptable giant books by George R. R. Martin and transformed them into this beautifully constructed show, that something of it's kind was never done before. There are so many layers to this story, so many characters and story arcs intertwining with each other that it seems impossible to grasp one man came up with it all.\r\n\r\nThe story Martin created is probably one of the better and most detailed and well-crafted stories of all times, and David and Dan's transformation of the story to the TV medium was beautifully handled. There aren't that many shows when you sit and watch an episode and savor every single scene, if it's the content itself or the many small details that were precisely designed for every frame you watch. It takes a little time to get into the show in the beginning, just because it's very different from what we are generally used to. It's one of those shows that from the very first episode until the last it's just one big story so you just need patience to get used to everything that's going on in there, and after that enjoyment is guaranteed. Above all, the thing the show benefited perhaps the most of is the fact that ever since the day they started writing the first script- the complete story from start to finish was compiled in George's head. Not all the details and specifics of course, but the outline and major plot points were invented years ago when he started working on this huge book series, therefore the production knew exactly where to start, where the story is heading and where it ends, which gave consistency to the story from episode 1 to 73, without getting lost in the way with loose threads.\r\n\r\nThe show gets plenty of criticism for its deviations from the source material season 5 and onwards, but if you just think for a second how enormous this story is it's pretty easy to realize a lot needed to be altered to fit the TV medium, and David and Dan managed to do so while preserving the original essence of Martin's creation, keep the story well constructed and coherent and keep dozens of millions of viewers satisfied, and not only a handful of hard core followers that wanted it to be a page- to-page adaption of the novels. While I enjoyed all the books and didn't agree with a few of the changes they made for the show as well I can see why a lot had to be cut, things don't work the same in books as in television. Considering they knew the ending from the start and the huge amount of details you have to alter just from omitting one storyline if you want to reach the same final goal as the books, I believe it was overall for the best and they knew what they were doing, the story didn't collapse under their hands- at least as far as I'm concerned.\r\n\r\nOne of the most prominent aspects of this show in my opinion is Ramin Djawadi's masterful score which must be one of the most brilliantly unique works ever for a series (whether it's a series of movies or TV series) not only because of the compositions themselves, which are exceptionally beautiful, but also for how the music evolves throughout the seasons and builds the world of the show hand to hand with the writing, the characters and the setting as the story progresses. Also, the way each motif of the music identifies with a certain aspect of the story, though mostly noticeable in later seasons, tells a complete story on its own. Never seen anything like it.\r\n\r\nAll these wordy descriptions couldn't however describe the experience of watching this show live as it aired. The thrill, the off-season anticipation and continuous speculations, the satisfaction of watching a new amazing episode after waiting for so long, the 8-years-long water-cooler talks and the overall influence GoT had on pop culture in the time it was on TV- I'm sure many of us will always remember how it felt, and I'm not sure if we'll get to experience something like that anytime soon. I already watched each season several times, probably more than any other show or movie, and I never get tired of any of it, if it's the well constructed dialogues or blood pumping action sequences. I definitely see myself still constantly revisiting seasons every once in a while from now until further notice.\r\n\r\nI think the success of the show speaks for itself- the countless awards, high acclaim from casual viewers and critics alike, the major fan following, it's influences on the television landscape and on culture in general- it's a winner in all fronts. In my personal opinion it's the greatest television series ever made, but generally speaking I think it's safe to say this show is for the ages and I think it will be remembered for a long time as one of the greatest cinematic works ever produced. Even almost 2 years after the show ended, it still remains one of the most popular and in-demand shows in the world, which I find pretty amazing. I just hope the uproar on social media will calm down eventually so we can once again all enjoy this show together. People tend to use this word too cheaply these days, but I wouldn't say Game of Thrones is anything short of a masterpiece.",

  "content": "# **15 Years of Saving People, Hunting Things: The Supernatural Phenomenon**\r\n\r\n## **Why Supernatural Endured for 15 Seasons**\r\n\r\nFifteen seasons. Over 300 episodes. That’s not just a show—it’s a legacy. *Supernatural* wasn’t just about monster hunts or witty one-liners (though it had plenty of those). It was about two brothers, their iconic Chevy Impala, and the kind of storytelling that digs deep, pulls at your heart, and keeps you hooked until the very end.\r\n\r\nAt its core, *Supernatural* was a masterclass in blending horror, humor, and raw emotion. It’s no surprise the *SPN Family*remains as passionate as ever—because this show wasn’t just something you watched, it was something you *felt*. Whether the Winchester brothers were fighting demons or angels, it was always about their bond. That’s the heartbeat of *Supernatural*.\r\n\r\nSo what made *Supernatural* stand out? From the unforgettable chemistry between Sam and Dean to the perfect mix of epic mythology and iconic episodes, *Supernatural* earned its place as one of TV’s greatest—and even after 15 seasons, we still can’t stop talking about it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Sam and Dean: The Unbreakable Bond at Supernatural’s Core**\r\n\r\nAt the center of *Supernatural* is one undeniable truth: this show is, and always has been, about Sam and Dean Winchester. Sure, they’ve battled everything from shape-shifters to archangels, but the real fight has always been for each other. Their bond goes beyond just being brothers—it’s about loyalty, sacrifice, and that deep, unspoken connection that keeps them pushing forward no matter the cost.\r\n\r\nSam and Dean aren’t just characters—they’ve become a blueprint for what makes a dynamic duo truly great. Dean, with his tough-as-nails exterior and unshakeable devotion, and Sam, the thoughtful, conflicted younger brother trying to balance family duty with his own desires, are the emotional heartbeat of the series. Together, they aren’t just fighting monsters—they’re fighting fate, destiny, and everything in between.\r\n\r\nWhat makes their relationship so powerful is the constant tug-of-war between their deep love for one another and the weight of the sacrifices they make. Each of them has literally gone to Hell and back for the other, and these moments of sacrifice hit hard because they feel real. It’s the kind of relationship that sticks with you long after the credits roll. No matter how intense the monster hunts get, it’s always the quieter, more intimate moments between Sam and Dean that resonate the most.\r\n\r\nThe Winchester brothers are the reason we keep coming back. Their chemistry is electric, their struggles are relatable, and their bond is unbreakable. At the end of the day, *Supernatural* isn’t just about saving the world—it’s about saving each other, and that’s what makes it special.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **A Perfect Blend: Horror, Comedy, Drama, and Heart**\r\n\r\n*Supernatural* is a masterclass in genre-blending. This show doesn’t just play in one sandbox—it takes over the entire playground. Horror? Check. Comedy? Absolutely. Drama? You bet. And somehow, it manages to weave all of these elements together without missing a beat.\r\n\r\nLet’s start with the horror. We’re talking everything from classic ghost hunts to full-on battles with demons and angels. The scares are real, but *Supernatural* never leans too hard into the gloom. Just when you’re clutching your blanket, Dean drops a snarky one-liner or Castiel gives you that wonderfully deadpan confusion, and suddenly you’re laughing. It’s this perfect pivot between tension and humor that keeps the show fresh and—dare I say it—fun.\r\n\r\nBut here’s where *Supernatural* really nails it: the heart. Beneath all the monster slaying and apocalyptic drama, this is a show about family and sacrifice. Every episode, no matter how wild the plot gets, is anchored by Sam and Dean’s relationship. They’ll literally go to Hell (and back) for each other, and the emotional depth that brings is what turns a good show into a great one.\r\n\r\nThe genius of *Supernatural* is that it never lets one genre overpower the others. It’s as comfortable delivering gut-punching emotional moments as it is making you jump out of your seat or burst out laughing. And that balance? That’s why fans keep coming back—because with *Supernatural*, you’re getting the best of every world.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **The *Supernatural* Mythology: From Urban Legends to Apocalyptic Battles**\r\n\r\nIf you thought *Supernatural* was just about hunting ghosts and taking down demons, think again. This show goes all-in when it comes to mythology—pulling from urban legends, religious lore, and just about every spooky story you’ve ever heard whispered around a campfire. It’s like a folklore buffet, and *Supernatural* serves it up hot.\r\n\r\nThe early seasons keep it tight with classic monster-of-the-week vibes: wendigos, shapeshifters, cursed mirrors—you name it, Sam and Dean have faced it. But here’s where the show really flexes its creative muscles. As it grows, so does the mythology, until we’re no longer just talking about salt lines and silver bullets. Suddenly, we’re dealing with fallen angels, biblical prophecies, and—oh yeah—Lucifer himself. This isn’t your average horror show; this is epic, universe-spanning storytelling.\r\n\r\n*Supernatural* does what few other shows manage—it constantly raises the stakes without collapsing under the weight of its own lore. It takes bold swings. One season, you’re dealing with a local haunting, the next, you’re questioning the very nature of free will and destiny as Sam and Dean go toe-to-toe with God. Yeah, it gets that big. But no matter how grand the mythology gets, the story never forgets where it started—on the road, in that Impala, with two brothers just trying to survive.\r\n\r\nThe genius lies in the balance. The show dances between grounded urban legends and sweeping, cosmic battles, and somehow, it all works. The lore isn’t just background noise either—it’s integral to the emotional weight of the series. Every demon exorcised, every angelic encounter adds layers to Sam and Dean’s journey, and by the end, you’re not just watching a TV show—you’re knee-deep in a modern myth.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Character Growth and Evolution: From Hunters to Heroes**\r\n\r\nLet’s get one thing straight—*Supernatural* wouldn’t be the powerhouse it is without its incredible character work. Sure, the monsters, demons, and angels are fun, but it’s the characters that keep us coming back. Over 15 seasons, these aren’t just hunters—they’re heroes, villains, and everything in between, evolving in ways that make them feel real and raw.\r\n\r\nWe’ve got Sam and Dean, obviously, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. *Supernatural* thrives because it fills its world with characters who are as complex as they are iconic, whether they’re wielding a blade, throwing a sarcastic quip, or breaking your heart in ways you didn’t see coming.\r\n\r\n### **The Winchester Brothers: Heart of the Show**\r\n\r\nLet’s start where it all began: Sam and Dean. These two aren’t just brothers—they’re the emotional core of the entire series. From episode one, it’s clear their bond is what makes this show different. Sure, they fight demons and battle the apocalypse on a regular basis, but at the end of the day, *Supernatural* is a story about family.\r\n\r\nDean, the hardened, tough-love protector, grows from a cocky hunter into a deeply vulnerable character, grappling with self-worth and purpose. His bravado might be the surface, but underneath is a man who’d throw himself into Hell (literally) for the people he loves. Dean is a walking paradox: a man who craves love but feels he doesn’t deserve it. By the end, his arc feels like an emotional marathon—you’ve seen him win, lose, and keep fighting even when all hope is gone.\r\n\r\nAnd then there’s Sam. The younger Winchester brother starts out wanting nothing to do with the hunter life, but as the series progresses, we watch him become the moral compass, even when that means making brutal sacrifices. He wrestles with dark powers, addiction, and self-doubt, but somehow, Sam always finds his way back to the fight. His journey from idealistic college kid to seasoned hero with a complicated past makes him one of the most dynamic characters on TV.\r\n\r\n### **Bobby Singer: The Reluctant Mentor Turned Father Figure**\r\n\r\nBobby Singer didn’t just help Sam and Dean fight monsters—he taught them how to survive in a world where evil was as constant as the rising sun. From the moment Bobby entered their lives, he wasn’t just another hunter in the background; he became the mentor they needed after losing their father. With his encyclopedic knowledge of the supernatural and his no-nonsense approach to hunting, Bobby became the man the brothers could turn to when things got rough, a guiding voice when John Winchester’s strict code of survival wasn’t enough.\r\n\r\nWhat made Bobby stand out was that he wasn’t a stereotypical mentor. He was gruff, stubborn, and unapologetically real. But beneath that tough exterior, Bobby had a heart of gold—and a deep, almost paternal love for Sam and Dean. He didn’t just teach them how to fight; he taught them how to think. Bobby wasn’t afraid to call the boys out on their mistakes, pushing them to be better hunters, better brothers, and better men.\r\n\r\nAnd let’s not forget his intellectual prowess. Bobby was the go-to source for lore, rituals, and all things supernatural. When Sam and Dean were stumped, Bobby had the answers, usually found buried in one of his many old, dusty books. His combination of intellect and heart made him indispensable to the Winchester’s journey.\r\n\r\nMore than anything, Bobby’s presence grounded Sam and Dean. He was their anchor, the one person who wasn’t afraid to show them tough love while also being the emotional support they so desperately needed. He wasn’t just a hunter or a friend—he was family, shaping the brothers into the heroes they would ultimately become\r\n\r\n### **Castiel: The Angel Who Fell (In More Ways Than One)**\r\n\r\nNow, let’s talk about *Castiel*, the angel who became so much more than just a celestial being. Castiel starts out as a soldier of Heaven, but his journey quickly takes him down a more human path. He learns about loyalty, sacrifice, and love—not from the angels above, but from Sam and Dean.\r\n\r\nCastiel’s evolution is one of the most emotionally satisfying parts of the series. His deadpan humor and awkward attempts to understand human behavior give the show some of its best comedic moments, but it’s his growing humanity that really tugs at the heartstrings. He transforms from a rigid, obedient angel to a fiercely loyal friend, even when it means defying Heaven’s orders. By the end, Castiel isn’t just an angel—he’s family. His ultimate sacrifice, fueled by love, is one of the show’s most heartbreaking and powerful moments, cementing his place as a fan favorite.\r\n\r\n### **Crowley: The Demon with a Heart (Maybe)**\r\n\r\nNow, enter *Crowley*, the self-proclaimed “King of Hell” who somehow becomes one of the most beloved characters in the show. Crowley isn’t your typical villain—he’s equal parts sinister and hilarious, wielding sarcasm like a weapon. He dances in the grey area between good and evil, forming uneasy alliances with Sam and Dean that blur the lines of morality. Crowley’s evolution is wild: from ruthless demon to someone who shows flashes of loyalty and, dare I say, compassion. He’s the bad guy you hate to love, but can’t stop rooting for. The man makes deals with souls, but still manages to feel like a necessary part of the Winchester family.\r\n\r\n### **Lucifer: The Devil in the Details**\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of villains—let’s not forget *Lucifer*. You’d expect the Devil to be all fire and brimstone, but *Supernatural*gives us a version of him that’s sharp-tongued, manipulative, and, oddly enough, a little charismatic. He’s the ultimate Big Bad, but Lucifer’s complexity goes deeper than just being evil incarnate. He’s a character who feels betrayed, cast aside by his own father (God), and, as twisted as it sounds, you almost *get* him. Almost. Lucifer is unpredictable in the best way—one minute, he’s terrifying, and the next, he’s delivering one of the funniest lines in the show. That’s the beauty of *Supernatural*—even the most sinister characters have layers.\r\n\r\n### **Rowena: Witch with Ambition**\r\n\r\nLet’s talk about *Rowena*. If you thought Crowley was complicated, his mother takes it to another level. Rowena starts out as a cunning, ruthless witch who’s only out for herself. But over time, she evolves into something much more intriguing—a fiercely independent character who eventually shows depth beyond her manipulative facade. Rowena’s growth from power-hungry villain to someone capable of sacrifice gives us one of the richest character arcs in the series. Plus, her sharp tongue and witty one-liners make every scene she’s in a delight. Rowena is the kind of character who proves that even the baddest of witches can change—if only on her own terms.\r\n\r\n### **Charlie Bradbury: The Nerdy Hero We Needed**\r\n\r\nCharlie Bradbury was the fandom’s heart, the geek girl who jumped into the Winchester world and held her own. A brilliant hacker turned hunter, she brought an infectious energy to the series. Charlie was quirky, brave, and endlessly resourceful. Her relationship with Sam and Dean evolved into something like family—proving that not all bonds in *Supernatural* are forged in blood. Charlie represented the fan in all of us, geeking out over LARPing one minute and slaying monsters the next. Her tragic end hit hard because we saw so much of ourselves in her—a reminder that in *Supernatural*, no one is safe, not even the ones who make us smile the most\r\n\r\n*Supernatural*’s genius lies in its characters—each one layered, each one evolving in unexpected ways. Whether it’s Dean battling inner demons, Sam wrestling with impossible choices, or Crowley and Rowena walking the tightrope between villain and ally, every character brings something vital to the table. It’s the humanity behind these larger-than-life figures that makes *Supernatural* more than just a show about monsters—it’s a show about people, family, and the impossible lengths we’ll go to for the ones we love.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **The Classic Rock Soundtrack and Baby: The Heart and Soul of *Supernatural***\r\n\r\nLet’s get one thing straight—*Supernatural* wouldn’t be *Supernatural* without its [killer classic rock soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7jbyn1EOcBopLl6SXISNYx?si=ZVoIA0FNTd2Q79YWRyXU4A&pi=u-okiyK605QK6L) and the Impala, better known as “Baby.” These aren’t just fun add-ons; they’re core characters in the show’s DNA. Dean’s love for classic rock and his dedication to Baby go beyond fandom quirks—they’re extensions of who he is, and by extension, what the show is all about.\r\n\r\nFirst, the music. You hear the opening chords of Kansas’ “Carry On Wayward Son,” and suddenly, you’re not just watching a show—you’re stepping into an epic, fifteen-season journey. It’s the unofficial anthem of the Winchesters, and it hits with emotional weight every time it plays. But it doesn’t stop there. *Supernatural* treats classic rock like a gospel, with Dean as its faithful preacher. Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Bob Seger—it’s all there. Whether it’s “Back in Black” roaring through an Impala montage or the bittersweet notes of Seger’s “Beautiful Loser” during one of those rare reflective moments, the music has always been the show’s soul.\r\n\r\nAnd let’s not forget “Night Moves.” When Dean and Sam share a rare, carefree moment belting out Bob Seger’s iconic track in the car, it’s not just two brothers passing time—it’s a reminder that even in the middle of hunting monsters and fighting the apocalypse, they’re still human. They still *feel*. These songs aren’t just background noise—they’re emotional markers that tell the story as much as the dialogue does.\r\n\r\nThis soundtrack does more than fill silence—it gives the show its heartbeat. Dean rolling down the highway to “Back in Black” feels like a declaration. This isn’t just a random playlist; it’s a soundtrack with soul. And for the fans who grew up with these songs, it’s a nostalgic goldmine, bringing together the thrill of adventure and the comfort of familiarity in every riff and guitar solo. Whether it’s Rush’s “Working Man” pounding through an action-packed scene or “Renegade” by Styx building up to one of the show’s more tense moments, the music elevates the storytelling every single time.\r\n\r\nNow, let’s talk about Baby—the *other* constant in Sam and Dean’s lives. This 1967 Chevy Impala isn’t just a car; she’s a Winchester in her own right. Baby is as much a part of the show as any character. She’s been through every monster hunt, every road trip, and every heartbreak. Dean’s love for her is more than just the pride of owning a classic car—Baby is home. She’s where the brothers retreat when the world gets too heavy, where they talk out their next move or sit in quiet, reflective moments while the radio hums with classic rock.\r\n\r\nAnd then there’s the legendary episode “Baby,” where we get an entire story told from her perspective. It’s genius because it shows us what we’ve always known—Baby isn’t just a backdrop, she’s *central* to the Winchesters’ lives. Every dent, scratch, and repair tells a story. She’s carried them through battles with demons, angels, and even Death itself, and yet, no matter how bad things get, Baby keeps on rolling.\r\n\r\nThe best moments in *Supernatural* often come when the Impala tears down the road, music blaring, and you realize it’s more than just a scene—it’s the embodiment of freedom. When Bob Seger’s “Beautiful Loser” plays during quieter moments, it adds depth to the boys’ story. These aren’t just two guys saving the world—they’re two guys who’ve lost, who’ve sacrificed, and who still get back in that car and keep driving.\r\n\r\nAnd let’s not forget how integral these two elements—music and Baby—are to the fans. Every time we hear “Carry On Wayward Son” or see the Impala glide through a night-lit highway, it brings us back to the heart of *Supernatural*: family, loyalty, and the idea that no matter how bad things get, you don’t stop fighting. The music and Baby are reminders that the Winchesters always keep moving forward. The music gives the show its pulse, and Baby? She gives it its heart.\r\n\r\nTogether, Baby and the soundtrack represent more than just cool cars and great music—they symbolize the unbreakable bond between the brothers and the freedom of life on the road. Dean’s devotion to Baby is about more than metal and wheels—it’s about roots, history, and the one constant in a life filled with chaos. And the classic rock soundtrack? It’s the spirit of *Supernatural*, carrying us through every battle, every tear, and every victory.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, Baby might just be a car and the music might just be a bunch of rock tracks, but in *Supernatural*, they’re everything. Together, they make the Winchesters’ journey more than just a fight against evil—they make it a road trip you never want to end.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **The Balance Between Monster-of-the-Week, Epic Mythology, and Meta Episodes**\r\n\r\nIf *Supernatural* had stuck to just one formula, it wouldn’t have lasted 15 seasons. What makes this show work so brilliantly is its ability to walk the line between gripping standalone episodes (the infamous “monster-of-the-week” format), sprawling multi-season myth arcs, and bold, fourth-wall-breaking meta episodes that drag you deeper into the *Supernatural* universe with a wink and a smirk. This is a balancing act most shows can’t pull off—but *Supernatural*makes it look effortless.\r\n\r\nThe *monster-of-the-week* episodes are where the show leans into its roots. These are the stories that feel like urban legends brought to life: Wendigos, shapeshifters, Bloody Mary—all the creatures you grew up fearing—*Supernatural*served them up with eerie intensity. These episodes kept the show grounded, reminding us that no matter how high the stakes got, at its heart, it was about two brothers solving mysteries in the dark.\r\n\r\nBut then, *Supernatural* did something even smarter—it built a mythos that stretched far beyond the usual ghost story. As the series unfolded, it cracked open a bigger mythology, introducing demons, angels, Lucifer, and eventually, God Himself. And it wasn’t just expanding the stakes—it was creating an entire universe. That seamless switch from local hauntings to biblical showdowns is what gives the series its epic scale. The transition from “what’s that creepy thing in the dark?” to “oh, we’re fighting the actual apocalypse now” shouldn’t have worked this well. But somehow, it did.\r\n\r\nThen came the secret weapon: *Supernatural*’s ability to laugh at itself. The show broke the fourth wall like no other, delivering *meta* episodes that poked fun at its own genre, fandom, and even its actors. These episodes weren’t just gimmicks—they were masterclasses in self-awareness, using humor to not only keep the audience entertained but also to highlight the show’s versatility. Episodes like “The French Mistake,” where Sam and Dean are tossed into an alternate universe where they’re actors in a TV show called *Supernatural*, are the perfect blend of absurdity and cleverness. You’ve got the Winchesters trying to figure out what the hell is going on, while Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki poke fun at their real lives. It’s a ridiculous concept, but it works—and it’s just one example of how the show seamlessly merged its deep, emotional storytelling with moments of pure comedic genius.\r\n\r\nBut it didn’t stop there. Whether it was “Changing Channels,” which hilariously transported Sam and Dean through various TV show genres (hello, sitcom laugh track), or “Fan Fiction,” which took meta to a whole new level by turning the spotlight on the *Supernatural* fandom, these episodes dared to break the rules of traditional TV. And yet, even while poking fun at itself, the show never lost sight of its core themes: family, destiny, and the ongoing struggle between good and evil.\r\n\r\nThese *meta* episodes gave the show room to breathe between the high-stakes mythology arcs and the creature-hunting adventures, allowing for moments of levity and creativity that kept fans hooked. One week, you’re watching Sam and Dean battle a vengeful spirit, and the next, they’re trapped in a fake version of their own lives or hilariously battling their way through TV parodies. And the best part? It never felt out of place. *Supernatural* had built such a flexible, layered world that even the most outlandish episodes fit into its broader narrative.\r\n\r\nThe show’s humor and willingness to poke fun at its own genre only strengthened its bond with fans. We weren’t just watching two brothers take on the apocalypse; we were in on the joke, laughing along as the writers playfully deconstructed the show’s own tropes. The fourth-wall-breaking episodes added a new dimension to the series, proving that *Supernatural* wasn’t afraid to take risks, mock itself, or fully embrace the weird.\r\n\r\nWhether you’re watching an emotional myth arc about Heaven and Hell, a spooky creature-of-the-week, or a meta episode that leaves you laughing out loud, *Supernatural* mastered the art of keeping its audience on their toes. One moment you’re on the edge of your seat, the next you’re in stitches—but no matter what, you’re invested. That’s the magic of this show: the perfect balance of humor, horror, and heart.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Family and Sacrifice: The Heartbeat of *Supernatural***\r\n\r\n“Saving people, hunting things—the family business.” It’s more than a catchphrase. For the Winchesters, it’s a creed. Right from the first episode, *Supernatural* drives home the fact that the Winchester family isn’t like most others. They don’t sit down for Sunday dinners or swap happy holiday stories. Their legacy is blood-soaked, hard-earned, and filled with impossible choices. For Sam and Dean, family isn’t just about genetics—it’s about loyalty, sacrifice, and the willingness to walk into hell (sometimes literally) to save the people you love.\r\n\r\nBut *Supernatural* doesn’t stop at biological bonds. While the show’s emotional center is Sam and Dean’s unbreakable connection, it constantly reminds us that family is about more than blood. From Bobby Singer to Castiel, Charlie Bradbury to Jodie Mills, the Winchesters build a found family around them, one forged in battle and trust.\r\n\r\nBobby isn’t just the grizzled hunter who helps from the sidelines. He’s the father figure the brothers desperately needed after losing their own. And when Bobby sacrifices everything to protect Sam and Dean, it’s not out of duty—it’s love. His gruff “idjits” is always laced with affection, making his inevitable departure one of the series’ most heartbreaking moments. For Bobby, family meant being willing to give everything, even when there was nothing left to give.\r\n\r\nThen there’s Castiel. The angel who started off as Heaven’s loyal soldier quickly became something far more complex—a brother in arms, a friend, and ultimately, family. Castiel’s arc is one of the most poignant examples of *Supernatural*‘s exploration of loyalty. His decision to fall from grace, to fight alongside the Winchesters instead of against them, represents the power of chosen family. Castiel’s ultimate sacrifice for Dean—driven by love, not duty—solidifies his place as a Winchester, proving that sometimes, the strongest family ties aren’t the ones we’re born with, but the ones we create.\r\n\r\nAnd who could forget the fierce women of *Supernatural*? Charlie Bradbury might not have been born into the hunter life, but she earned her place through loyalty and guts. As a geeky, fearless hacker turned badass hunter, Charlie shows us that family can be chosen. Her bond with the Winchesters ran deep, and her tragic end still stings because she wasn’t just a friend—she was family. Jodie Mills, on the other hand, stepped into the role of protector, becoming a mother figure to a new generation of hunters. She didn’t have to take these lost girls under her wing, but she did because, in *Supernatural*, family is about showing up when no one else will.\r\n\r\nTime and time again, *Supernatural* shows us that family means sacrifice. The Winchesters ask themselves the hard question: how far would you go for the people you love? And the answer is always: further than you think. Whether it’s Dean making deals with demons to save Sam, or Sam risking his life to pull Dean from the brink, their story is one of selflessness—sometimes to a fault.\r\n\r\nAnd that’s where the real beauty of the show lies. It’s not just about hunting monsters or saving the world. It’s about the people you’re willing to stand beside in the fight. It’s about the love, loyalty, and sacrifice that define the Winchester legacy. Because in *Supernatural*, family isn’t just a bond—it’s a battle. And even when the stakes are cosmic, it always comes down to saving people and hunting things, because that’s the family business.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **The Fandom That Kept It Alive: The Power of the SPN Family**\r\n\r\nWhen we talk about *Supernatural*’s unprecedented 15-season run, there’s one undeniable force that carried the show through every twist, turn, and apocalyptic showdown: the *SPN Family*. It’s more than just a fanbase—this community of devoted viewers, creators, and passionate advocates became the backbone of *Supernatural*, driving its success and influencing the way fandoms interact with television today. From launching fan campaigns to attending conventions, the *SPN Family* didn’t just support the show—they helped shape it.\r\n\r\nWhat makes *Supernatural* unique is how it built this loyal, worldwide following, despite starting off as an under-the-radar series on The WB (remember that network?). Back in 2005, *Supernatural* premiered to modest ratings, with no guarantee it would survive past its first season. The show might have flown under the radar of the mainstream critics, but the fans? They saw something special.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t long before the *SPN Family* transformed into a cultural powerhouse, keeping *Supernatural* alive through low ratings, network shifts, and even a writer’s strike. While some shows rely solely on their storylines or cast to stay afloat, *Supernatural* had something extra: a fanbase that wasn’t afraid to fight for it. These weren’t casual viewers tuning in once a week—they were engaged, connected, and fiercely loyal.\r\n\r\nFan conventions were one of the biggest drivers behind this loyalty. Year after year, conventions like *Creation Entertainment’s Salute to Supernatural* became pilgrimage spots for fans to meet their favorite cast members, share their art, theories, and stories, and celebrate their love for the show. For many, these events were more than just photo-ops or autograph sessions—they were community-building hubs. Here, fans bonded over their shared love of all things Winchester, forming friendships and creating memories that transcended the screen.\r\n\r\nBut what truly sets the *SPN Family* apart is its activism. The fans didn’t just watch and engage—they gave back. From charity drives inspired by the cast to campaigns like *Random Acts* (founded by Misha Collins, the actor behind Castiel), the *SPN Family* showed that they were willing to take their love for the show and channel it into positive real-world change. It’s this deeper level of engagement that sets them apart from your average fandom.\r\n\r\nAnd here’s the thing—the *Supernatural* team *knew* how much the fandom mattered. They weren’t just passive observers—they embraced the *SPN Family*, making them a part of the narrative. Episodes like “Fan Fiction” and “The Monster at the End of This Book” celebrated the fans in a way no other series had done before, blending real-life fandom with the fictional world of the Winchesters. In the meta episodes, the show didn’t just break the fourth wall—it leaned into it, acknowledging fan fiction, fan theories, and even shipping (Dean/Cas, anyone?) with a wink and a nod.\r\n\r\nMore than once, the *SPN Family* made the impossible happen. After all, it was fan dedication that helped push *Supernatural* into its 15th season, a feat almost unheard of in genre television. And when the show finally aired its last episode, the fandom didn’t just disappear. The community, built over 15 years of love, continues to thrive through fan projects, conventions, and online spaces dedicated to keeping the *Supernatural* spirit alive.\r\n\r\nIn an age where shows often live and die by network decisions or fluctuating ratings, *Supernatural* proved that the voice of the fans could be louder than any number crunching in a studio boardroom. The *SPN Family* wasn’t just a group of people who liked a show—they were the fuel that kept the engine running, year after year, apocalypse after apocalypse.\r\n\r\nSo, while the Winchesters may have closed the final chapter of their story, the *SPN Family* ensures that the legacy of *Supernatural* lives on. It’s a testament to the power of community, proving that when fans truly care, they can keep a story alive well beyond its final credits.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **The Legacy of *Supernatural***\r\n\r\nWhen the curtains finally closed on *Supernatural* after a monumental 15-season run, it was clear the show had left behind more than just a string of successful episodes. It had built a universe, a community, and a legacy that reshaped how genre TV could be experienced. What started as a story about two brothers hunting monsters morphed into a saga that dived deep into mythology, human emotion, and, most importantly, the concept of family—both by blood and by choice.\r\n\r\nThe show’s impact isn’t just measured by its episode count or ratings—it’s about the lives it touched. For many fans, *Supernatural* became more than just a weekly watch; it was a constant through the ups and downs of their lives. The show’s exploration of loss, sacrifice, and the relentless pursuit of doing what’s right, even when it’s hard, resonated deeply. It gave viewers more than just entertainment—it offered comfort and a sense of belonging.\r\n\r\nAnd let’s not forget the way *Supernatural* evolved the landscape of TV storytelling. It mixed procedural elements with an ongoing mythology in a way that allowed it to flex between epic apocalyptic plots and intimate character-driven moments. It embraced a *meta* sense of humor that blurred the line between fiction and reality, giving fans episodes that felt like inside jokes shared by a family—fitting for a show that always came back to the theme of familial bonds.\r\n\r\nAs for the cast, they weren’t just characters on a screen. Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki, Misha Collins, and the rest became household names, in no small part due to the accessibility and warmth they showed to their fans. It’s rare for a cast to engage so fully with their audience, and that, perhaps, is *Supernatural*’s real magic. The sense of community fostered between the creators, cast, and audience is something most shows can only dream of achieving. It’s why, even after the final episode aired, the *SPN Family* continues to thrive.\r\n\r\nAt its core, *Supernatural* was about more than just hunting monsters or saving the world. It was about connection—the connection between characters, the connection between the show and its audience, and the connections it fostered between fans around the globe. For 15 years, *Supernatural* wasn’t just a show; it was a phenomenon. And in that time, it proved one truth above all else: that family doesn’t end in blood",

  "content": "**15 Years of Saving People, Hunting Things: The Supernatural Phenomenon**\r\n\r\n**Why Supernatural Endured for 15 Seasons**\r\nFifteen seasons. Over 300 episodes. That’s not just a show—it’s a legacy. _Supernatural_ wasn’t just about monster hunts or witty one-liners (though it had plenty of those). It was about two brothers, their iconic Chevy Impala, and the kind of storytelling that digs deep, pulls at your heart, and keeps you hooked until the very end.\r\n\r\nAt its core, _Supernatural_ was a masterclass in blending horror, humor, and raw emotion. It’s no surprise the SPN Family remains as passionate as ever—because this show wasn’t just something you watched, it was something you felt. Whether the Winchester brothers were fighting demons or angels, it was always about their bond. That’s the heartbeat of _Supernatural_.\r\n\r\nSo what made _Supernatural_ stand out? From the unforgettable chemistry between Sam and Dean to the perfect mix of epic mythology and iconic episodes, _Supernatural_ earned its place as one of TV’s greatest—and even after 15 seasons, we still can’t stop talking about it.\r\n\r\n**Sam and Dean: The Unbreakable Bond at Supernatural’s Core**\r\nAt the center of _Supernatural_ is one undeniable truth: this show is, and always has been, about Sam and Dean Winchester. Sure, they’ve battled everything from shape-shifters to archangels, but the real fight has always been for each other. Their bond goes beyond just being brothers—it’s about loyalty, sacrifice, and that deep, unspoken connection that keeps them pushing forward no matter the cost.\r\n\r\nSam and Dean aren’t just characters—they’ve become a blueprint for what makes a dynamic duo truly great. Dean, with his tough-as-nails exterior and unshakeable devotion, and Sam, the thoughtful, conflicted younger brother trying to balance family duty with his own desires, are the emotional heartbeat of the series. Together, they aren’t just fighting monsters—they’re fighting fate, destiny, and everything in between.\r\n\r\nWhat makes their relationship so powerful is the constant tug-of-war between their deep love for one another and the weight of the sacrifices they make. Each of them has literally gone to Hell and back for the other, and these moments of sacrifice hit hard because they feel real. It’s the kind of relationship that sticks with you long after the credits roll. No matter how intense the monster hunts get, it’s always the quieter, more intimate moments between Sam and Dean that resonate the most.\r\n\r\nThe Winchester brothers are the reason we keep coming back. Their chemistry is electric, their struggles are relatable, and their bond is unbreakable. At the end of the day, _Supernatural_ isn’t just about saving the world—it’s about saving each other, and that’s what makes it special.\r\n\r\n**A Perfect Blend: Horror, Comedy, Drama, and Heart**\r\n_Supernatural_ is a masterclass in genre-blending. This show doesn’t just play in one sandbox—it takes over the entire playground. Horror? Check. Comedy? Absolutely. Drama? You bet. And somehow, it manages to weave all of these elements together without missing a beat.\r\n\r\nLet’s start with the horror. We’re talking everything from classic ghost hunts to full-on battles with demons and angels. The scares are real, but _Supernatural_ never leans too hard into the gloom. Just when you’re clutching your blanket, Dean drops a snarky one-liner or Castiel gives you that wonderfully deadpan confusion, and suddenly you’re laughing. It’s this perfect pivot between tension and humor that keeps the show fresh and—dare I say it—fun.\r\n\r\nBut here’s where _Supernatural_ really nails it: the heart. Beneath all the monster slaying and apocalyptic drama, this is a show about family and sacrifice. Every episode, no matter how wild the plot gets, is anchored by Sam and Dean’s relationship. They’ll literally go to Hell (and back) for each other, and the emotional depth that brings is what turns a good show into a great one.\r\n\r\nThe genius of _Supernatural_ is that it never lets one genre overpower the others. It’s as comfortable delivering gut-punching emotional moments as it is making you jump out of your seat or burst out laughing. And that balance? That’s why fans keep coming back—because with _Supernatural_, you’re getting the best of every world.\r\n\r\n**The Supernatural Mythology: From Urban Legends to Apocalyptic Battles**\r\nIf you thought _Supernatural_ was just about hunting ghosts and taking down demons, think again. This show goes all-in when it comes to mythology—pulling from urban legends, religious lore, and just about every spooky story you’ve ever heard whispered around a campfire. It’s like a folklore buffet, and _Supernatural_ serves it up hot.\r\n\r\nThe early seasons keep it tight with classic monster-of-the-week vibes: wendigos, shapeshifters, cursed mirrors—you name it, Sam and Dean have faced it. But here’s where the show really flexes its creative muscles. As it grows, so does the mythology, until we’re no longer just talking about salt lines and silver bullets. Suddenly, we’re dealing with fallen angels, biblical prophecies, and—oh yeah—Lucifer himself. This isn’t your average horror show; this is epic, universe-spanning storytelling.\r\n\r\n_Supernatural_ does what few other shows manage—it constantly raises the stakes without collapsing under the weight of its own lore. It takes bold swings. One season, you’re dealing with a local haunting, the next, you’re questioning the very nature of free will and destiny as Sam and Dean go toe-to-toe with God. Yeah, it gets that big. But no matter how grand the mythology gets, the story never forgets where it started—on the road, in that Impala, with two brothers just trying to survive.\r\n\r\nThe genius lies in the balance. The show dances between grounded urban legends and sweeping, cosmic battles, and somehow, it all works. The lore isn’t just background noise either—it’s integral to the emotional weight of the series. Every demon exorcised, every angelic encounter adds layers to Sam and Dean’s journey, and by the end, you’re not just watching a TV show—you’re knee-deep in a modern myth.\r\n\r\n**Character Growth and Evolution: From Hunters to Heroes**\r\nLet’s get one thing straight—_Supernatural_ wouldn’t be the powerhouse it is without its incredible character work. Sure, the monsters, demons, and angels are fun, but it’s the characters that keep us coming back. Over 15 seasons, these aren’t just hunters—they’re heroes, villains, and everything in between, evolving in ways that make them feel real and raw.\r\n\r\nWe’ve got Sam and Dean, obviously, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. _Supernatural_ thrives because it fills its world with characters who are as complex as they are iconic, whether they’re wielding a blade, throwing a sarcastic quip, or breaking your heart in ways you didn’t see coming.\r\n\r\n**The Winchester Brothers: Heart of the Show**\r\nLet’s start where it all began: Sam and Dean. These two aren’t just brothers—they’re the emotional core of the entire series. From episode one, it’s clear their bond is what makes this show different. Sure, they fight demons and battle the apocalypse on a regular basis, but at the end of the day, Supernatural is a story about family.\r\n\r\nDean, the hardened, tough-love protector, grows from a cocky hunter into a deeply vulnerable character, grappling with self-worth and purpose. His bravado might be the surface, but underneath is a man who’d throw himself into Hell (literally) for the people he loves. Dean is a walking paradox: a man who craves love but feels he doesn’t deserve it. By the end, his arc feels like an emotional marathon—you’ve seen him win, lose, and keep fighting even when all hope is gone.\r\n\r\nAnd then there’s Sam. The younger Winchester brother starts out wanting nothing to do with the hunter life, but as the series progresses, we watch him become the moral compass, even when that means making brutal sacrifices. He wrestles with dark powers, addiction, and self-doubt, but somehow, Sam always finds his way back to the fight. His journey from idealistic college kid to seasoned hero with a complicated past makes him one of the most dynamic characters on TV.\r\n\r\n**Bobby Singer: The Reluctant Mentor Turned Father Figure**\r\nBobby Singer didn’t just help Sam and Dean fight monsters—he taught them how to survive in a world where evil was as constant as the rising sun. From the moment Bobby entered their lives, he wasn’t just another hunter in the background; he became the mentor they needed after losing their father. With his encyclopedic knowledge of the supernatural and his no-nonsense approach to hunting, Bobby became the man the brothers could turn to when things got rough, a guiding voice when John Winchester’s strict code of survival wasn’t enough.\r\n\r\nWhat made Bobby stand out was that he wasn’t a stereotypical mentor. He was gruff, stubborn, and unapologetically real. But beneath that tough exterior, Bobby had a heart of gold—and a deep, almost paternal love for Sam and Dean. He didn’t just teach them how to fight; he taught them how to think. Bobby wasn’t afraid to call the boys out on their mistakes, pushing them to be better hunters, better brothers, and better men.\r\n\r\nAnd let’s not forget his intellectual prowess. Bobby was the go-to source for lore, rituals, and all things supernatural. When Sam and Dean were stumped, Bobby had the answers, usually found buried in one of his many old, dusty books. His combination of intellect and heart made him indispensable to the Winchester’s journey.\r\n\r\nMore than anything, Bobby’s presence grounded Sam and Dean. He was their anchor, the one person who wasn’t afraid to show them tough love while also being the emotional support they so desperately needed. He wasn’t just a hunter or a friend—he was family, shaping the brothers into the heroes they would ultimately become.\r\n\r\n**Castiel: The Angel Who Fell (In More Ways Than One)**\r\nNow, let’s talk about _Castiel_, the angel who became so much more than just a celestial being. Castiel starts out as a soldier of Heaven, but his journey quickly takes him down a more human path. He learns about loyalty, sacrifice, and love—not from the angels above, but from Sam and Dean.\r\n\r\nCastiel’s evolution is one of the most emotionally satisfying parts of the series. His deadpan humor and awkward attempts to understand human behavior give the show some of its best comedic moments, but it’s his growing humanity that really tugs at the heartstrings. He transforms from a rigid, obedient angel to a fiercely loyal friend, even when it means defying Heaven’s orders. By the end, Castiel isn’t just an angel—he’s family. His ultimate sacrifice, fueled by love, is one of the show’s most heartbreaking and powerful moments, cementing his place as a fan favorite.\r\n\r\n**Crowley: The Demon with a Heart (Maybe)**\r\nNow, enter _Crowley_, the self-proclaimed “King of Hell” who somehow becomes one of the most beloved characters in the show. Crowley isn’t your typical villain—he’s equal parts sinister and hilarious, wielding sarcasm like a weapon. He dances in the grey area between good and evil, forming uneasy alliances with Sam and Dean that blur the lines of morality. Crowley’s evolution is wild: from ruthless demon to someone who shows flashes of loyalty and, dare I say, compassion. He’s the bad guy you hate to love, but can’t stop rooting for. The man makes deals with souls, but still manages to feel like a necessary part of the Winchester family.\r\n\r\n**Lucifer: The Devil in the Details**\r\nAnd speaking of villains—let’s not forget _Lucifer_. You’d expect the Devil to be all fire and brimstone, but Supernatural gives us a version of him that’s sharp-tongued, manipulative, and, oddly enough, a little charismatic. He’s the ultimate Big Bad, but Lucifer’s complexity goes deeper than just being evil incarnate. He’s a character who feels betrayed, cast aside by his own father (God), and, as twisted as it sounds, you almost get him. Almost. Lucifer is unpredictable in the best way—one minute, he’s terrifying, and the next, he’s delivering one of the funniest lines in the show. That’s the beauty of _Supernatural_—even the most sinister characters have layers.\r\n\r\n**Rowena: Witch with Ambition**\r\nLet’s talk about _Rowena_. If you thought Crowley was complicated, his mother takes it to another level. Rowena starts out as a cunning, ruthless witch who’s only out for herself. But over time, she evolves into something much more intriguing—a fiercely independent character who eventually shows depth beyond her manipulative facade. Rowena’s growth from power-hungry villain to someone capable of sacrifice gives us one of the richest character arcs in the series. Plus, her sharp tongue and witty one-liners make every scene she’s in a delight. Rowena is the kind of character who proves that even the baddest of witches can change—if only on her own terms.\r\n\r\n**Charlie Bradbury: The Nerdy Hero We Needed**\r\n_Charlie Bradbury_ was the fandom’s heart, the geek girl who jumped into the Winchester world and held her own. A brilliant hacker turned hunter, she brought an infectious energy to the series. Charlie was quirky, brave, and endlessly resourceful. Her relationship with Sam and Dean evolved into something like family—proving that not all bonds in _Supernatural_ are forged in blood. Charlie represented the fan in all of us, geeking out over LARPing one minute and slaying monsters the next. Her tragic end hit hard because we saw so much of ourselves in her—a reminder that in Supernatural, no one is safe, not even the ones who make us smile the most.\r\n\r\n_Supernatural’s_ genius lies in its characters—each one layered, each one evolving in unexpected ways. Whether it’s Dean battling inner demons, Sam wrestling with impossible choices, or Crowley and Rowena walking the tightrope between villain and ally, every character brings something vital to the table. It’s the humanity behind these larger-than-life figures that makes _Supernatural_ more than just a show about monsters—it’s a show about people, family, and the impossible lengths we’ll go to for the ones we love.\r\n\r\n**The Classic Rock Soundtrack and Baby: The Heart and Soul of Supernatural**\r\nLet’s get one thing straight—_Supernatural_ wouldn’t be _Supernatural_ without its killer classic rock soundtrack and the Impala, better known as “Baby.” These aren’t just fun add-ons; they’re core characters in the show’s DNA. Dean’s love for classic rock and his dedication to Baby go beyond fandom quirks—they’re extensions of who he is, and by extension, what the show is all about.\r\n\r\nFirst, the music. You hear the opening chords of Kansas’ “Carry On Wayward Son,” and suddenly, you’re not just watching a show—you’re stepping into an epic, fifteen-season journey. It’s the unofficial anthem of the Winchesters, and it hits with emotional weight every time it plays. But it doesn’t stop there. Supernatural treats classic rock like a gospel, with Dean as its faithful preacher. Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Bob Seger—it’s all there. Whether it’s “Back in Black” roaring through an Impala montage or the bittersweet notes of Seger’s “Beautiful Loser” during one of those rare reflective moments, the music has always been the show’s soul.\r\n\r\nAnd let’s not forget “Night Moves.” When Dean and Sam share a rare, carefree moment belting out Bob Seger’s iconic track in the car, it’s not just two brothers passing time—it’s a reminder that even in the middle of hunting monsters and fighting the apocalypse, they’re still human. They still feel. These songs aren’t just background noise—they’re emotional markers that tell the story as much as the dialogue does.\r\n\r\nThis soundtrack does more than fill silence—it gives the show its heartbeat. Dean rolling down the highway to “Back in Black” feels like a declaration. This isn’t just a random playlist; it’s a soundtrack with soul. And for the fans who grew up with these songs, it’s a nostalgic goldmine, bringing together the thrill of adventure and the comfort of familiarity in every riff and guitar solo. Whether it’s Rush’s “Working Man” pounding through an action-packed scene or “Renegade” by Styx building up to one of the show’s more tense moments, the music elevates the storytelling every single time.\r\n\r\nNow, let’s talk about _Baby_—the other constant in Sam and Dean’s lives. This 1967 Chevy Impala isn’t just a car; she’s a Winchester in her own right. Baby is as much a part of the show as any character. She’s been through every monster hunt, every road trip, and every heartbreak. Dean’s love for her is more than just the pride of owning a classic car—Baby is home. She’s where the brothers retreat when the world gets too heavy, where they talk out their next move or sit in quiet, reflective moments while the radio hums with classic rock.\r\n\r\nAnd then there’s the legendary episode “Baby,” where we get an entire story told from her perspective. It’s genius because it shows us what we’ve always known—Baby isn’t just a backdrop, she’s _central_ to the Winchesters’ lives. Every dent, scratch, and repair tells a story. She’s carried them through battles with demons, angels, and even Death itself, and yet, no matter how bad things get, Baby keeps on rolling.\r\n\r\nThe best moments in _Supernatural_ often come when the Impala tears down the road, music blaring, and you realize it’s more than just a scene—it’s the embodiment of freedom. When Bob Seger’s “Beautiful Loser” plays during quieter moments, it adds depth to the boys’ story. These aren’t just two guys saving the world—they’re two guys who’ve lost, who’ve sacrificed, and who still get back in that car and keep driving.\r\n\r\nAnd let’s not forget how integral these two elements—music and Baby—are to the fans. Every time we hear “Carry On Wayward Son” or see the Impala glide through a night-lit highway, it brings us back to the heart of _Supernatural_: family, loyalty, and the idea that no matter how bad things get, you don’t stop fighting. The music and Baby are reminders that the Winchesters always keep moving forward. The music gives the show its pulse, and Baby? She gives it its heart.\r\n\r\nTogether, Baby and the soundtrack represent more than just cool cars and great music—they symbolize the unbreakable bond between the brothers and the freedom of life on the road. Dean’s devotion to Baby is about more than metal and wheels—it’s about roots, history, and the one constant in a life filled with chaos. And the classic rock soundtrack? It’s the spirit of _Supernatural_, carrying us through every battle, every tear, and every victory.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, Baby might just be a car and the music might just be a bunch of rock tracks, but in _Supernatural_, they’re everything. Together, they make the Winchesters’ journey more than just a fight against evil—they make it a road trip you never want to end.\r\n\r\n**The Balance Between Monster-of-the-Week, Epic Mythology, and Meta Episodes**\r\nIf _Supernatural_ had stuck to just one formula, it wouldn’t have lasted 15 seasons. What makes this show work so brilliantly is its ability to walk the line between gripping standalone episodes (the infamous “monster-of-the-week” format), sprawling multi-season myth arcs, and bold, fourth-wall-breaking meta episodes that drag you deeper into the _Supernatural_ universe with a wink and a smirk. This is a balancing act most shows can’t pull off—but _Supernatural_ makes it look effortless.\r\n\r\nThe monster-of-the-week episodes are where the show leans into its roots. These are the stories that feel like urban legends brought to life: Wendigos, shapeshifters, Bloody Mary—all the creatures you grew up fearing—_Supernatural_ served them up with eerie intensity. These episodes kept the show grounded, reminding us that no matter how high the stakes got, at its heart, it was about two brothers solving mysteries in the dark.\r\n\r\nBut then, _Supernatural_ did something even smarter—it built a mythos that stretched far beyond the usual ghost story. As the series unfolded, it cracked open a bigger mythology, introducing demons, angels, Lucifer, and eventually, God Himself. And it wasn’t just expanding the stakes—it was creating an entire universe. That seamless switch from local hauntings to biblical showdowns is what gives the series its epic scale. The transition from “what’s that creepy thing in the dark?” to “oh, we’re fighting the actual apocalypse now” shouldn’t have worked this well. But somehow, it did.\r\n\r\nThen came the secret weapon: _Supernatural’s_ ability to laugh at itself. The show broke the fourth wall like no other, delivering meta episodes that poked fun at its own genre, fandom, and even its actors. These episodes weren’t just gimmicks—they were masterclasses in self-awareness, using humor to not only keep the audience entertained but also to highlight the show’s versatility. Episodes like “The French Mistake,” where Sam and Dean are tossed into an alternate universe where they’re actors in a TV show called _Supernatural_, are the perfect blend of absurdity and cleverness. You’ve got the Winchesters trying to figure out what the hell is going on, while Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki poke fun at their real lives. It’s a ridiculous concept, but it works—and it’s just one example of how the show seamlessly merged its deep, emotional storytelling with moments of pure comedic genius.\r\n\r\nBut it didn’t stop there. Whether it was “Changing Channels,” which hilariously transported Sam and Dean through various TV show genres (hello, sitcom laugh track), or “Fan Fiction,” which took meta to a whole new level by turning the spotlight on the _Supernatural_ fandom, these episodes dared to break the rules of traditional TV. And yet, even while poking fun at itself, the show never lost sight of its core themes: family, destiny, and the ongoing struggle between good and evil.\r\n\r\nThese meta episodes gave the show room to breathe between the high-stakes mythology arcs and the creature-hunting adventures, allowing for moments of levity and creativity that kept fans hooked. One week, you’re watching Sam and Dean battle a vengeful spirit, and the next, they’re trapped in a fake version of their own lives or hilariously battling their way through TV parodies. And the best part? It never felt out of place. _Supernatural_ had built such a flexible, layered world that even the most outlandish episodes fit into its broader narrative.\r\n\r\nThe show’s humor and willingness to poke fun at its own genre only strengthened its bond with fans. We weren’t just watching two brothers take on the apocalypse; we were in on the joke, laughing along as the writers playfully deconstructed the show’s own tropes. The fourth-wall-breaking episodes added a new dimension to the series, proving that _Supernatural_ wasn’t afraid to take risks, mock itself, or fully embrace the weird.\r\n\r\nWhether you’re watching an emotional myth arc about Heaven and Hell, a spooky creature-of-the-week, or a meta episode that leaves you laughing out loud, _Supernatural_ mastered the art of keeping its audience on their toes. One moment you’re on the edge of your seat, the next you’re in stitches—but no matter what, you’re invested. That’s the magic of this show: the perfect balance of humor, horror, and heart.\r\n\r\n**Family and Sacrifice: The Heartbeat of Supernatural**\r\n“Saving people, hunting things—the family business.” It’s more than a catchphrase. For the Winchesters, it’s a creed. Right from the first episode, _Supernatural_ drives home the fact that the Winchester family isn’t like most others. They don’t sit down for Sunday dinners or swap happy holiday stories. Their legacy is blood-soaked, hard-earned, and filled with impossible choices. For Sam and Dean, family isn’t just about genetics—it’s about loyalty, sacrifice, and the willingness to walk into hell (sometimes literally) to save the people you love.\r\n\r\nBut _Supernatural_ doesn’t stop at biological bonds. While the show’s emotional center is Sam and Dean’s unbreakable connection, it constantly reminds us that family is about more than blood. From Bobby Singer to Castiel, Charlie Bradbury to Jodie Mills, the Winchesters build a found family around them, one forged in battle and trust.\r\n\r\nBobby isn’t just the grizzled hunter who helps from the sidelines. He’s the father figure the brothers desperately needed after losing their own. And when Bobby sacrifices everything to protect Sam and Dean, it’s not out of duty—it’s love. His gruff “idjits” is always laced with affection, making his inevitable departure one of the series’ most heartbreaking moments. For Bobby, family meant being willing to give everything, even when there was nothing left to give.\r\n\r\nThen there’s Castiel. The angel who started off as Heaven’s loyal soldier quickly became something far more complex—a brother in arms, a friend, and ultimately, family. Castiel’s arc is one of the most poignant examples of _Supernatural’s_ exploration of loyalty. His decision to fall from grace, to fight alongside the Winchesters instead of against them, represents the power of chosen family. Castiel’s ultimate sacrifice for Dean—driven by love, not duty—solidifies his place as a Winchester, proving that sometimes, the strongest family ties aren’t the ones we’re born with, but the ones we create.\r\n\r\nAnd who could forget the fierce women of _Supernatural_? Charlie Bradbury might not have been born into the hunter life, but she earned her place through loyalty and guts. As a geeky, fearless hacker turned badass hunter, Charlie shows us that family can be chosen. Her bond with the Winchesters ran deep, and her tragic end still stings because she wasn’t just a friend—she was family. Jodie Mills, on the other hand, stepped into the role of protector, becoming a mother figure to a new generation of hunters. She didn’t have to take these lost girls under her wing, but she did because, in _Supernatural_, family is about showing up when no one else will.\r\n\r\nTime and time again, _Supernatural_ shows us that family means sacrifice. The Winchesters ask themselves the hard question: how far would you go for the people you love? And the answer is always: further than you think. Whether it’s Dean making deals with demons to save Sam, or Sam risking his life to pull Dean from the brink, their story is one of selflessness—sometimes to a fault.\r\n\r\nAnd that’s where the real beauty of the show lies. It’s not just about hunting monsters or saving the world. It’s about the people you’re willing to stand beside in the fight. It’s about the love, loyalty, and sacrifice that define the Winchester legacy. Because in _Supernatural_, family isn’t just a bond—it’s a battle. And even when the stakes are cosmic, it always comes down to saving people and hunting things, because that’s the family business.\r\n\r\n**The Fandom That Kept It Alive: The Power of the SPN Family**\r\nWhen we talk about _Supernatural_ unprecedented 15-season run, there’s one undeniable force that carried the show through every twist, turn, and apocalyptic showdown: the SPN Family. It’s more than just a fanbase—this community of devoted viewers, creators, and passionate advocates became the backbone of _Supernatural_, driving its success and influencing the way fandoms interact with television today. From launching fan campaigns to attending conventions, the SPN Family didn’t just support the show—they helped shape it.\r\n\r\nWhat makes _Supernatural_ unique is how it built this loyal, worldwide following, despite starting off as an under-the-radar series on The WB (remember that network?). Back in 2005, _Supernatural_ premiered to modest ratings, with no guarantee it would survive past its first season. The show might have flown under the radar of the mainstream critics, but the fans? They saw something special.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t long before the SPN Family transformed into a cultural powerhouse, keeping _Supernatural_ alive through low ratings, network shifts, and even a writer’s strike. While some shows rely solely on their storylines or cast to stay afloat, _Supernatural_ had something extra: a fanbase that wasn’t afraid to fight for it. These weren’t casual viewers tuning in once a week—they were engaged, connected, and fiercely loyal.\r\n\r\nFan conventions were one of the biggest drivers behind this loyalty. Year after year, conventions like Creation Entertainment’s Salute to Supernatural became pilgrimage spots for fans to meet their favorite cast members, share their art, theories, and stories, and celebrate their love for the show. For many, these events were more than just photo-ops or autograph sessions—they were community-building hubs. Here, fans bonded over their shared love of all things Winchester, forming friendships and creating memories that transcended the screen.\r\nBut what truly sets the SPN Family apart is its activism. The fans didn’t just watch and engage—they gave back. From charity drives inspired by the cast to campaigns like Random Acts (founded by Misha Collins, the actor behind Castiel), the SPN Family showed that they were willing to take their love for the show and channel it into positive real-world change. It’s this deeper level of engagement that sets them apart from your average fandom.\r\n\r\nAnd here’s the thing—the _Supernatural_ team knew how much the fandom mattered. They weren’t just passive observers—they embraced the SPN Family, making them a part of the narrative. Episodes like “Fan Fiction” and “The Monster at the End of This Book” celebrated the fans in a way no other series had done before, blending real-life fandom with the fictional world of the Winchesters. In the meta episodes, the show didn’t just break the fourth wall—it leaned into it, acknowledging fan fiction, fan theories, and even shipping (Dean/Cas, anyone?) with a wink and a nod.\r\n\r\nMore than once, the SPN Family made the impossible happen. After all, it was fan dedication that helped push _Supernatural_ into its 15th season, a feat almost unheard of in genre television. And when the show finally aired its last episode, the fandom didn’t just disappear. The community, built over 15 years of love, continues to thrive through fan projects, conventions, and online spaces dedicated to keeping the _Supernatural_ spirit alive.\r\n\r\nIn an age where shows often live and die by network decisions or fluctuating ratings, _Supernatural_ proved that the voice of the fans could be louder than any number crunching in a studio boardroom. The SPN Family wasn’t just a group of people who liked a show—they were the fuel that kept the engine running, year after year, apocalypse after apocalypse.\r\n\r\nSo, while the Winchesters may have closed the final chapter of their story, the SPN Family ensures that the legacy of _Supernatural_ lives on. It’s a testament to the power of community, proving that when fans truly care, they can keep a story alive well beyond its final credits.\r\n\r\n**The Legacy of Supernatural**\r\nWhen the curtains finally closed on _Supernatural_ after a monumental 15-season run, it was clear the show had left behind more than just a string of successful episodes. It had built a universe, a community, and a legacy that reshaped how genre TV could be experienced. What started as a story about two brothers hunting monsters morphed into a saga that dived deep into mythology, human emotion, and, most importantly, the concept of family—both by blood and by choice.\r\n\r\nThe show’s impact isn’t just measured by its episode count or ratings—it’s about the lives it touched. For many fans, _Supernatural_ became more than just a weekly watch; it was a constant through the ups and downs of their lives. The show’s exploration of loss, sacrifice, and the relentless pursuit of doing what’s right, even when it’s hard, resonated deeply. It gave viewers more than just entertainment—it offered comfort and a sense of belonging.\r\n\r\nAnd let’s not forget the way _Supernatural_ evolved the landscape of TV storytelling. It mixed procedural elements with an ongoing mythology in a way that allowed it to flex between epic apocalyptic plots and intimate character-driven moments. It embraced a _meta_ sense of humor that blurred the line between fiction and reality, giving fans episodes that felt like inside jokes shared by a family—fitting for a show that always came back to the theme of familial bonds.\r\n\r\nAs for the cast, they weren’t just characters on a screen. Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki, Misha Collins, and the rest became household names, in no small part due to the accessibility and warmth they showed to their fans. It’s rare for a cast to engage so fully with their audience, and that, perhaps, is _Supernatural’s_ real magic. The sense of community fostered between the creators, cast, and audience is something most shows can only dream of achieving. It’s why, even after the final episode aired, the SPN Family continues to thrive.\r\n\r\nAt its core, Supernatural was about more than just hunting monsters or saving the world. It was about connection—the connection between characters, the connection between the show and its audience, and the connections it fostered between fans around the globe. For 15 years, Supernatural wasn’t just a show; it was a phenomenon. And in that time, it proved one truth above all else: that family doesn’t end in blood.",

As in the audience is expected to laugh at the object itself without having an actual joke behind it. As in, \"This is a computer, Laugh at it!\"\r\n\r\nBecause of that we see a transformation of the jokes. The celebrity guests were once the butt of the joke. Mulder and Scully came on and the Simpsons mocked them. Now the joke is the celebrity guest. As in, \"This is Lady Gaga,\" or \"this is Michelle Obama.\"\r\n\r\nThey aren't spoofed or satirized in any way, the audience is just asked to laugh at the fact that they have a celebrity guest.\r\n\r\nAnd the final reason is the laugh track comedy, in which the Simpsons has none. That is no laugh track. But now the writing sets up the jokes with almost a pause for laughter as if the tracks were there.\r\n\r\nIn the past the jokes were piled onto one another. There would be several jokes stacked right next to one another in a single event. Now it has become joke, pause to acknowledge the joke, continue.\r\n\r\nBut no ones really laughing because it's no longer mocking culture, it's no longer spoofing the celebrity guests, and it's lost virtually all of its edge.",

  "content": "**Season 3 - SPOILER-FREE Review**\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @ https://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nStranger Things first appeared in our lives back in 2016 with its phenomenal first season, followed by a less amazing yet still entertaining Season 2. I was pretty excited for the third adventure with one of the best (if not the best) young ensemble casts ever. The acting in this show is unbelievable, even more when considering the age of most of the kids (14-17). Millie Bobby Brown is 15-years-old! Fifteen! Weirdly, the show will only be eligible for next year's Emmy's, but if she doesn't get nominated AND win, I sincerely don't know what she needs to do more. The seamless ease that Millie has in showing emotion and delivering those subtle expressions that only the best actors can achieve after years of experience ... She's going to break the Oscar record for youngest Best Actress / Best Supporting Actress winner. It's meant to happen.\r\n\r\nI started with her because last season I handed the highlight crown to Noah Schnapp (Will Byers) who also gives an excellent performance, even if his character has less to do this time around (similar to the debut season). Of all the young actors, Millie is so much ahead of her fellow colleagues that she indirectly diminishes Sadie Sink's (Max) performance. They have completely different emotional responses to similarly painful events. Not that Sadie isn't able to transmit her feelings (I enjoyed both her and her character a lot more this season), but jumping from Eleven showing 200% of her emotion to any other character is always going to feel that the other actor/actress isn't at her level (truthfully though, they aren't).\r\n\r\nIn addition to Millie, the other standout has to be David Harbour as Jim Hopper. This might be the funniest season so far, as well as the most emotionally powerful. Both are due to Hopper's arc and Harbour's award-worthy performance. He's hilarious, happy, sad, angry, drunk, frustrated, proud, ... His arc is definitely the one that serves as a pillar to this season's structure. Without him, this season wouldn't be near to the quality it is. Harbour's chemistry with Winona Ryder (Joyce Byers) is palpable, and that's basically enough for me to have a great time. However, The Duffer Brothers really deserve a lot of credit. The writing is some of the best I've seen in the last few years.\r\n\r\nEveryone hated Steve Harrington (Joe Keery) in the first season, but his development got such a fantastic treatment that now everyone loves him. The same happens with Billy Hargrove (Dacre Montgomery). I genuinely hated him last season due to how cliche and lazily written he was. Now, even though his backstory isn't anything innovative, he's undoubtedly seen as a more compelling character, which proves that Stranger Things really doesn't have a single bad character (main or supporting, at least). Max also gets a better script, plus her on-screen time with Eleven helped the character become more interesting. Nevertheless, how's the main gang?!\r\n\r\nWell, Gaten Matarazzo (Dustin Henderson) spends less time with his original friends, but his side adventure with Steve, Erica Sinclair (Priah Ferguson), and Robin Buckley (Maya Hawke), the newest addition to the show which is also the best surprise of the season, is also pretty entertaining even if it's connected to one of my issues (more on that soon). Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard), Lucas Sinclair (Caleb McLaughlin), Will, Eleven, and Max have a whole romantic subplot that I surprisingly enjoyed mostly due to how realistic and heartfelt The Duffer Brothers wrote it. Obviously, comedy is always a must inside this group, and I wasn't disappointed, having dropped more than just a few laughs throughout the episodes.\r\n\r\nFinally, Charlie Heaton (Jonathan Byers) and Natalia Dyer (Nancy Wheeler) also have their own inspiring journey, the one that addresses the most how people had to live in the 80s. Dealing with discrimination, workplace injustices, and different lifestyles are put in perspective always through unforced dialogue and/or events. I really loved this season structure. How each group of characters has their own side adventure so that in the end, they can all team-up together to defeat the evil within Hawkins. I never felt bored or less engaged in a story. Season 2 had that horrible episode with Kali (Linnea Berthelson), and some episodes seemed to drag. Season 3 not only has the perfect runtime for each episode, but the story that they cover during each chapter is always remarkably captivating.\r\n\r\nOf course, I always felt more entertained when Eleven and Hopper were on-screen, so their subplots obviously became my favorites. However, they don't take anything away from the remaining stories or characters. Evidence number one would be the best ending of the show. It's hard to hold off the tears during those last few moments, especially if you went through the same event (which 99% of people definitely did unless you had literally zero friends growing up). Technically, the show proves that you don't need a big budget to provide visual delight. From the appropriated costume design to the addictive 80s' style soundtrack, everything is on-point with tons of practical effects being employed. The CGI regarding the monsters and everything that comes with them are convincing enough, and the action sequences are mostly shot well. The editing gets a little sloppy near the final episodes, but nothing too serious.\r\n\r\nMy main and only issue with this season has to be the actual main plot. The thread that connects all of the subplots and groups of characters that I've been praising so much. Besides being very similar to the last season (monster comes, possesses people, and you know the rest), it's worse regarding the \"how\" and \"why\" the monsters came back. There's a whole story involving Russians, secret bases and codes, that feel too cheesy and over-the-top, reaching a level of absurdity that even affected some action scenes \"a la Fast and Furious\". It's unusual for the main plot to be as cliche and uninteresting as it is, while the side stories are astonishingly good.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Stranger Things delivers yet another fantastic season. Its debut continues to hold the #1 spot, but Season 3 is so much better than its predecessor. Once again, the characters are what make this show a massive success. Even separating everyone into different groups, the cast's phenomenal chemistry remains intact. Millie Bobby Brown takes her crown back from Season 2's highlight, Noah Schnapp, and guarantees herself tons of nominations and hopefully a few awards, due to a perfect display of her emotional range. David Harbour is right behind her, and then comes the rest of the ensemble cast, one of the best to ever grace a TV screen. The Duffer Brothers are masterful screenwriters, presenting extremely developed character scripts, as well as funny, exciting and entertaining side stories. Despite a less strong main plot, Stranger Things finishes this season with the best ending of the entire series. If you're not crying during the last 10 minutes … I don't know. Can't wait for Season 4, even if I would be more than satisfied to see it end its run now.\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

The latest season adds new material and fleshes out the overall back story. Its suitably creepy too, with yet more 80's style nostalgia and one of my favourite Kate Bush songs. \r\n\r\nEverything is well placed, great sets, great acting and thrills that keep you coming back. Its sets things up beautifully for the next season too.",

  "content": "Stranger Things is a highly popular science fiction horror series that debuted on Netflix in 2016. Created by the Duffer Brothers, the show is set in the 1980s and has gained a massive fan following due to its nostalgic elements, thrilling storyline, and unique blend of supernatural and sci-fi themes.\r\n\r\nPlot Overview\r\nThe series takes place in the small town of Hawkins, Indiana, where a young boy named Will Byers disappears under mysterious circumstances. As his friends and family search for him, they encounter strange occurrences, including a girl with psychic abilities, who calls herself Eleven. Together, they uncover a secret government experiment and a parallel dimension known as the Upside Down.\r\n\r\nAs the group of friends, led by Mike Wheeler, Lucas Sinclair, and Dustin Henderson, works to uncover the truth about Will’s disappearance, they face numerous dangers, including government agents and terrifying creatures from the Upside Down.\r\n\r\nKey Themes\r\nNostalgia: Set in the 1980s, the show draws heavily from the pop culture of that era, paying homage to iconic films and books by directors like Steven Spielberg and writers like Stephen King. This gives the show a nostalgic feel that appeals to both older viewers and new generations.\r\n\r\nFriendship: A central theme of Stranger Things is the strong bond of friendship among the group of kids. Their loyalty and bravery in the face of extraordinary challenges form the heart of the series.\r\n\r\nSupernatural and Science Fiction: The show merges supernatural elements with sci-fi concepts, including government conspiracies, alternate dimensions, and mind-bending powers, creating an intriguing and suspenseful narrative.\r\n\r\nMain Characters\r\nEleven (Millie Bobby Brown): A young girl with psychokinetic abilities, Eleven becomes a central figure in the battle against the forces from the Upside Down. Her mysterious origins are a key part of the story.\r\n\r\nMike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard): A caring and loyal friend, Mike is one of the first to meet Eleven and plays a crucial role in the group’s efforts to find Will.\r\n\r\nWill Byers (Noah Schnapp): The missing boy whose disappearance triggers the events of the series. Will’s experiences in the Upside Down have lasting effects on him and his family.\r\n\r\nJim Hopper (David Harbour): The town’s police chief, Hopper becomes an important ally in the fight against the strange occurrences in Hawkins.

Her strong love for her children drives many of the series' emotional moments.\r\n\r\nWhy It Became So Popular\r\nNostalgia Factor: The show’s heavy 1980s influences resonate with viewers who grew up during that time, with references to movies like E.T., The Goonies, and The Thing. For younger audiences, it provides a glimpse into a past era through a modern lens.\r\n\r\nStrong Character Development: The characters in Stranger Things are relatable and undergo significant development over the seasons, making them engaging and memorable.\r\n\r\nSuspense and Mystery: The constant suspense, combined with the mystery surrounding the Upside Down and the strange government experiments, keeps viewers hooked from episode to episode.\r\n\r\nCritically Acclaimed Performances: The performances of the young cast, particularly Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven, have received widespread praise. The actors bring depth and authenticity to their roles, which makes the show even more compelling.\r\n\r\nSeasons and Reception\r\nSeason 1 (2016): The first season introduced the world of Stranger Things, quickly becoming a breakout hit. It received critical acclaim for its storytelling, acting, and nostalgic elements.\r\n\r\nSeason 2 (2017): The second season expanded the universe of Stranger Things, introducing new characters and continuing the battle against the forces of the Upside Down.\r\n\r\nSeason 3 (2019): The third season raised the stakes with a more significant threat and further development of the characters, especially the group of kids growing up.\r\n\r\nSeason 4 (2022): The latest season delved deeper into the mysteries of the Upside Down and its connection to the real world. It also explores the challenges of the characters as they face new threats and personal struggles.\r\n\r\nStranger Things has become one of Netflix’s most successful and iconic shows, with its gripping storyline and memorable characters. It has built a large fanbase and continues to be a topic of discussion for both its plot twists and the outstanding performances of its cast.\r\n\r\nConclusion",

The characters were the sort of rough hewen, mature, resourceful people, you'd expect to find on a space freighter or in the military. It made sense.\r\n\r\nNow imagine mostly soft faced types, who feel like they belong teaching tutorials on a university campus or running a yoga class, in the same environment. Because that's what you get with \"Aliens Earth\". You could say its middle class leftist Californians, facing off against horrific, alien monsters. In the context of a dark comedy, it could have had potential.\r\n\r\nAs you might expect the sense of plausibility, raw realism and creeping dread, isn't there. The characterisations and acting, are none too inspiring either. An unoriginal story, that borrows heavily from the original films and even manages to do a bad \"Blade Runner\" knock off,  rounds out the sense of pervading blandness.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the whole premise feels unconvincing. I really don't know how they managed to make something so amateurish out of high quality, iconic material but well, they did. Not recommended.",

The possibility of the xeno leaving the ship wreckage, being loose on Earth and multiplying is not even discussed and is not a source of tension. This feels like a complete misstep for a show called Alien: EARTH. On the flip side, references to previous films in the series don't feel as forced as Aliens: Romulus. The new aliens and learning their abilities are one of the bright spots but the show is limited by its characters. Besides the stoic synth team leader, the bulk of the other characters are essentially children and haven't had any individual personalities written for them beyond that so their reactions/motivations are all similar and flat.",

  "content": "Alien Earth is a bold and thrilling entry into the Alien universe, and for me, it feels like the franchise finally has fresh life. What makes this series stand apart are the incredible new creatures, not just variations of the familiar xenomorph, but entirely new designs that expand the mythology in ways that feel both terrifying and imaginative.\r\n\r\nEpisode 5 deserves special mention. It plays like a self contained feature film, delivering more tension, atmosphere, and character work than many of the actual films in the franchise. I found myself completely immersed, unable to look away, which is something I haven’t experienced with Alien content in years.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, the classic Alien itself has grown a bit predictable over time. The xenomorph is still iconic, but its scares are limited by decades of overexposure. Alien Earth sidesteps this by combining the familiar horror roots with fascinating science fiction elements, particularly the introduction of new species that feel truly otherworldly. This balance of horror and wonder kept me locked in from beginning to end. Someone really thought this through really well. The weaving of the Peter Pan and lost boys story was great.\r\n\r\nOverall, Alien Earth blows away most of what has come before in the Alien franchise. It respects the original DNA of the series while finally daring to evolve it. The result is something that feels terrifying, fresh, and full of possibility. I sincerely hope this isn’t the end, because if there’s a second season, I’ll be first in line to watch.\r\n\r\n9/10",

  "content": "As a fan of “Lost,” I was intrigued when I heard that some of the same people were involved in the new EPIX series “From.” Unfortunately, the show doesn’t live up to the expectations set by “Lost.” While it starts off incredibly promising and has a unique feel, the lazy writing and subpar acting hold it back as the season progresses.\r\n\r\nThe unforgiving gore and genuine horror element that the show first offers are among its most distinctive features, but even these begin to wear thin as the season progresses. By the time I finished the first season, I couldn’t help but feel underwhelmed.\r\n\r\nAlthough a second season is in the works, “From” barely does enough to keep me returning for more. I would probably tell my past self not to watch it if I could go back in time.\r\n\r\nEven though I’m drawn in by the mystery, I’m worried about the show’s future. The writing is reminiscent of J.J. Abrams; the writers are adding mysteries at whim with no idea how to resolve them. Intriguing at first, but the poor writing soon began to sour the experience.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy mysteries, you might want to give “From” a shot, but be aware that it features subpar acting and a superfluous plot that will make you lament the wasted opportunities. It’s far from bad, but it’s also not particularly noteworthy given the calibre of television we’ve been spoilt by in 2022.\r\n___\r\n[From] - Season One: 6.6/10 (Fair)",

  "content": "Kaiju No. 8 (2024): A Monster Mash with a Heart (and Room for Improvement)\r\n\r\nKaiju No. 8 bursts onto the scene with a premise as intriguing as its colossal kaiju: a regular dude, Kafka Hibino, becomes a monster himself.  This unique twist on the classic kaiju narrative is just the first course in a series that promises a delectable blend of action, mystery, and relatable characters. While the story itself is a solid 8/10, with a strong start and engaging world-building, the animation quality holds it back from achieving true greatness.\r\n\r\nA World Under Siege: A Familiar Premise with a Fresh Twist\r\n\r\nKaiju No. 8 doesn't waste time establishing its world. We're thrust into a Japan constantly under attack by monstrous kaiju, forcing humanity to rely on the valiant Japanese Defense Force (JDF) for protection. This isn't your typical superhero story, though.  Kafka, our protagonist, exemplifies the toll this constant threat takes. He's not some hotshot teenager destined for greatness. He's an older man, burdened by past failures and the drudgery of a civilian cleanup job. This adds a layer of depth often missing in the genre, making Kafka's journey to become a hero all the more compelling.\r\n\r\nThe Power of Friendship: A Budding Romance and a Hopeful Future\r\n\r\nOne of the most endearing aspects of Kaiju No. 8 is the relationship between Kafka and his childhood friend, Mina Ashiro. Now a captain in the JDF, Mina embodies the dream they once shared of joining the fight. Their dynamic is a breath of fresh air in a genre often dominated by brooding loners. The show delicately explores the wistfulness of unfulfilled promises and the power of a shared dream, hinting at a potential future romance that feels pure and genuine. Here's hoping the series continues to develop this heartwarming connection.\r\n\r\nThe Mystery Unfolds: A World Rich with Potential\r\n\r\nThe series masterfully balances its monster-bashing with intriguing mysteries. The source of the kaiju and the nature of Kafka's transformation are just scratching the surface. Each episode leaves you wanting more, eager to unravel the larger conspiracy at play. The world-building is rich and well-developed, with details about the JDF's structure and the different types of kaiju offering a glimpse into the complex ecosystem created by Naoya Matsumoto.\r\n\r\nA Stumble in the Kaiju Rampage: The Animation Holds Back the Onslaught\r\n\r\nNow, let's address the elephant in the room, or rather, the kaiju in the animation. While the story is undeniably captivating, the animation quality is a noticeable stumbling block. Given the high production value of the series, the art style feels like a missed opportunity. The character designs are decent, but the fight scenes lack the fluidity and dynamic energy one expects from a monster-battling anime. The backgrounds, while functional, could benefit from a touch more detail and vibrancy.  Perhaps the animation improves as the series progresses, but for now, it holds Kaiju No. 8 back from achieving its full potential.\r\n\r\nA Promising Debut with Room to Grow\r\n\r\nDespite the animation hiccup, Kaiju No. 8 is a thoroughly enjoyable experience. The story is strong, the characters are relatable, and the world is brimming with potential.  It's a show with its heart in the right place, offering a fresh take on the kaiju genre with a dash of human drama.  If you're looking for an action-packed anime with a unique twist and a healthy dose of heart, Kaiju No. 8 is definitely worth checking out. Just be prepared for the animation to take a backseat to the captivating story. Here's hoping future episodes see some improvement in that department, because with a little more polish, Kaiju No. 8 could truly become a monster hit.",

  "content": "We have now watched every season of Midsomer Murders so far, and that is a lot. So you know we like the program. It took a few shows for us to get a sense that the it is a pastiche of police shows. I don’t mean that it is a comedy or makes fun of the genre; just that it turns it on its head a little.\r\n\r\nFor one thing, it seems there are always about three murders per episode, and they are not 90 minute shows. They aren’t serial killings; it just seems like for one reason or another, circumstances call for repeat killings.\r\n\r\nBesides the three-peat murders, there is also a sort of formula the episodes often follow. A lot of the shows either include a pseudo supernatural element, or they take place during some kind of festival or fete. People from a character’s past also play into a lot of shows, and if you are squeamish and someone says “What are you doing here?” Look away for just a moment. Plus, perhaps out of necessity since there are so many murders, they come up with imaginative ways of doing it. Not always plausible, mind you, but all part of the fun.\r\n\r\nSo it is a pleasant show. The recurring characters are likable and their personal plot lines provide continuity for the one-&and-done mystery for each episode. \r\n\r\nIf you are dubious but still give it a try, watch at least three episodes. It grows on you. If you have Roku tv channels, there is one channel that runs just Midsomer Murders, though I imagine not in any sensible order. Don’t let then20-plus seasons put you off. There aren’t many episodes per season so it goes faster than you might think.",

That isn't the show's fault of course. Due to that, I had to refresh my mind as to what happened between E1/16 and a lot does occur in S10. I enjoyed all of it, I particularly love how gory the show is at times while the look of the walkers continues to impress with each episode. I like the S10 storyline, very intrigued to see how the final season goes.\r\n\r\nNorman Reedus (Daryl), Danai Gurira (Michonne), Melissa McBride (Carol) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Negan) remain the pick of the show's cast, but you also have the likes of Samantha Morton (Alpha) and Ryan Hurst (Beta) in there too. Cailey Fleming (Judith) is still remarkable, she acts way beyond her young years. There are a few others who are good too.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying it's the greatest show ever, but 'The Walking Dead' is my standout show personally. I love it. Bring on S11.",

  "content": "Paul Cantor has spoken well of this series. So at a moment I started binging on this series.\r\n\r\nThe first season was okay. Not so good, but far better than the crap losers tell people ”you have to watch the first five seasons till the action starts”. Watchable.\r\n\r\nThe second season got more interesting. One has to get past the unlimited ammo, and the unlimited gas available. After all these are the stupid kids who wanted to make momma proud: I got a college diploma, it's Creative Writing. The interaction was okay.\r\n\r\nThe third season and things are picking up. Never mind the breeding the specie mission. These are individuals. And they are cooperating to get past the greater obstacles, than they are out, each on their way. Nice.\r\n\r\nNegan was annoying. He was over the top. And that was good. After all Negan is the Government: sadistic, ready to destroy anything that doesn't obey his whims, he has rules, and prisons, and reeducation, and justice.\r\n\r\nAnd everything was okay, up to season 8. In season 8, the team slowly turns into a nationalistic bureaucracy. People have to sacrifice, not to save their dear ones, but ”for the tribe”. The good guys turn into monsters, and they are starting to lead politics: they ”civilize” the outsiders, or kill them all, just like Negan. All the characters become toxic: from trying to survive, they are now planning how to massacre ”them” before ”they” ”get” ”us”. Disgusting.\r\n\r\nSeason 8 was a let down. Season 9 was deplorable. Everybody had a little Negan inside, ready to get out and choke humanity out of any living being.\r\n\r\nSeason 10, well, I should not have watched it, but you know: National House Arrest. Everything becomes a regular sitcom: more and more characters are injected. They characters are diverse, because god willed it. The story becomes so dull, they have to splice many stories, and blend them together. So Team 1 is about to find out something, switch, Team 2 does something, but… switch, Team 3 is certain that something, switch, Team 1 found out the house is empty, they are planning their next move, when they hear a noise, switch, Team 2.\r\n\r\nAnd now I am watching Season 11. Why? I have no idea. Maybe to say: I have watched it all. At least this is the last one, otherwise I would have waited for the next benevolent lockdown. Not only the boring stories are blended closer together, they are getting way beyond unlimited ammo: they get into a tunnel, to have some action, because they are not looking for anything in the tunnel. There is nobody behind. And in front there are bodies in bags. The zombies, after 12 years in bags, they are quite functional. And like the sensor in the fridge, one has to get close enough so they could start making the noise. And in the train there are zombies. And behind now it's full of zombies. And the missing characters pop up from the other direction? Where there are other zombies. What? Where? Or they raid a military base, Mission Impossible style. Why? Because. Period. Each time they waste bolts and arrows, but if they do the magical sleep, the game will replenish the stock after 8 hours of sleep.",

  "content": "Yellowstone, on its rugged surface, presents as yet another myth-making Western -- painted with the broad strokes of horseflesh, sunsets, and men clutching at the tatters of Manifest Destiny. But beneath the sweeping cinematography lies a brutish, strangely compelling fable about legacy, land, and the sheer inertia of inherited power. Kevin Costner, surprisingly, turns in one of his most interesting performances not by radiating moral clarity, as he once did, but by portraying John Dutton as a man whose grip on power is less a matter of brilliance than blind, stubborn luck. Dutton is not a Machiavellian mastermind, but rather a grizzled relic fumbling through crises, kept afloat by sheer historical momentum and the incompetence or stupidity of those around him. Costner plays him not as a titan or stereotypical hero, but as a man just clever enough to survive-barely-on the edge of his own fading myth.\r\n\r\nMore ruthless minds circle him. Chief among them is his daughter Beth, whose strategic cruelty and emotional volatility make her the true warlord of the Dutton empire. Kelly Reilly channels something genuinely volcanic in Beth -- her actions often so scorched-earth and gleefully malicious that she makes her father look almost quaint by comparison. If Dutton is the dying king, Beth is his fire-breathing enforcer, burning bridges and enemies with equal enthusiasm. And then there is Jamie -- poor, perpetually perplexed Jamie -- whose tragic flaw is not hubris but a spectacular lack of instincts. He bumbles through legal maneuverings and familial betrayals with all the tactical finesse of a dropped pie. Yellowstone thrives on this chaos: a kingdom ruled not by intelligence or justice, but by blunt force, inherited grudges, and the dumb luck of those too ornery to die. In that, it is less a Western than a cautionary tale in cowboy drag.\r\n\r\nPersevere through the show's arid overtures and you'll find, to your surprise, that it gathers momentum and even moments of merit-proof that persistence, though rarely fashionable, sometimes pays off.",

  "content": "Richard Castle is a successful best-selling author, twice married and twice divorced, living in a spacious Manhattan condo with the single actress mother (Martha) who raised him and a bright teenage daughter (Alexis). He has money, toys, and rotating women, but he’s bored. So bored in fact that he has killed off his best-selling character, Derrick Storm, a rogue prone to danger. Castle’s looking for something new.\r\n\r\nEnter Kate Beckett, a strong forceful female homicide detective. The fact that she’s also hot is irrelevant to her, but not to Castle. A serial killer is committing murders and staging them to look like kills from Castle’s books, so Beckett needs to interview him. He’s all play, she’s all business. She doesn’t think that he’s likely involved, but she has to interview him anyway.\r\n\r\nCastle is hooked. He convinces the mayor to “let” him work the case as a consultant/advisor, much to Beckett’s dismay, and the game is afoot. Castle helps solve the case, and the successful partnership continues so Castle can do research.\r\n\r\nAs the opening narration reveals, every writer has his muse, and Castle thinks he’s found his. He even bases a new character on her — Nikki Heat. A strong forceful female homicide detective who works with a roguish mystery writer to solve cases. With a small difference — in his books, the two are lovers, which Castle wants to replicate with Beckett. But like I said, she’s all business.\r\n\r\nSeason 1: Beckett brings the serious, Castle makes it fun. 4/5\r\n\r\nSeason 2: Season 2 starts with Beckett and Castle on the outs, as she’s pissed at him for looking into her mother’s case at the end of season 1. By the end of the season, Castle is starting to give up the romantic chase, just as Beckett starts to think she likes the chase. 3/5\r\n\r\nSeason 3: This is the season where Castle hits its stride. Beckett and Castle are in a good place after the first couple of episodes, they’re in their groove, and they’re even making progress on the conspiracy that claimed Beckett’s mother. 4/5\r\n\r\nSeason 4: Building off Season 3, this season really starts to gel in certain areas. Which is odd, because the characters are written so they are NOT gelling…Castle finished off Season 3 with a big pronouncement, and Beckett says she doesn’t remember it. So they are at odds for most of the season. They have their moments, and then they have stumbling blocks. While a lot of Seasons 1-3 were about Castle growing up a little, finding something to care about besides being a playboy writer, this season is about Beckett growing as a person, finding something to care about other than her job. 4/5\r\n\r\nSeason 5: I really want to love this season, and there are some seriously good episodes, like Ryan going undercover or the Rear Window episode. And while the average is higher for individual EPs, driving the season up to 4.0 overall, my overall satisfaction was down — the backstory just wasn’t working for me any more around Bracken, 3XK, Beckett’s mom, and the wildside of Castle’s Dad’s story (great premise, not awesomely executed). 4/5\r\n\r\nSeason 6: The season starts off with Beckett working in Washington, and the whole dynamic just doesn’t work. I like the 3XK stuff, and a Carrie-like prank. I’ll even accept the wedding episode. But not a great season overall, one of the lower average scores so far. 3/5\r\n\r\nSeason 7: As I watched the episodes, I frequently felt, “Okay, last season”. Quite a few Eps seem like repeats of story ideas they’ve used before or promising ones that go nowhere. I was initially skeptical of the “Castle as P.I.” plot device, but it isn’t completely batty in its execution, and it does work for the most part. Washington? Not so much. 3/5\r\n\r\nSeason 8: There is an episode near the end (E19) that is one of the best of the series…it is funny, it is interesting, it is vintage Season 1 and 4 all together in a big bowl of mystery with comedy sprinkled on top. A complete palate cleanser from all the Eps filled with Angst. Yet by the time I got there, the first half of the season was almost making me wonder if I would continue watching. Definitely near the bottom of the seasons. 3/5",

Now, after the second season, seems everything has changed. Drastically the votings, rating, reviews have increased. IF one more season with similarly powerful characters, story comes out, then it surely would be among the greatest like 'Dexter', 'Breaking Bad' et cetera. I am confident it will go up to the seventh to set up a perfect finale in the next half decade.\r\n\r\nI did not review the first season, because I was not sure it would get better in the following season. I thought it was a one season thing. Now I'm here with awesome progression in the second season. I loved every episode. I've rated a few of them are out of out as they are well deserved. Firstly, for this to get better was the characters. A couple of new ones added. Not some sidekicks, but yes, they were with a stronger hold in the main narration.\r\n\r\nI loved Charlotte, the Lucifer's mother. That's the best thing happened here. Particularly the casting for it was the best pick. Tricia Helfer was like never seen before hot. The way the season ended was sad, if you had loved her. I hope she returns none other than as Charlotte in the future. Aimee Garcia was another highlitable cast. Her inclusion makes the crime fighting more interesting. She's a mini Dexter, without the dark desires.\r\n\r\nEach episode was unique, but the overall story flow was excellent, unlike the previous season where each episode has one crime to solve. Here too with the same style, but some time extended further for the next part. There was an aim for story to head, but the way it was presented was good. Shared it all throughout the season, while each episode had its own agenda. Lots of humours, as well as actions, adventures, suspense and a bit romantic.\r\n\r\nSo, if you haven't started, it's time to do so, because as I said it will be one of the best television programme on making that you should not miss while you have chance to follow from the beginning itself. All the actors were great, a well written and shot series. The season's finale and its final scene created more curiosity in me going to the third. I'm hoping for another magnificent season, which is due in a couple of months at the end of the year (2017). Highly recommended!\r\n\r\n_9/10_",

  "content": "This show started in 2016 and has six seasons, ending(?) 2021.  It turned to trash around the end of the 2nd or 3rd seasons.  \r\nThe storytelling for the show or premise was a mortal female cop having to work with the Devil to solve crimes.  The Devil is on earth because he became fed up with his role as Hell's Ruler.  And the writers did very well with the Lucifer character.  Many aspects to the Devil being supernatural came through wonderfully for the audience, one profound trait being _Lucifer_ (**Tom Ellis**) refusing, or being under an angel geas, to be unable to speak a lie; so he goes around telling people the truth about who he is.  Not fighting this, or speaking around the truth makes the facet a very comically astute trait to the character for the show.  The way other mortal characters react to the news which is either to dismiss the claim outright or gloss over it as ramblings completes the humor; especially when they realize the truth through some supernatural display from the Devil himself.  And ofcourse the female detective, _Chloe Decker_ (**Lauren German**) also does not believe him, her job being based solely in proof and fact--evidence.  While there are numerous instances producing evidence to Lucifer's claim on who is, the detective still (ofcourse) can't believe it.  That is until Lucifer insist on proving it to Chloe directly.  To both their surprise, he finds out he can be injured when she is within close proximity to the Prince of Hell. \r\n\r\nThe show did very well, even if one could foresee where hetero partnerships in tv shows eventually go.  That is foregone.  It's how the show gets the audience there which determines if there will be a following season.  And I will admit, I did not like the show.  I felt it to be a bit contrived, BUT worth giving a chance.  I, personally, thought the devil could be a bit more of a bad-ass; instead of just what the guy appeared to be, a cocktail party pianoist.  \r\nOther aspects of Lucifer's divinity were introduced such as soul-deals being made, other angels, and eventually demons.  The first introduction to Lucifer's astranged family was _Amenidiel_ (**D.B. Woodside**), brother-angel, self-proclaimed greatest warrior of heaven's Silver City, and the right-hand hatchet man for God.  My first \"dark cloud\" of foreboding on the show peeked through when I heard Amenidiel address the Devil with the nick-name: (...jeez) \"Luci.\"  Pronounced \"Lu-see.\"  But I (with effort) dismissed it.  I told myself \"GIVE it a chance.\"  I did, and the show did not fail to deliver entertainment.  \r\nEllis and German's characters have good chemistry in front of the camera, and the plethora of well-known TV stars featured in the episodes, kept everyones' attention and pleased to look forward to the next show.  Other characters to become regulars co-stars include Lucifer's right-hand, the head Executioner of Hell (...sighs) Maze. _Maze_ is played by **Lesley-Ann Brandt** from cable tv's hit NC-17 rated show, _Spartacus_.  Maze's character is easily summed up (in a good way) as kung-fu Biker Bitch with knives and a penchant for extreme BDSM when in a good mood.  When she is in a bad mood she fills the role of Amenidiel's mirror opposite for the Devil.  The two are not on the same power level, with Amenidiel being the top warrior angel, but when earthbound, Maze has the upper hand in dealing with and understanding humans.  \r\nThere is _Dan Espenoza_ (**Kevin Alejandro** -- whose credited filmography is very strong in TVseries) as Chloe's ex-crooked detective husband, and their daughter _Trixie Espenoza_ (**Scarlett Estavez**).  Also introduced is Lucifer's psychiatrist, _Dr. Linda Martin_ (**Rachel Harris**), whom which Lucifer constantly misinturpret's her advice she futiley tries to guide him with.  Lastly was the (I think) sudden appearence of character _Ella Lopez_ (**Aimee Garcia**).  The plucky and \"loveable\" forensic specialist.  All these characters make up a pretty good cast and the writers did the show and characters justice.  The show looked promising, until...[que sound bite] >DUNT, DUNT, DUUUUUUUUUUHHHH!!!!!<  The third season began.\r\n\r\n**WARNING:** This review gets more personable from here, meaning if you like the show, the following will come off as a bunch of whining & complaining.  If you feel take-it-or-leave-it about the show then there will be some \"Oh yeah\" moments.  If the show had you at a point to where you throw your hands up like a BlackJack dealer leaving the table, then I appreciate the high-fives.  \r\n\r\nWhen the show goes down hill...My most glaring complaint was Amenidiel getting Dr. Linda Martin pregnant.  I mean, c'MON!!!  Woodside is 52 and I would have thought this guy was going _into his 40s_ ; not leaving.  Harris is 54.  And she looks _every bit_ of closing her late fifties!!  When I first saw the woman as the shrink I thought, \"She is too old to be wearing her hair that long.\"  And it was a sad attempt, just like later with Lucifer's \"mother\" being introduced, at making a woman not look her age.  When it is sooooo apparent she is the oldest person on the cast.  But this season happened when Liberal-Left thinkers were in full speed ahead and forcing ideals of interracial dating, virtue-signaling, inclusivity of the \"alphabet people\" into the viewing audience's faces as if Gay Judgement Day were at hand.  And along with Dr. Martin's geriatric defience of science (bars) came Maze's sudden ability to kiss women.  It wasn't a big stretch seeing as demons are not known for having a concept of shame, propriety, or morals but the clam-to-clam thing is NOT as endearing as the writers may think.  Girl-on-Girl stuff is exciting IN adult movies and R-rated movies; typically where nudity is involved.  Seen in any other muted venue, and...it's just...ew.  \r\nNext complaint was the shoe-horning in of the forensic specialist, Ella Lopez.  I say it that way because the show goes through an _entire_ season before this character is introduced.  And when she does hit the scene, Garcia's makes her character come across as too personally familiar with the main characters to the point of being overbearing.  It's...off-putting to say the least.  It's like literally _no one_ knows who this chick is, and since she is coming in on the SECOND season after all the other characters are established in the first season,  the vibe leaves the viewer thinking, \"Jeez, this chick is severely un-professional, and a borderline sociopath.  No one (in the viewership) knows you 'Ella!'  You have no previous interactions with the main characters!!  Why are you acting like the three of you had beers two nights earlier??\"  She is a stranger to the audience and the main characters, BUT she's the forensic specialist and now they _have_ to talk to her whether the audience likes her or not.  So, there's that.   \r\nThe third and fourth seasons are not bad if you can exclude the ever growing Liberal agenda being shoved into everyone's faces.  Charlie, Amenidiel's son gets kidnapped because demons come looking for a new ruler of Hell.  Lucifer's mother is trying to fit in with humans, and gets involved with Dan.  Lopez is having existential crisis because she dated a psycho.  And Lucifer after getting his mother to begin her own plain of existence, returns to Hell as it's ruler.  \r\n\r\n> **The third and fourth seasons moved along, but then the fourth season had to end with God becoming _senile!?_  Loosing his powers..!?  Then _joining_ his wife in her reality to be essentially a stay-at-home dad!?!  As Bill Cosby would say, \"What in the filth-flarn-filth is going on with this show!?!\"  Yeah.  I didn't have high hopes for the following season.  And I was right.**\r\n\r\nThe fifth season has Lucifer as a bumbling idiot, blamed for being an absentee father by a daughter (**Briana Hildebrand** -- Negasonic Teenage Warhead--[though a lot chunkier now], _Deadpool_), he never knew about, from the future.  She claims he disappeared before she was born; abandoning a pregnant Decker.  And let's just cast aside all that lore about the apocalypse should Lucifer ever beget a woman with child.  No, let's look past Lucifer making a fool of himself trying to assuage this young lady's misplaced anger over something he apparently had no choice or control.  Let's forget he lied to her in the second episode, something he is not supposed to be able to do, about him knowing she was his.  Hey, she's angry, gay--because ofcourse, her father wasn't around--, and something of an ungrateful bitch; so that means she can act out however she wants. >eyeroll<  Maze and Eve are getting married >eghk< when suddenly Eve's ex-husband, Adam, shows up. \r\n And unlike her, he's whiter than Johnny Appleseed & Wonderbread put together.  I thought this was supposed to inclusive & diverse...??  The one thing I can say about Woke-Hollywood nowadays, is that if a white guy is on the scene you can gar-rown-tee he's a bad guy.  Don't believe me, just ask Cain (season 3).   You'd think Woke-Hollywood would be able to stick to their marshmellow guns and find a well-tanned good looking Hispanic or Hindu to play Adam.  But noooooo.  It's not a show if you don't reveal how evil the white man can be.  \r\n\r\nYeah, Much like this review, Lucifer went on waaaaaaay too long.  I gave it 2 out 5 stars because I liked the first 3 seasons.  After that, the show has my condolences.",

  "content": "Lucifer\" is a woeful excuse for a television series, a devilish descent into the depths of mediocrity that leaves its audience longing for salvation from its torturous plot and laughable attempts at wit.\r\n\r\nAt its core, \"Lucifer\" revolves around the most overused and unoriginal concept imaginable: the Devil himself forsaking his infernal throne to play detective in Los Angeles. It's a premise that would make even the most dedicated connoisseur of the supernatural cringe in embarrassment. Instead of offering a fresh take on the age-old battle between good and evil, the show falls flat with its trite, uninspired narrative.\r\n\r\nThe acting in \"Lucifer\" is nothing short of painful. Tom Ellis's portrayal of Lucifer Morningstar is more irritating than charismatic, leaving viewers yearning for a more captivating devil to grace the screen. The supporting cast fares no better, with performances that range from wooden to outright cringe-worthy. The attempts at humour are so forced and awkward that they often elicit groans instead of laughs.\r\n\r\nThe show's writing is equally abysmal. The dialogue is filled with clunky one-liners and contrived attempts at clever wordplay that would make even the most hackneyed stand-up comedian wince. The attempts at exploring moral and ethical dilemmas are shallow at best, reducing complex issues to simplistic and predictable resolutions.\r\n\r\nOne of the most egregious offenses of \"Lucifer\" is its blatant misuse of religious and mythological elements. The show's portrayal of celestial and infernal realms is nothing short of sacrilegious, reducing profound religious themes to nothing more than a backdrop for mediocre crime-solving escapades. It's disrespectful to both religious believers and those who appreciate thoughtful storytelling.\r\n\r\nThe special effects and production values are subpar, to say the least. The supernatural elements, including Lucifer's wings and powers, are rendered with all the finesse of a low-budget B-movie. The show's depiction of hell is equally underwhelming, lacking the grandeur or terror that one would expect.\r\n\r\nIn summary, \"Lucifer\" is a satanic series in the worst sense of the word—a soulless, uninspired, and downright painful viewing experience. It takes a potentially intriguing premise and squanders it on a poorly executed, cringe-inducing mess of a show. If you value your time and sanity, steer clear of this devilish disaster of a series.",

It's just what it does has been done a thousand times before.\"\r\n\r\nAnd that is a sentiment I held true when it came out, it did things well, but it was just like too many other shows that all had the same relative concept. \r\n\r\nNow, well, now it's starting to grow on me.  The characters are developed out of the NCIS/Law and Order you can take one show, put the dialog into the other and the viewer won't really notice format.  Which is great, the characters actually feel like characters.  \r\n\r\nAnd the plot is becoming more and more outlandish and soap operaish in the best possible way.  It's moved into pure entertainment.  It's gone from been there don that to actually a fun show with characters I am invested in, and now I'm glad that my wife subjects me to it.\r\n\r\nSo.... I'm keeping the original review here because, you know, show people how your mind can be change and all, and I am revising it.  \r\n\r\nThe first few seasons are a serious... meh, seen it before... but it's actually grown into something fun and watchable.\r\n\r\nIt's shocking for something that I've seen so many times before.\r\n\r\nOriginal Review:\r\n\r\nMy fiance watches it. I've seen it before.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing particularly bad about it. The stories are well written. It's well acted. It can be engaging.\r\n\r\nBut...I watched ER back in the 90s. I've seen Chicago Fire. I've seen Hill Street Blues. I've seen Law and Order. CHIPS, Baywatch, you name it.\r\n\r\nMy issue with it is that it's just like so many other other dramas that I watched over the years that I can't really bring myself to care that much about it. But I won't fault it for quality, what it does it does well. It's just what it does has been done a thousand times before.",

The precision in the denunciation of The Boys is one of its strongest points since satire towards these characters is not new, but combining it with the theme of corporate America and wild capitalism gives it a clear differential touch.\r\n\r\nThe series is a total hit and is perfectly developed, to the point of making it impossible to miss because chapter by chapter the anguish increases. So if you have free time, I strongly recommend you to watch this satirical series.",

All characters are equally unlikable scumbags, which may be a part of the original design, but the viewer doesn't know who to root for as the story goes on and more detestable superficiality of the once sympathetic character gets frittered away. Gore and sex are always fun, but in this case the series tries so hard and goes so overboard that anyone who dares to watch the series through might as well have a barf bag on hand. \r\nSo much hateful political rhetoric, so much woke, so much racist agenda, so much sexism, that I'm not looking forward to going any further than season 3.

What I personally found even more odious, in the current season (4) is the belittling of those who question the mainstream. Yes, to question the established narrative is to  be a rube, a fool, a bumpkin, a nobody, who waves a flag and blows an air horn.\r\n\r\nOf course, ironically the mainstream, especially the mainstream media, have never been more doubted. Small wonder they have taken to dosing peoples entertainment in a clumsily transparent attempt, to lure the \"sheep' back into the pen. \r\n\r\nSuffice to say, lots of wasted potential here. Decent acting, some excellent idea's, all buried beneath thick cheesy layers of mainstream conformism. Ironically, the complete antithesis of the so called reactionary individualism, allegedly inherent, in the series key characters.\r\n\r\nIn summary, when ersatz counter culture is a counter for legitimate counter culture. This series started out well but now its subverting nothing. Its just another pitch, for mainstream woke conformism.

The 2nd season though was far from that. I give the first season a 95%. I give season 2 and 50%. maybe since the 2nd season is split in half and made into a 3rd by netflix, but the character building was not good. They were lazy and reused half the games. Just felt corney and rushed. Out of such an amazing 2nd season, they had so much they could have done to follow up and they really dropped the ball on it.",

The story follows 456 desperate contestants competing in deadly children’s games for a massive cash prize, exposing the brutal extremes of capitalism and human desperation. Hwang Dong-hyuk’s sharp writing and direction, paired with standout performances—especially Lee Jung-jae as the flawed Seong Gi-hun—create a visceral, emotionally charged experience. The vibrant visuals and haunting score amplify the tension, though some plot twists feel predictable. It’s a provocative, binge-worthy series that lingers long after the credits roll. 4.5/5 stars.**",

  "content": "I'll be brief.  I am a black man, and I do not appreciate homsexuality being put into black characers.  I cannot be as candid as I wish about this series, but I will be honest as I can.\r\n\r\nI like sex.  I like movies and shows where sexual nudity is a strong possibility.  I have no problem seeing a naked man, although I can see why entertainment has kept the naked man out of view of the camera all these many years up to 2010.  Male genitals are not very...appealing, aestetically; nor are they all that impressive.  But in a world of false equality, \"what's good for goose is good for the gander\", eh? \r\n\r\nBut I digress.  I like movies and shows dealing with sex, but I cannot muster the same vigor for watching a show when that brand of entertainment is mired in aspects of liberal social views.  CRT, homosexuality, inclusivity, gender indentifcation, mysandry, uneven outcomes of equity, and cancel culture are all carcengenic facets or factors that keep the \"enterain\" out of entertainment.  It's hard to know when the funny parts play out in a show with such farcical overtures; especially when people who hold these views first reaction to negative feedback is to brow-beat or bully critics. It's hard to write a story anyone care's about when they can't relate to any of the characters.  And the fact that these social views can take so much away from a show with a well liked aspect of life, is calamitous.   \r\n\r\nWhat care do I have to see a woman with an attractive body when I know (because of inclusivity) she will never get naked on screen?  Why in the world would I be interested in seeing two guys kiss, much less in naked in bed together?  Why should I believe a woman is the leader of a combat squad, when they don't even play first person shooter video games?  Why not flip channels when the lesbian character, with a guy's haircut and clothes, starts making out with another woman??  \r\n\r\nThe aspects of social liberal views don't make good entertainment because they are NOT norms.  If they are not norms then there is no interest.  If there is no interest, then every single script is a grindfest to keep the storyline consistent and believeable.  The same goes for this show.  I'm not interested because I have no anticipation for seeing those things.  They don't incite anticipation or interest because they don't appeal to me.  Personally, I get sick of trying to tell the males from females with shows like this one; and even then you have to wait and see who they pair with later in the show just to get some kind of context on WHY they make the choices they make.  Too convoluted.  Too unnecessarily convoluted. \r\n\r\nAnd even if this show is supposedly doing well ratings wise, I'd take that with a lot of salt.  Because the 'alphabet people' have the money to buy reviews.  If I have to say, I'd say my critique would be on the Popcorn Viewers' side of \"Rotten Red Vegtables.\"  And it is not high at all.  I didn't rate this show because even half a star is too much credit.  You don't boost mediocrity. You turn your back on it.",

  "content": "This is a good show. My wife watched the entire set of series without me as it seemed we already had a lot to watch together. She enjoyed it and at some point I decided to watch it and she elected to watch it again with me. \r\n\r\nIt is very witty and intelligent and, if you don’t mind every episode using the same wit and rapid fire word association and social references on and on, it is great fun. Once in a while they take it a bit too far and a character who has not shown great wit and humor comes out with a jewel. I can understand the writers wouldn’t want to waste the line.\r\n\r\nThey have two Sam and Diane characters (Lorelai and Luke) as a “will they or won’t they” romance — you know, from the tv show Cheers where they bend every script to bring them close to a romance, but oh, not quite. A lot of shows have done it since then (and probably before also. I mean they kept Mary Tyler Moore single as Mary Richards because she had dome the housewife thing in the Dick Van Dyke Show).\r\n\r\nThe show does really well at staying consistent, especially considering how many episodes there were each season. So even when it wears a bit thin for me, (for example, the Kurt character really gets old for me as they seem to have him do absolutely everything a minor guess character could do better. Did they not want to pay character actors?) it is still better than most shows out there. \r\n\r\nI feel I should add that I usually wait until I have watched the entire run of a show before reviewing it, because sometimes even good programs deteriorate or jump the shark. You know, when  show does something totally out of character or unbelievable to boost ratings or juice it up. Apparently the term came from the long-running Happy Days when the Fonz was water skiing and literally jumped over a shark. He almost took on super powers, it seemed.\r\n\r\nI don’t think Gilmore Girls will end up there, but even then I could always edit this review!",

I can’t say we binge-watched it, because we watch tv during our meals mostly, so we never watched more than two in a sitting. But we did whip through the seasons fairly quickly.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of tension and suspense involved. They have cases that go on for a moderator amount of time, but at least one that ranged for over a season. \r\n\r\nIn some respects, Bosch is a typical police show detective. He is driven and stubborn, and pushes the line sometimes in what he does. He has an ex-wife, of course, but he doesn’t try to run her life or threaten her new love interests. Also, Bosch has a good relationship (mostly) with his daughter, and that is a good thing.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of subplots around his superiors, other officers, or peripheral characters, and some of it works better than others. Politics runs through the show as well. For comic relief you have partners Crate and Barrel, which are not their real names. They don’t do a stand-up routine, but they are a tad eccentric and a nice change in mood for the show. They have their serious moments also.\r\n\r\nTitus Welliber is perfect for the lead role, and we are looking forward to the next season. In the meantime, we get to see the actor in a supporting role in The Good Wife.",

He does what he thinks necessary and right, tends to avoid collateral damage. He's a loner, and perfectly fine with it.\r\n\r\nThe Reacher we get in the Alan Ritchson variant is a Hulk with penchant for killing; he leaves behind a trail of destruction and corpses.

Both enjoyable, similar topics, but very different in tonality and production.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne more aspect: the Cruise-Reacher is like a modern Yojimbo.\r\nThe Ritchson one is written like a power fantasy: invincible avenger walks through walls to right the wrongs.\r\n\r\n\r\nA matter of taste, really.

There's a one scene when an old white lady (who is lesbian according the show and was married to another woman) is kissing the lips of some old black lady. This is so disgusting... That actress is 74 years old and those bastards asked her to do this crap in show. Probably she doesn't even care about sex at all in real life at her age and probably she was forced to do this crap. It's horrible. There's a race mixing propaganda here too and a lot of blacks obviously chosen because of their skin color to push the propaganda not their merit. It feels like that show creators hate people who don't race mix, which makes them racists themselves. There's nothing wrong to go with your own kind.

  "content": "Invincible is so freaking good that it’s going to be difficult anticipating new episodes on a week-to-week basis. Its brutal action is mesmerizing, but Invincible has so much heart and meaning behind those punches that the show leaves an impact even when it isn’t throwing blood and severed limbs in your face. The voice acting is top notch and the story leaves you on the edge of your seat. Invincible has the potential to be one of the greatest animated superhero TV series of all time; adult or otherwise. \r\n\r\nFull review here: https://godhatesgeeks.com/invincible-episodes-1-3-review-gore-heavy-superhero-perfection/",

  "content": "What can be said about _Invincible_?  I know!  \"_the Boys_, it ain't.\"  \r\nWhat does that mean?  It means for this series, unlike like the comic book it's patterned after, is lacking in...backbone.  \r\nI find this series detestable in its lameness.  It's lopsided high swearing ratio to a negative degree of gratuity is the essence of overstepping resulting in underachieving.  It's just like that other Netflix series _Vox Machina_.  The animation series seems like it excessively swears in order to try and overshadow its lack of tits & ass, i.e., excitement!  Which is a real shame because that means it's falling under the umbrella of DEI/ESG and represent-tay-shone!  Those cancerous influences on entertainment that just keep on deteriorating any hope of garnishing fans, attracting followers, or achieving some sort of _positive_ agency.  \r\nNo one is looking for this series because there is nothing engaging about it, i.e., there is nothing to hold the male gaze.  We can get our fix of violence playing video games.  If we want to hear swearing, then we can call up those same friends we play online with.  That leaves gratuity (tits & ass); sensuality & sex appeal for you of the intelligencia (lol).  And since DEI, ESG, and representation hold \"respect of gender, skin color, and sexual orientation in such high regard\" as not to offend anyone, THEN that means there is nothing of interest or going to be anything of interest to engage one's want to view said lameness that is this series.  \r\nThose BS statuettes of wokeness rob and will continue to rob entertainment of anything remotely engaging, anticipatory, or (God forbid) inspiring.  It's just one drama after another and that equates boring, boring, BORRRRRINNGGGG!!!! \r\nI watched the entire 2nd season, and I can honestly say I felt for this season just like I did for the first.  Nothing.  Not a damn thing.  I don't care if there is a 3rd season or when that season will begin, play or end.  It just doesn't, as a straight adult male, do anything for me.  In fact, if you think this series is woke, you haven't read the comic for comparison. The comic is only slightly better, but not by much. \r\nIf you can stomach bland entertainment, then go for it.  If you have anything else you could be doing or watching, I say do that!!  It will be infinitely more productive than vegging out to this shite series.  \r\n\r\n-- Bob --",

Helen Mirren, who, to be honest, has never much impressed me, fits in well in the role of Brosnan's cunning, criminally deranged,  wife.   \r\n\r\nThus far, there's nothing new on offer here but what is presented, is, for the most part, inherently watchable. Its well paced, with solid narrative, plus creative plots and sub plots. \r\n\r\nIn summary, I like \"Mobland\". Alright, its not new, yes its overstated but there's still a lot here that's intriguing and engaging enough, to merit a look.",

I think those two above mentioned TV series are perfect masterpieces.

Poirot, brilliantly portrayed by Sir David Suchet is one of the best television shows in the world, ever! Even Agatha Christie's books are not as good as the writing in this show (thank you Poirot writers!). You haven't been gobsmacked until you've seen this elegant, suspenseful, well-written, and well-acted marvel!\r\n\r\nArt Deco became appealing because of this television's well design elegant sets. The soundtrack naturally complements the refined, stylish and nostalgic approach to murder mysteries that Poirot exhibits. The acting of the cast is incredible! The friendships of Poirot are gassers! There is the comically brazen off the cob bazoo, Inspector Chief Japp (Jackson). There is the attractive and fun timidity of our piece of cake, Captain Hastings (Fraser). I especially like the dedicated, organized, and caring tomato, Miss Lemon (Moran). Lastly, there is the hilarious Abercrombie whiz , our Ariadne Oliver (Wanamaker). They hold respect for one another; fret together through the maze and horror of murder; can still laugh; and never forget to recognize and value the nice in this world. Their working relationships and persinal friendships are a model for all.\r\n\r\nSir David Suchet is the best Hercule Poirot, a butter and egg man! His acting is as impeccable as M. Poirot's criminal detection. Mr. Suchet is so good being M. Poirot --- which he did for around (25) twenty-five years --- that it is hard to believe that he isn't really the world's greatest detective from Belgium (please remember, for Poirot's sake, that he is not French). The way Mr. Suchet walks; meticulously cares for his moustache; experiences the dirtiness in the world with the same disgust and need to clean as the rest of us; insists on the best of everything, as a consumer (like the rest of us); and dances with his little gray cells is amazingly real!\r\n\r\nI miss the early 20th century roadsters and fashion. I miss traveling in style with Poirot around the world; xplring the great and trying to understand the terrible together; and seeing Life through his intelligent yet innocent lonely eyes. Abyssinia from this road sister!",

The action scenes are not very engaging since the main characters are overpowered, but that's expected on a Isekai. The animation is good.

  "content": "**_Thoughts on Apocalypse_**\r\n\r\n> _In our new age of terrifying, lethal gadgets, which supplanted so swiftly the old one, the first great aggressive war, if it should come, will be launched by suicidal little madmen pressing an electronic button. Such a war will not last long and none will ever follow it. There will be no conquerors and no conquests, but only the charred bones of the dead on an uninhabited planet._\r\n\r\n- William L. Shirer; _The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany_ (1960)\r\n\r\nLess a stand-alone narrative than a sequel to _Murder House_, _Hotel_, and especially _Coven_, _American Horror Story: Apocalypse_ makes explicit what fans have implicitly known since Pepper (Naomi Grossman) was committed to Briarcliff towards the end of _Freak Show_ - each season takes place in a shared universe (as well as being a sequel to the three aforementioned seasons, _Apocalypse_ also features oblique references to _Asylum_, _Freak Show_, and _Roanoke_). In recent years, the show has unquestionably stumbled, first with the poorly constructed meta-narrative of _Roanoke_ and then with the horrendous _Cult_, leaving a fanbase yearning for a return to the brilliance of _Murder House_ and _Asylum_. _Apocalypse_ is nowhere near as good as those glory days, but it's a damn sight better than the last two seasons.\r\n\r\nWhen a nuclear conflagration wipes out most of mankind, a group of survivors find refuge in Outpost 3, one of multiple fallout shelters constructed by an organisation known as The Cooperative. The Outpost, tickets for which cost $100m per person, is run by disciplinarian Wilhemina Venable (Sarah Paulson), and her stern right-hand woman Miriam Mead (Kathy Bates). It's also home to obnoxious \"Instagram influencer\" Coco St. Pierre Vanderbilt (Leslie Grossman), her put-upon assistant Mallory (Billie Lourd), her camp hairstylist Gallant (Evan Peters), his socialite grandmother Evie (Joan Collins), talk show host Dinah Stevens (Adina Porter), and Timothy Campbell (Kyle Allen) and Emily (Ash Santos); two teenagers assigned a free place because of their \"_exceptional genetic makeup_\". There are two main rules in Outpost 3; no one goes outside without permission and full protective clothing, and there is no sex, on penalty of death. However, after eighteen months cooped up inside, with only \"_vitamin-fused gelatinous cubes_\" to eat and a single song playing on repeat on the radio, the inhabitants are on the edge of madness. Enter Michael Langdon (Cody Fern). A representative of The Cooperative, his presence concerns Venerable and Mead, as it emerges the strict rules of Outpost 3 are of their own devising, and have nothing to do with The Cooperative's edicts. Langdon reveals that many of the Outposts in the US have been overrun by scavengers, and so The Cooperative wants to populate an un-impenetrable shelter called The Sanctuary. Langdon is to interview the Outpost 3 residents, including Venable and Mead, to determine who will be taken to The Sanctuary, pointing out he may take \"_some, all, or none_\". Langdon, of course, is the murderous baby from the end of Murder House, and only Cordelia Goode (Sarah Paulson again) and her coven of witches can stand against him.\r\n\r\nI would imagine that if you haven't seen _Murder House_, _Coven_, and _Hotel_, the events of _Apocalypse_ would be difficult to follow. In any case, as a cross-over season, there are a number of returning characters. Aside from Langdon and Cordelia, there's the Harmons, Vivienne (Connie Britton), Ben (Dylan McDermott), and Violet (Taissa Farmiga); the Langdons, Constance (Jessica Lange), Tate (Even Peters), and Beauregard (Sam Kinsey); Moria O'Sullivan (Frances Conroy); Billie Dean Howard (Sarah Paulson); Elizabeth Short (Mena Suvari); Zoe Benson (Taissa Farmiga); Myrtle Snow (Frances Conroy); Misty Day (Lily Rabe); Madison Montgomery (Emma Roberts); Queenie (Gabourey Sidibe); Nan (Jamie Brewer); Stevie Nicks (playing herself); Marie Laveau (Angela Bassett); Delphine LaLaurie (Kathy Bates); Papa Legba (Lance Reddick); and, James Patrick March (Evan Peters).\r\n\r\nMany of the previous seasons of _American Horror Story_ have begun strong only to fall off towards the end. This was especially true of _Asylum_, whose final three episodes may as well have been from a different show. _Apocalypse_'s pilot, \"The End\", is arguably the best first episode since _Asylum_, and although the eighth and ninth episodes (\"Sojourn\" and \"Fire and Reign\") are weak, the final episode, \"Apocalypse Then\", provides a reasonably satisfying conclusion (albeit relying on something of a _Deus Ex Machina_).\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most noticeable thing about _Apocalypse_ is the structure, with the majority of the content taking place prior to the Apocalypse itself. About ten minutes into the fourth episode, \"Could It Be... Satan?\", the show cuts to three years earlier, telling the story of how Langdon went from being a baby in 2011 to a man in his 20s in 2021, how he came to be involved with The Cooperative, and how he came into conflict with Cordelia and the witches. The \"present\" is then not picked up about mid-way through the finale. It's an interesting structure that allows the audience to ask certain questions they wouldn't in a linear narrative (\"_why is such and such a character not at Outpost 3_?\") at the expense of some dramatic tension (we know the witches' efforts to prevent the Apocalypse, which comprise much of the season's meat, are doomed to fail).\r\n\r\nAs with every previous season of the show, the acting is exemplary. This season sees Paulson pulling triple duty as Venable, Cordelia, and Billie Dean Howard, whilst also directing the sixth episode - \"Return to Murder House\". Evan Peters does her one better, however, playing four characters; Gallant, Tate, James Patrick March, and Jeff Pfister (a new character introduced in \"Sojourn\"). And to nobody's surprise, Jessica Lange is superb as Constance, despite having only two scenes. However, the stand-out performance is Cody Fern. He is especially good in the scenes which show him still living with Constance, where he plays Langdon as a confused and moody teenager, a performance diametrically opposed to his 2021 Langdon, who is poised, confident, and quietly dangerous. Even after he learns who he truly is, the subtlety of Fern's performance elicits unexpected empathy for a character who is irredeemable. His playing of the exasperation Langdon feels with everyone expecting him to know what he is doing, and his concomitant confusion, is especially noteworthy.\r\n\r\nAs one would expect, mood is paramount, with the first episode doing a fine job of establishing the tone of the season. From the outside, Outpost 3 looks like a Richard Serra sculpture, whilst inside, Val Wilt's production design is all dark Gothic corridors lit by firelight, complemented magnificently by Paula Bradley and Lou Eyrich's gorgeous costume design. There are also twists and turns galore, with the first major plot twist coming at the end of the second episode, \"The Morning After\". Additionally, the camp humour of previous seasons can be found throughout - from Evie complaining there's no stewardess on their plane and reminiscing about how disappointing Yul Brynner was in bed, to a Satanist minister (Sandra Bernhard) proudly telling her congregation she stole money from a nursing home and gave it to the NRA, to an absolutely pitch-perfect reference to _The Final Conflict_ (1981).\r\n\r\nThematically, the show has always been hit and miss. On one hand, _Murder House_ told a story about a middle-class family turning on itself, _Asylum_ was a parable about clinical repression and religious cruelty, _Coven_ dealt with loyalty and the conflict between tradition and modernity, and _Freak Show_ was a plea for acceptance and tolerance. On the other hand, _Hotel_, _Roanoke_, and _Cult_ were thematically weak. Reading between the lines of _Apocalypse_, it's partly about how centuries of male leadership has led the world to the brink of destruction, something which can only be avoided by the intervention of a group of women. Indeed, one of the major plot strands sees a group of warlocks teaching Langdon how to harness his magical abilities in the hopes he may become the first male Supreme. Although Myrtle reminds them that \"_men are simply not equal when it comes to magical ability_\", as testosterone is an inhibitor, the warlocks are so determined to overthrow the matriarchy that most of them ignore the signs that Langdon is dangerous. In this milieu, the dynamic between the witches and the warlocks is an inverse of traditional gender roles, with men forced to justify their behaviour to women in positions of power.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are problems. For one, there's those two episodes that precede the finale. A hyperbolic depiction of Silicon Valley bro-culture, the characters of Mutt Nutter (Billy Eichner) and Jeff Pfister are a one-punchline joke stretched over two and a bit episodes. Elsewhere, \"The End\" features a scene where Timothy speaks in voice-over, suggesting he is to be the focal character. However, not only is this not the case, but he never speaks in voice-over again, making this scene stand out like a sore thumb. \"Fire and Reign\" also features a truly random and poorly thought-out diversion to Russia in 1918, depicting the murder of the Romanov family. The scene serves very little purpose, and feels like the writers were throwing darts at an atlas of historical mysteries. The Satanists are also ridiculous, so camp and clichéd they didn't even work as parodies. Additionally, the way the story resolves itself is a little too easy, whilst some viewers will object to the conclusion insofar as what it means for the ghostly inhabitants of Murder House.\r\n\r\nAll in all though, I enjoyed _Apocalypse_. The cross-over is well handled, even if the timeline is confusing (how could _Hotel_ have ended in 2022 when the _Apocalypse_ takes place in 2019 - something not addressed until the final episode), and the fact that so many actors are playing more than one character (occasionally in the same episode), really lets you see just how talented a group of performers they are. Better than _Freak Show_, _Roanoke_, and _Cult_, it's probably on a par with _Hotel_, but is nowhere near as good as _Murder House_, _Asylum_, or _Coven_.",

For me, it's the best season of _American Horror Story_ since the exceptional second season, _Asylum_. However, there's no denying it's a divisive beast – the type of highly stylised story that'll have as many detractors as admirers. _AHS_ purists probably won't be overly impressed. For one thing, it's a dark and very, very, very camp comedy before it's a thriller or a horror. For another, it leans so heavily into '80s clichés and slasher movie tropes that it's practically on its side. On the other hand, it's consistently hilarious, it's a brilliant parody of slasher movies, it doesn't take itself even remotely seriously (although it does have something to say about the media's commodification of serial killers), and despite the ridiculousness of the plot and the twists layered on top of twists layered on top of twists, it actually manages to elicit quite a bit of empathy for a couple of characters who were introduced as one-dimensionally irredeemable. And the soundtrack, wardrobe, and hairstyles have more '80s cheese and excess than you could ever imagine.\r\n\r\nWe begin in 1970 at Camp Redwood – a summer camp for kids in Oakhurst, CA. The show opens as three of the young counsellors are about to enjoy a threesome when they and everyone else in their dorm are butchered. Cut to LA, 1984. At an aerobics class, we're introduced to the main characters – Brooke (Emma Roberts playing against type), a shy and innocent woman who has come to LA to start a new life; Montana (an excellent Billie Lourd), a fiery devil-may-care extrovert who immediately tries to draw Brooke out of her shell; Xavier (a superb Cody Fern), a self-serious aspiring actor; Chet (Gus Kenworthy), a professional athlete who has been suspended from Team USA for the 1984 Olympics after failing a drug test; and Ray (DeRon Horton), a pleasant and friendly man with a troubling secret. When Xavier tells the others that LA will be dangerous during the summer due to the serial killer dubbed the Night Stalker, he says he's got a gig as a counsellor at the newly reopened Redwood and asks them to join him. All agree except Brooke. However, that very night, she's attacked by Richard Ramirez, aka the Night Stalker (a brilliant Zack Villa). She fends him off but the incident convinces her to get out of town. And so, off they head to Redwood. Once there, they meet Margaret (an exceptional Leslie Grossman making the most of a meaty role), who survived the massacre in 1970 and now owns the camp; Rita (Angelica Ross), the camp's nurse; Bertie (Tara Karsian), the chef; and Trevor (a hilarious Matthew Morrison), the activities director and owner of an exceptionally large…appendage. Meanwhile, Benjamin Richter, aka Mr Jingles (a scene-stealing John Carroll Lynch), the former groundskeeper at Redwood and perpetrator of the 1970 massacre, escapes from a nearby mental facility and is on his way to the camp with murder on his mind.\r\n\r\nThe first thing you'll notice about _1984_ is how immersed it is in slasher movie references and tropes. The show features a litany of nods to contemporaneous films (mainly, but not entirely, in the slasher genre), and even a few similarly themed movies from the '90s. I noticed references to Tobe Hooper's _The Texas Chainsaw Massacre_ (1974), Brian de Palma's _Carrie_ (1976), John Alan Schwartz's _Faces of Death_ (1978), Joe Giannone's _Madman_ (1981), Robert Hiltzik's _Sleepaway Camp_ (1983), Andrew Davis's _The Final Terror_ (1983), Ivan Reitman's _Ghostbusters_ (1984), Joseph Zito's _Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter_ (1984), Richard Donner's _The Goonies_ (1985), James Bridges's _Perfect_ (1985), Danny Steinmann's _Friday the 13th: A New Beginning_ (1985), Rob Reiner's _The Princess Bride_ (1985) and _Misery_ (1990), Jim Gillespie's _I Know What You Did Last Summer_ (1997), and Jamie Blanks's _Urban Legend_ (1997). And I'm sure there are many, many references I didn't notice. However, the two primary touchstones for the season are John Carpenter's _Halloween_ (1978) and, especially, Sean S. Cunningham's _Friday the 13th_ (1980), both of which are referenced throughout the nine episodes. For example, the show takes place in a camp that's reopening years after a horrific tragedy (_Friday the 13th_), whilst the man who carried out that massacre was caught, locked in a psychiatric facility, and escapes on a rainy night (_Halloween_). Indeed, the opening scene of the first episode is a carbon copy of the opening of _Friday the 13th_, where a killer bumps off two horny counsellors. There are also direct visual quotes from the movie, such as a character sitting on a dock with her legs dangling into the water, unaware that a body is floating towards her. The more you know about '80s slasher movies, the more you'll get from _1984_.\r\n\r\nNot quite a post-modernist reimagining of the genre, the show instead recreates the themes, tropes, and narrative beats by way of a modern lens which affords a lot of room for irony. However, it's never sardonically self-referential, with the characters winking at the audience about how ridiculous the whole thing is. Instead, the season could stand as a respectable slasher story in its own right, and in this sense, the tone is absolutely pitch-perfect. Take the opening credits. _AHS_ has always excelled when it comes to credit sequences, and so too with _1984_. However, whereas previous sequences are usually unnerving, the opening to _1984_ is a thing of tacky '80s beauty – shot on VHS in 1.33:1 (the recording even has some visible tracking lines from time to time), the pastel-infused credits are made up of shots of aerobics, tape decks, gaudy fashion, dodgy '80s video graphics, VCRs, Ronald Reagan, and roller skates. Meanwhile, the unsettling _AHS_ theme music, originally created by composer Charlie Clouser and sound designer César Dávila-Irizarry, is here rendered in that most questionable of musical styles – synth. It's horrible, it's cheesy, it's about as unthreatening as you can imagine, and it's awesome, setting the tone perfectly.\r\n\r\nAs in many slasher movies, the introductory scenes are perfunctory at best, doing nothing more than to provide a flimsy reason to put the characters in harm's way. And also as with many slasher films, which are usually fairly short, the pace is initially manic, ploughing through narrative beats, character revelations, and twists at a relentless speed (the first five episodes are told in what is fairly close to real-time). Along the same lines, the show hits classic genre markers such the campfire scene used to provide heavy exposition, the clichéd chase scene where the girl being pursued keeps tripping and falling over, the characters continually splitting up for various (dubious) reasons, the plethora of pseudo-POV shots from behind trees, and composer Mac Quayle's John Carpenter-inspired score.\r\n\r\nHaving said all that, however, there are certainly elements of postmodern-esque deconstruction at play. So, for example, the five main characters initially fall into a very neat archetypal collective; there's the tough girl (Montana), the jock (Chet), the laid-back party guy (Ray), the airhead (Xavier), and the virginal, non-doping, non-drinking, non-smoking girl (Brooke). However, it doesn't take long for the show to turn these archetypes on their head – Montana has much more than just a tough streak, Chet proves more empathic than most jocks, Ray isn't as clean-cut as he likes to pretend, and Xavier has unexpected reserves of courage. As for Brooke, for the most part, she adheres to the genre paradigms of her character type, even as the show sets about deconstructing and reformulating everything around her; the girl with the huge breasts becomes the guy with the huge penis, the black characters survive beyond the opening act, the quintessential shower scene upon which someone is spying involves not women but men, and there's a fascinating pseudo-meta defamiliarisation of the clichéd notion that despite being flesh and blood humans, serial killers in slasher films are notoriously difficult to kill. It's all wonderfully handled, and could only have been put together by showrunners extremely well-versed in the genre.\r\n\r\nAs with every season of _AHS_, the acting is superlative. Grossman plays the part that you would imagine would have been played by Sarah Paulson had she returned this season, and she leans into every nuance of Margaret's character – from her religious fundamentalism to her conviction that Jingles can't hurt her to her pride in reopening Redwood. Morrison has all kinds of fun with Trevor, essentially playing him as a porn star without the porn. With a constant twinkle in his eye, Morrison plays Trevor as, in essence, a good man, and one of the most empathic story threads in later episodes involves him. Villa is a revelation as the Night Stalker, to whom he bears an uncanny resemblance. Some of the funniest moments come from his subtle use of dark humour at just the right time, and his obsession with Billy Idol is a hilarious running gag. Lily Rabe returns for a couple of later episodes, and is as stunning as you'd expect, with one emotionally charged scene in \"The Lady in White\" giving us as good a bit of acting as you're likely to see all year. And then there's Lynch as Jingles. He's just stunning, playing the hulking Vietnam vet as a silent monster in early episodes, before turning that depiction on its head.\r\n\r\nThe other vital element of any good season of _AHS_ is humour, preferably of the camp variety, and _1984_ is no different. Usually, the best laughs come from the earnestness of the characters, who are blissfully unaware of how ridiculous they sound. So, when Brooke meets Xavier, he tells her, dead-pan, \"_I'm an actor. Not one of those happy to get a role on a soap opera or a Coca Cola commercial types. I'm a serious actor. I trained with Stella Adler. I'm method_\". Later on, he discusses the dangers of being in a coma by referencing Boy George's smash hit song, \"Coma Chameleon\". After one of the characters is badly burned, an argument breaks out about how best to deal with the Redwood situation, and when someone tells this character to take it easy and breathe, they proclaim, \"_I have breathed the fire of a thousand white-hot suns_\". Discussing Billy Idol, one character points out to Ramirez, \"_You can't sing \"Rebel Yell\" and not be a rebel_\", a point he concedes as pretty reasonable. Finally, we have Montana's obsession with the '80s, and her reluctance to move on when her beloved cultural markers start to go out of fashion. So when she's told, \"_you're '80s forever_\", it really is the nicest compliment anyone can give her.\r\n\r\nThematically, despite its campiness, _1984_ does actually have some things to say. The most obvious issue is media commodification of serial killers. Whether it be by making a movie or putting their face on a magazine, serial killers and mass murderers sell, and there's something inherently wrong about that. Of course, _AHS_ in general, and this season in particular, is part of that commodification, which renders the critique a little meta, but which doesn't blunt the edge of what is a fair point; why do we give serial killers cool nicknames and then endlessly engage with them in every way imaginable, thus giving them exactly what so many of them want – infamy. One need only look at Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who appeared on the cover of _TIME_ magazine not once, but twice. Why? Because they sold magazines. The media's sensationalising of horrific crimes feeds into their continuance, and although the show doesn't engage with the media _per se_, it does look at the contradictory place serial killers and mass murderers occupy in our culture, a place very much created by the media. \r\n\r\nAnd, of course, it wouldn't be _AHS_ without looking at religion (\"_All you need to have the freedom to do whatever you want is two things; God and trauma_\") and gender issues. Here we see a savage critique of the notion that female victims of male serial killers are celebrated as \"feminist heroes\", as if they'd rather be an icon than be alive. There's also a nicely written reformulation of the serial killer trope whereby women are not believed as they fight male monsters, and a very succinct dovetailing of the themes of serial killer commodification and gender paradigms, with Montana stating, \"_men do heinous shit all the time; carve up tits, fuck dead corpses. And, you know what, they're treated like rock stars. Fan mail, movies and books up the wazoo. And, somehow, it's always Mommy's fault for not loving them or the wife who couldn't satisfy him or the pretty girl who rejected him. Why are we always the scapegoat for sick men to blame their bullshit on?_\"\r\n\r\nIn terms of problems, to a certain extent, the season feels both too long _and_ overly truncated. On the one hand, there is too much time spent on explaining things the audience already knows and hitting character beats we've already hit. On the other, there is a disorienting and not entirely successful time jump between the second to last and last episode, and it feels almost like there was an episode skipped between the two, especially insofar as the finale ill-advisedly introduces an entirely new character (this sense of truncation isn't helped that the season is only nine episodes – _AHS_'s shortest yet). Some viewers will also undoubtedly find the humour _too_ camp and too frequent, undermining the horror element, whilst some will find the plethora of references nothing more than pastiche, intertextuality for its own sake.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this season of _American Horror Story_. It's not the most thrilling or unnerving, but it is the funniest and most self-reflexive. Strong characters, typically tremendous acting, and some genuinely heartfelt moments combine with great costumes, foolish hair, and a soundtrack of so-bad-they're-great songs to produce a season that might mean little to those born post-1989, but to the rest of us is an ode to the achingly familiar.",

I believe we had seen Jerry on TV once or twice (this was way back when a lot of people didn't have cable TV) and this series became the funniest thing on TV.  I watched it whenever I could but that wasn't enough. Finally, quite a few years later, I bought the DVD set and watched everything in order, plus I watched all of the extras.  It is awesome.   This is one of first series that I know of where you really needed to watch every episode in sequence to keep up with it.  Remember when TV shows had almost \"standalone\" episodes? You could watch them in any order and not get lost or confused or feel like you missed something. Not anymore.  Anyway, I know many people who didn't get it; 'it' being the Seinfeld/David humor...  but that's because they never would sit down for an entire episode to give it a chance.  And how can you expect someone to get it who can't pronounce \"Seinfeld\"??   It takes a very stubborn person to keep saying \"SeinFIELD\" even after you've corrected them a hundred times.",

Some of the finest TV Crime hours of my life. We have Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey in some of their best roles of their career. Especially the latter of them. McConaughey made the talk of the town with his role as the smart, and deeply intellect detective Cole and to be honest, i have rarely seen a role played out so well by an actor in years. He absolutely grabs you in and keeps you there for the entire show.\r\n\r\nIt is all set in the rural deep humid swamps of Louisiana. The photography here is top notch. It is shot in a way that you can actually smell the place while watching. It just brings you that close to the swamps of the south.\r\n\r\nFeaturing a great selection of music by T-Bone Burnett who scored Coen´s brothers \"O´Brother Where Art Though\" to critical acclaim. He is the number one man to bring in for some true Americana music to movie and TV projects. He seldom fails. It opened eyes to many new artists for me.\r\n\r\nThe show has a great momentum until the end. Somehow the end of the season, i felt, was very rushed and simplified. In my opinion, could been done smarter to justify the rest of the show. But that is just nitpicking. For why bother the rest of the show is near perfection in TV making and gives you so much to weigh in on. You should not miss it at all. It will leave you wanting to smell the swamps even more after the last episode.\r\nShame about Season 2 that was a bit of a disappointment to me. Although entirely unrelated to the Class-A first season.\r\n\r\nEssential TV-viewing.",

But underneath, it's about more than that – it's about personal demons, good and evil, the soul, American identity, memory, time. And as the case progresses, a conspiracy slowly comes into focus. There may even be a supernatural element. Thus was the first season of _True Detective_. And thus is the third. With one major difference – season one was ground-breaking, one of the finest seasons of TV ever made, a defining early example of prestige TV. Season three, on the other hand, is, well…put it this way, of all the shows I've ever seen, season three of _True Detective_ is one of them.\r\n\r\nOkay, okay, I'm being flippant. But there's no denying the similarities between seasons one and three. Now, this is not necessarily a bad thing – I mean who would want a repeat of the horrendous and universally panned second season? So creator/writer/showrunner Nic Pizzolatto returning to his roots for the third outing is, on paper anyway, a good idea. The problem is that because this season is _so_ similar to season one, it's practically crying out for people to judge it in the light of those glorious episodes from 2014. And the contrast is not flattering.\r\n\r\nThis being _True Detective_, there is a lot to praise – the aesthetics are top-notch, the sense of place is palpable, the acting is off-the-chart brilliant. And there are some interesting themes – racial tension, journalistic ethics, marriage, fatherhood, the shadow of the Vietnam War, old age. But this being Pizzolatto unfettered, there's a lot to criticise too – the glacial pace, the under-written female roles, the cod-philosophy, the (toxic) machismo, the clichés, the dreadful finale. The fact is that Pizzolatto (a novelist by trade) needs an exceptional director to turn his ideas into something resembling brilliance, to imbue his relatively quotidian script with a portentousness well beyond the written word. He needs a director with a keen enough vision to mask the fact that his scripts are actually pretty by-the-numbers. Season three illustrates this beyond all doubt. Season one had the vision of Cary Joji Fukunaga (_Beasts of No Nation_, _Jane Eyre_, _Maniac_) who brilliantly directed all eight episodes, presenting a very thin story by way of such unforgettable and unsettling imagery that it made everything feel deeper and more profound than it really was. Season three has such a vision for two episodes; the first two, which are directed by Jeremy Saulnier (_Blue Ruin_, _Green Room_, _Hold the Dark_), who was also a showrunner until he abruptly departed after clashing with Pizzolatto (look out for a stunningly beautiful night-time shot of a search party walking through a field, torches moving in front of them – Sauliner gives the image a haunting fairy-tale-like quality). After these two episodes, directorial duties were split between Pizzolatto himself and journeyman TV director Daniel Sackheim. Season three without Saulnier (or Fukunaga) isn't as bad as season two, nowhere near, but it's still very weak, telling a threadbare story that it stretches out well beyond breaking point only to reward us with the limpest and most poorly written _dénouement_ you can possibly imagine.\r\n\r\nThe story is split over three time periods. In 1980, in the fictional backwater town of  West Finger, Arkansas, eight-year-old Will Purcell (Phoenix Elkin) and his twelve-year-old sister Julie (Lena McCarthy) go out to play on their bikes and fail to return. When the police are alerted, the case lands on the desk of Wayne Hays (an insanely good Mahershala Ali), a tracker during the Vietnam War, and one of those guys whose mind never really made it home from the jungle, and his partner Roland West (a superb Stephen Dorff). The kids' parents, Tom (a scene-stealing Scoot McNairy) and Lucy (a wonderfully contemplable Mamie Gummer), who hate one another, insist the kids wouldn't run away, and not long into the investigation, they are proven correct. Shortly thereafter, Wayne meets and forms a bond with the kids' English teacher, Amelia Reardon (Carmen Ejogo), who has her own reasons for pursuing the case. Ten years later, in 1990, Hays (now married to Amelia and with two children of their own) is working a dead-end desk job and West is a lieutenant. In the same week that Amelia's book about the case is being published, unexpected evidence comes to light that changes everything. The Purcell case is reopened and West is placed in charge of a special task force to look into it. And then, in 2015, Hays, now a widower suffering from memory loss, begins recording an interview on the case for a true-crime TV show, pushed into doing so by semi-unscrupulous journalist Elisa Montgomery (Sarah Gadon). Talking about the case, however, stirs something in him, and he determines to finally solve the mystery once and for all.\r\n\r\nAs with the first season, the use of multiple timelines muddies the narrative waters in a manner that wouldn't be possible were the story being told chronologically – the jumping back and forward means that sometimes we have a lot more information than the characters (in relation to the 1980 and 1990 timeline, we are seeing events in their future), but sometimes we have considerably less (in 2015, there are aspects of the case that we aren't privy to, but which the characters know all about). Especially laudable is how the show handles the time jumps, employing a variety of methods that serve to collapse the three different periods into one another. So, for example, a question asked of Hays apparently in 1990 is actually a question he's being asked in 2015, with the sound bridging the picture edit; a streetlight going out in 1980 cuts to a key-light going out in Hays's 2015 interview; a shot of Hays looking through a window in 1980, shows a reflection of his 2015 persona; a single-shot scene in a car depicts the characters repeatedly changing from 1990 to 2015 every time their face is off-screen. It's really well done, and carries thematic significance insofar as memory, particularly its subjectivity, unreliability, and mutability, is one of the main issues being examined throughout the season.\r\n\r\nAlso laudable is the old-age make-up by Michael Marino (_I Am Legend_, _Black Swan_, _The Irishman_), which is some of the best I've ever seen, and is complemented by an exceptional performance from Ali. He plays Hays differently in each of the three timelines, and it gives the character a believable arc – in 1980, he's driven, confidant, imposing;  in 1990, a sense of bitterness and indignation has crept in, he has a shorter temper and less tolerance for things of which he disapproves; in 2015, he's become a vulnerable and confused old man with just a hint of his past acerbity. It's a bravura performance from Ali, who really does carry the show on his shoulders. This is not to say the other performances are poor – Dorff is exceptional throughout, with his portrayal of West more uniform and unchanging than Ali's (which makes sense as West is more of a company man than Hays), and McNairy is heartbreaking in a somewhat thankless role (an interrogation scene in the sixth episode is worth looking out for). Ejogo is also excellent, although she's shackled by the poorly-written character she's playing, about whom Pizzolatto can't seem to make up his mind. Is she an exploitive opportunist or an empathetic journalist looking for the truth?\r\n\r\nAnd aside from all this, there are some interesting thematic elements dotted throughout the show. Racial tension, for example, is never focused upon, but it's always in the margins, often unspoken. When Hays first meets Amelia (a black woman teaching white kids), he asks her \"_how is it here?_\", to which she replies, \"_it's fine. It's good really, for what it is. I hear something now and then. They're all poor around here; that's the main thing_.\" Elsewhere, he refers to his \"_redneck radar_\" and points out to West that they belong to different _\"tribes_\". Later he queries if West's promotion was related to his \"_pigmentation_\" and in 2015, Elisa asks him if he ever felt he was being racially discriminated against during the investigations. In another scene, he snaps at a well-intentioned West, \"_please explain to me the hardships and tribulations of being a white man in this country_\". The most direct engagement with race occurs when Hays and West go to question a black man, and tensions quickly rise. Although West points out, \"_we're not going to solve the racial complexities of our day in your front yard_\", the man still asks Hays, \"_how you gonna wear that badge?_\" to which he replies, \"_it's got a little clip-on_\". If only Pizzolatto could be that incisive yet subtle more often.\r\n\r\nSo if the aesthetics are good and the themes are reasonably well-handled, why is season three a dud? Well, for a few reasons. As already mentioned, it moves at an agonisingly slow pace, and without the visual gymnastics of someone like Fukunaga or Saulnier, the story can't sustain itself – it's stretched way beyond breaking point, lapsing into repetition and narrative strands that go absolutely nowhere. I'm loathe to say it's boring, as I think that's too negative a term, but my God, this story could have been told very efficiently in five episodes, not the indulgent eight Pizzolatto has taken. And yes, I know, it's not really about the murder-mystery, it's about the characters. I get that, and I accept that, and I celebrate any film or TV show which puts character before plot, but the characters here aren't very interesting, and they do an awful lot of moaning. There's certainly no Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) or Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson). Hell, there isn't even a Ray Velcoro (Colin Farrell). Hays is brilliantly played, but he's as dull as dish-water, and the 1990-set problems between himself and Amelia, which come to take up an increasing amount of screen-time, are so uninteresting and self-serving, they're difficult to watch (especially when we're watching them have the same argument for the third time). The point is that large sections of the season drag interminably because neither the central mystery nor the main characters are engaging enough to sustain such a slow-moving plot\r\n\r\nAnd then there's the finale. Good Lord. Okay, the finale of season one was weak. It was the episode when Fukunaga's smoke and mirrors cleared and allowed us to see that at the season's core was the tale of a serial killer paedophile. The conspiracy went nowhere, the philosophical musings went nowhere, the supernatural hints went nowhere, and the mythology (the Yellow King, black stars, Carcosa) all boiled down to a psycho living in the swamps who liked having sex with and killing children. It didn't ruin the season, but it was underwhelming. Season three's finale is about five times worse. It's so badly structured and written that I genuinely do not understand how it made it to screen unless there's no one willing to tell Pizzolatto that something isn't a good idea. About three-quarters of the way through the episode, with most of the season's questions still open, a character quite literally sits down and explains everything (and I mean everything). He walks us through every single event and answers almost every single question. It's horrid writing. To hell with the cardinal rule of writing for film or TV, \"show, don't tell\"; here we have a finale with a 10-minute exposition dump right at its heart, which literally tells without showing. I don't know of a single criterion by which one can judge that decision a sound one. The last episode is insultingly bad. \r\n\r\nDespite disliking two of the three seasons of _True Detective_, I still consider myself a fan (the first season was that good). But it's starting to look more and more like that first season magic had more to do with the director than the writer. Pizzolatto just doesn't have a unique enough vision to raise the show above the competition, not when he's allowed creative _carte blanche_ anyway. Much like the first season, the mystery at the heart of season three was never as complicated nor as awe-inspiring as it initially seemed, but unlike season one, season three doesn't give us much else to latch onto. The story Pizzolatto is telling and the characters who inhabit it are too weak to support eight hours of narrative architecture. And, by God, that ending really annoyed me!\r\n\r\nSeason rating: 2.5/5",

  "content": "Series 2: Below are my observations after watching series 1 a second time, so now I will briefly enter thoughts after rewatching Series 2. I can’t say I enjoyed much of this season. I should point out that it is great drama; it grabs you by the throat and moves you along through the river of violence and betrayal and prolific cursing. (I am known to drop an occasional F-bomb as are my friends and family, but if they all did it this much my Thanksgivings would be quiet ones without company). Plus I was hard-pressed to find people to root for here. The few I liked had little or no power and were, like me, just along for the ride. And I found it ironic that, populated with the modern flawed anti-heroes we get a lot in modern dramatic thrillers or cop shows, there seemed to be an old fashion tendency for arranging fit endings for characters, like a sprawling morality play. But this is typical HBO fare: rather addictive even as I grumbled about my minor complaints above.\r\n\r\nSeries 1: I recently re-watched the first series of True Detective many years after watching the first time. I don’t know if I will watch the subsequent two series again, and they are unrelated to the first series anyway, so each series should be reviewed separately.\r\n\r\nSo taking series one on its own, I found it to be great entertainment, despite the presence of a massive, walking and talking stereotype. I refer to one of the two lead detectives. Woody Harrelson’s detective Marty Hart is sort of a cliche character, straight out of many other police procedural mystery series. He checks off several boxes of that two-dimensional role: cheats on wife yet applies his violent double standard at the thought of her doing it, drinking too much, breaking the law to further his investigation, with his anger always near the surface. But I like Woody Harrelson and he does give a textured and layered performance, his sense of humor and how  he cares about the plight of people he encounters (except his family, of course), helped me forget much of the time how thinly drawn his character seemed.\r\n\r\nOf course, Mather McConaughey’s character is the opposite: he is complex, always philosophizing, capable of violence when needed but always in control. They are the odd couple of detective partnerships and they are conversely always at odds with each other while still having each other’s back professionally.\r\n\r\nThe plot is suitably complex enough to maintain interest over eight episodes, though I found the subplot with the motorcycle gang almost felt like action filler material even though it ultimately advances the investigation. And I was vaguely disappointed in the ensemble cast, particularly the rest of the detective team. We learn nothing about them as they lumber through the scenes.\r\n\r\nThe women in the detectives’ lives are sporadically interesting when they stand up for themselves. I found myself wishing that McConoughey’s doctor girlfriend character would get expanded and filled in, but ultimately this series is about the two main men and how the actions of others affect them. And of course, being an HBO original, you have the prerequisite amount of sex and female nudity.\r\n\r\nBut season one is definitely compelling  viewing, in the way The Sopranos was, however much one similarly lamented the excessive violence involved.",

  "content": "True Detective: Night Country is a gripping and atmospheric thriller that takes the anthology series to new heights. Set in the remote and unforgiving Alaskan wilderness, the show follows two detectives who must overcome their personal and professional differences to solve a mysterious case that involves a missing research team, a severed tongue, and a possible connection to an unsolved murder of a native activist.\r\n\r\nJodie Foster delivers a stunning performance as Detective Liz Danvers, a hardened and cold cop who has been exiled to the small town of Ennis for her attitude and past failures. Foster portrays Danvers as a complex and flawed character who struggles with her own demons and regrets, but also shows glimpses of compassion and vulnerability. She is matched by Kali Reis, who plays Evangeline Navarro, a state trooper of Iñupiat descent who is obsessed with finding justice for the slain activist, Annie. Reis brings a fierce and fiery energy to Navarro, who clashes with Danvers over their methods and motives, but also develops a grudging respect and understanding for her partner.\r\n\r\nThe show is written and directed by Issa López, who creates a captivating and chilling vision of Alaska as a place of both isolation and freedom, beauty and danger, darkness and light. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the stark contrast between the snowy landscapes and the cozy interiors, the eerie silence and the sudden bursts of violence, the long night and the brief dawn. The soundtrack is also haunting, featuring a mix of native songs, folk tunes, and ambient sounds that enhance the mood and tension of the story.\r\n\r\nThe plot is intriguing and unpredictable, weaving together elements of crime, mystery, and supernatural horror. The show explores themes such as identity, culture, history, trauma, and redemption, as well as the environmental and social issues facing Alaska and its native people. The show also pays homage to the previous seasons of True Detective, with references and Easter eggs that fans will appreciate, but also stands on its own as a unique and original story.\r\n\r\nTrue Detective: Night Country is a must-watch for fans of the genre and the series, as well as for anyone looking for a thrilling and immersive TV experience. It is one of the best shows of the year, and a worthy addition to the True Detective legacy.",

Each season tells a new tale.Thus, far I've watched all of season three and four episodes, of season four. \r\n\r\nWell crafted and intelligent for the most part this is an engrossing series, with what appears to be a supernatural twist, in the latest iteration, \"Night Country\". \r\n\r\nActing is of a high standard and characters are well rendered, with the kind of traits and flaws, you would expect to find, in real people. \r\n\r\nThe only downside is a dose of the the usual woke BS many of us could well do without.White people or more accurately, Europeans, are not responsible for the worlds woes, get over it. I'll add too, there's a thread of what I'd describe as misandry that's more than a little noticeable, by the 6th episode. \r\n\r\nIn summary, mostly well written, intelligent and engrossing. I'd have rated it higher again, if the woke nonsense and the misandry had been left on the cutting room floor, where I feel, it belongs.",

Hype can often be just that: hype.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Bleach, it was justifiable and were I younger, it definitely would've been that good. You see, the main character is a teenager who discovers that his ability to see spirits can allow him to battle transformed and evil ones too.\r\n\r\nSince the main character is a teenager, he does a lot of what teenagers do. He's impulsive and lacks foresight, somewhat arrogant,  doesn't admit fault easily or gets in over his head pretty often.  \r\nSometimes, his mistakes are very repetitive and seem to be a device plot.\r\n\r\nTalking about device plots, this series has fillers and a good load of them too. If you aren't into that, then look for the filler list and skip them.  \r\nAdditionally, what this sorely lacks is a version with all the flashbacks, intros, outros and fillers cut out similar to what Dragon Ball Kai did.\r\n\r\nAside from that, the world is well described, the lore interesting and the characters well developed. One is able to understand their intentions and motivations (even though they often boil down to the basic 6 \"sins\" wrath, envy, etc.)\r\n\r\nSeriously, if this had a supercut I'd watch it a second time.",

  "content": "In a television landscape where medical dramas have been less about medicine and more about steamy romance, The Pitt delivers the uncut reality of emergency medicine through a sharp lens polished with a vivid sense of humanity not seen since ER.\r\n\r\nNoah Wyle draws on his many years of experience playing Dr. John Carter on ER, but doesn't settle for a copy-and-paste approach with his character here. There's an evolution and depth to his Dr. Robby that separates his two extraordinary characters and makes this show a new experience rather than a papered-over retelling of ER. The Pitt delivers the experience of a shift in a busy urban Emergency Room by cutting out nothing; each episode is one hour straight of these doctors and nurses' experience during one day. Only partially through this first season and I'm hooked.\r\n\r\nQuickly growing to love (and hate) the many characters. There's a humanity to them and an authenticity to their motivations, their emotions, their skills, and their mishaps. The characters have a heroism to them that is driven by simple actions and the normalcy of a shift, rather than forced/unrealistic drama. Real onion-peeling character development is occurring and while some of it may seem like it has a clear end point based on standard television tropes, you're still not so sure.\r\n\r\nThis is the medical drama that rights the ship back to course of reality rather than steamy romance medical drama. A love note and honor roll for the medical professionals who struggle, triumph, suffer, and heal in our country's most challenging healthcare environments.",

The acting of the supporting cast is not very strong, the storyline is a bit obvious, and sometimes things happen too conveniently for the story to progress.\r\n\r\nBut the good things certainly dominate the bad things. The \"Dunkirk approach\" to the editing mostly worked well, even though ambiguity remained at certain places. I guess those will be cleared in the second season. Henry Cavill was magnificent as the titular character. The dialogues were very strong too, thanks to its source material.\r\n\r\nThe pace of the series was strong, and it picked up interest as the episodes rolled by. I, personally, preferred this over the Game of Thrones (I know I am going to get a lot of flak for this), but hey, choices, right?",

Such \r\nwas my interest, I shortly after played all the games and began reading \r\nthe books, now two years later and with season 2 about to come out I \r\ndecided it was worth a rewatch. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn my second watch I wasn't quite as impressed, now able to judge the\r\n show both as an adaptation of material, characters and stories I was \r\nfamiliar with from other works and also able to better analyse the show \r\nas a piece of television in its own right now that I could better \r\nunderstand the  quite convoluted plot and timeline. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Show is an attempt to adapt two collections of short stories that\r\n serve as precursors to the main witcher series, these stories are often\r\n only loosely connected although are often thematically related and take\r\n place over a huge span of time and place.\r\n\r\nThis could lend itself nicely to an anthology style monster of the week collection with common themes, characters and world building however the The show ambitiously tries to construct a cohesive narrative out of this in 8 episodes and it doesn't really quite work, limited to only 8 episodes so much subtlety and intricacy is lost and that which is there, is often poorly explained. I  blamed myself on my initial watch for often being confused at what was \r\nhappening but now after watching again while familiar with the source \r\nmaterial I don't feel the show really does a good job of setting up the \r\npolitical background and bounces from one extreme to another either name\r\n dumping with no context or flanderization such as Nilfgaard = Nazis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would never expect a Movie or Tv show to be able to capture or \r\nmatch everything from a book series where the only limit is the readers \r\nimagination but was very surprised how I much preferred nearly all the \r\nvoice acting and  visual aesthetics of the video games compared to the \r\nshow, from the creature design to the Nilfgaardian armour to the sense \r\nof character I think the games does it all better. The acting here \r\noverall isn't great, although I do like Cavil as Geralt. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall I still think the first season was decent and I did still \r\nenjoy it  and hopefully pretends better to come but can't say it \r\nparticularly succeeds either as an adaption of the first two witcher \r\nbooks or as a particularly well crafted piece of television.",

  "content": "A series to have a place for in your heart (27 September 2020)\r\n\r\nIt's not many series that age well. This did. My ratings for this series started around 6 or 7 and pushed their way through to almost perfect score. Is it objectively comparable to other 9's or 10's? I am not sure. Is it, subjectively? Hell yeah.\r\n\r\nI finished the series thinking that I will miss them all. You love the characters and you stay engaged no matter what. They all grow, they all feel and they all live the part. In this final season more than the rest, it is crystal clear that they love the show as well. They have their fun with it and that's something really precious for any viewer.\r\n\r\nThe show touches upon almost if not all the \"big\" hot sci-fi and science subjects. And it does so gracefully. Does it not have cheesy or \"no-sense\" parts? Well yeah it has, how could it not? But who cares? You learn to love even these small drivels as in the grant scheme of the show, they are even funny.\r\n\r\nThe simple truth is that they rocked it on. Both the actors from the first pilot, to anyone else than joined in the later seasons. This is not a masterpiece series and it doesn't need to be. This is not a filming/acting/etc. crew. It's a family. And I am happy to have spent time with them all. To their ups and their downs.\r\n\r\nYes, this is a review of a fan so it maybe doesn't ring as objective. But this show got from winning my respect to winning my love, keeping my excitement topped along 7 bloody years, making it difficult for me to write an objective piece. I couldn't have wished for anything different.\r\n\r\nIf you, reading this, haven't watched the series yet: do, you are in for a hell of a ride. If you, reading this, were a part of the people working for this series: thank you. Your work will stay with me along the years and that's something you should be proud of.",

Nowadays in American shows and Hollywood movies, we get lots of propaganda and political messages full of hatred and racism, where one specific race is showed bad and another one good, but in this show it's different. This show shows us that there are good people in every race and this show doesn't contain hate. It tells us that everyone is equal like it's supposed to be. So, I like this show very much and definitely deserves praise especially at this time when we get so many racist and hateful content from Holywood nowadays. This show focuses on postivity instead of negativity. It's about friendship and love. So, I highly recommend The Resident if you're into medical shows. You will love it.",

  "content": "At first I had no hope for any series that would be spawned by 343 industries that had to do with Halo. In my opinion 343 industries was the downfall of the Halo series. When Bungie left Microsoft and gave Halo over to 343 industries, they turned the entire series into something that was just bland and unfeeling. As much as I loved Master Chief and playing as Master Chief, the heart of Halo died the moment Bungie turned the reins over to someone else.\r\n\r\nSo what I say that I had no hope for the series when it came to TV is saying the least and most decent way I can say that I knew it was going to be a steaming pile of shit.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly though, the TV series really wasn't that bad. They skipped over some things, rushed a few things, and redefined a couple more but overall the series was as close to what Halo is that a TV series possibly could get.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPablo Schreiber was a good choice for Master Chief. At first I couldn't get past the fact that I knew him as pornstash from Orange is the New Black. But after about the second episode I found myself feeling like he was more Master Chief than the master chief I knew in the game. The way he talked and carried himself throughout the entire series was the exact way Master Chief does throughout the entire game series. Even down to the way he held his gun, Pablo was perfect.\r\n\r\nI particularly grew quite fond of Spartan 125 AKA Kai. From her pretty much picking up a warthog to taking on so many elites and standing up to the status quo, Kai was a badass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWas a little disappointed in how they changed Commander Keyes and Miranda Keyes characters so much. Other than that the actors that they got to play both parts were very good. The actress that they got to play Halsey was tremendous and I am really pleased that they brought Jen back to voice Cortana.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first Covenant you really see in this series is the elite. Now I think that their mouthpiece is a little smaller than what it is in the games but otherwise the elites looked brilliant.\r\n\r\n\r\nProphets they nailed those 100%.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd if you thought the Brutes were ugly in the game, wait till you see them in the TV show. And yes I still hate Brutes that much.\r\n\r\n\r\nJackels and grunts don't really make that make a huge appearance until the last episode but they were still done very well.\r\n\r\n\r\nSadly there's only one small scene with the hunters and basically all you see is their separate forms as worms and they are scattered and taking out all the Marines on a certain ship at Meekee's request.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you Didn't know Halo lore, you wouldn't have recognized the hunters at all you probably would have just brushed over it but I recognized it and I was like \"hey those are the hunters\".\r\n\r\nWe only see the Halo ring when MeeKee or Master Chief are touching the artifacts and it's only for a brief moments but if that's what's to come in future episodes (if there are future episodes), then I think the HALO series is in good hands. Wait, Let me correct myself there... I think the Halo TV series is in good hands cuz 343 can fuck right off.\r\n\r\nThere's only one other thing I can say that I didn't like about the HALO series and that was the fact that Master Chief kind of went off character and lost his virginity as Cortana watched. That was something none of us needed to see. But not a lot of skin was shown in that scene so we'll give it a pass just because it wasn't an extra long sex scene that we didn't need.\r\n\r\nOverall if you're a Halo fan, the TV series isn't that bad so give it a chance. We're not that far into the lore or the games so to speak that you couldn't see what you want to see from it .... there's so much more that's coming if they continue this series. We have Johnson to look forward to (hopefully), scarabs, the actual halo rings, the flood, and the forerunners. If they choose to continue the Halo TV series it could be huge. Let's just hope they decide to keep going...\r\n\r\nHope they finish the fight.",

  "content": "Dandadan is a manga and anime series that has been criticized for its repetitive formula, which is a common issue in long-running stories. Some fans have expressed their dislike for the series' constant sexual harassment from creatures, which they find gross. However, others have defended the series, stating that the sexual harassment is supposed to be bad and that the series has not run long enough to loop anything.\r\n\r\nThe formula used in Dandadan is not unique to the series, as many new battle shounens use a similar approach. However, what sets Dandadan apart is its execution and the quality associated with it. The series has been compared to other popular anime and manga series, such as Monogatari and One Piece, which also use formulas to move the plot forward.\r\n\r\nSome fans have argued that the formula used in Dandadan is not the problem, but rather how it is executed. They believe that the series has the potential to be engaging, but it needs to evolve and offer more depth as it goes on. The core of the series, which involves the main characters going on adventures and facing challenges, is formulaic, but it can be made more interesting by adding emotional complexity and moral ambiguity.\r\n\r\nOverall, the criticism of Dandadan's repetitive formula is not unique to the series, and many fans believe that it has the potential to be a great series if it can evolve and offer more depth. The series has been defended by some fans, who believe that the sexual harassment is supposed to be bad and that the series has not run long enough to loop anything.\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that the discussion around Dandadan's formula and its execution is ongoing, and opinions on the series vary widely. Some fans love the series and find it engaging, while others are critical of its formula and execution. Ultimately, whether or not Dandadan is a good series is a matter of personal opinion, and fans will continue to debate its merits.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Dandadan is a series that has been criticized for its repetitive formula, but it also has the potential to be a great series if it can evolve and offer more depth. The series has been defended by some fans, who believe that the sexual harassment is supposed to be bad and that the series has not run long enough to loop anything.

There were low expectations for the show, but it took off and made rock stars ut of the performers. \r\n\r\nNow Coronation Street has become more like U.S. soap operas. Some people say it is the influence of the newer soap operas like East Enders, with its screamfests. So now there is less humor, fewer long-term characters, and murder, murder, murder.\r\n\r\nSo if you try the current iteration of Coronation Street and find you don't like it plots or pacing, track down some of the older shows and give them a whirl.

In the interim he saw the buzzword \"liminal\" on a creepypasta forum and liberally shoehorned that in.  This is reflected in some ~retro, mildly anachronistic set design, props and IT-type things.

A more intimate, grounded version of a post-apocalyptic world that doesn't lack gory, violent action/horror sequences. Gustavo Santaolalla's score couldn't be a better fit.\r\n\r\nIf I was already excited to venture into the video game, now I can't wait for that day to come.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

I, like so many others, have been burned by horrid video game adaptations ***cough*** \"_Halo_\" ***cough***. I was incredibly surprised by the first episode. LOVED IT! While yes, the pacing was a bit slower than the game's first few moments, I felt like it was appropriate to set the stage for everything to come later. TLOU is one of my favorite games on the planet, and I am really hard to please when it comes to media. I am the definition of nit-picky when it comes to writing, production, and character development, especially with pre-existing and beloved material. I can say honestly, and without reservation that if the creators put as much attention to detail and fan-oriented storytelling into the later episodes of this season, this could easily be one of the best adaptations of a game, out there. I really can't wait to see what they do with it.",

But it is far from living up to its potential. And episode 3 has show us that it can really suck (no pun intended) at times.\r\n\r\nI am going to loosely address some reasons for why I think this show is disappointing and not as good as it could be:\r\n\r\n- Bad casting of main characters, unnecessary type-switching.\r\n\r\nThough I think that most of the actors are good, a lot of them and especially the main characters are not matching their counterparts from the game and the game (at least TLOU, Part I) just nailed it. The actors are good, but the casting choices still are just bad. Especially Ellie is just miscast all the way.\r\n\r\n- Bad chemistry between the characters.\r\n\r\nThere is no matching chemistry between the actors of Joel & Tess or Joel & Ellie.\r\n\r\n- Pointless deviations from the original story (see episode 3).\r\n\r\nThose deviations don't add anything good to the story, they are just annoying distraction at best and derailment at worst.\r\n\r\n- Sometimes just stupid, boring or pointless.\r\n\r\nThere is more examples than just the bigger part of episode 3 for that.\r\n\r\n- Mediocre storytelling.\r\n\r\nWhen it sticks to the main plot, it's not bad. But it's not really good either.\r\n\r\nAfter episode 3 I decided to take a break from watching the show and before I would continue to watch, I will wait till the whole season has aired and the reviews came in. If according to the non-shill and non-cheerleader reviews the show will give us more crap in the direction of episode 3, I'm out for good.",

  "content": "**TL;DR: If you're interested in watching this show because you heard there was time travel, don't.** That is about 1% about what this show is about, at least in the first season (that's as far as I've gotten). And even the time travel aspect is mystical, there is _no_ sci-fi element here.  _LOST_ it ain't.  If that changes past season one, well, I guess I might enjoy it more, but that's was my primary reason for giving the show a go, and my wife is enjoying this a lot more than I am.  Can't get enough of it. For me, it's pretty meh, and this is more of a warning for the guys than a proper review.\r\n\r\nThe show is 99% fish-out-of-water story of a feisty modern (well, from 1945 anyway) Englishwoman nurse , Claire Randall (played by Caitriona Balfe), who is sent back to 18th century Scotland by some mumbo-jumbo druidic magic after touching a runestone.  The theme is _heavy_ on a Harlequin-esque romance between the two leads, Claire and Jamie Fraser (played by Sam Heughan).  There's some fighting, almost as much boobies as Game of Thrones, and gore that may keep the guys interested, but this show is mostly going to appeal to women I think.\r\n\r\n(This may be a spoiler, but there is also a FAR too long drawn-out guy-on-guy homoerotic torture arc that I really hated.  And, aside from the lead, a lot of the men depicted are pretty horrible.)\r\n\r\nI think the historical costume-drama aspect of it is pretty interesting, I know a fair amount more about 18th century Scotland than I used to (which was pretty much nothing).  So, if you like that kind of stuff, you might like this.  Honestly though, I think having a POV of a modern woman kind of muddles the historical aspect a bit.  I liked Downton Abbey better if that helps (yes I know, different time period, but I think handled the period piece costume drama aspect better, even with all the soap opera tropes), so that may say something.",

  "content": "****From June to Offred: A 21st century slave tale!**\r\n\r\n**SEASON 01:****\r\n\r\nI was not sure to give it a try, in the end I just went on. The reason was, another dystopian theme. It was a short season with the 10 episodes, and I've got a mixed feeling. It was based on the 30 year old novel of the same name. I mean 3 decades old source is very old in the present trend. Since that book there were plenty of films, series were made similar to that theme, including one feature film adaptation. I don't know the screenplay was highly borrowed from its original source, but all I expected was alterable.\r\n\r\nEven though I felt familiarity, I enjoyed watching it. My issue was the drag. The whole season was a drag. Dragged to have one more season, or maybe more in the future. Especially I was very disappointed with the season finale. It only felt like a mid-season finale and yet a lot more to come in the same season. But that was only my assumption, this season ended at the halfway. They had held back too much to have some of it in the upcoming seasons. That's very intense move from the production perspective, but for the viewers, it left with unsatisfying.\r\n\r\nThe plus points were the casting and production. Elisabeth Moss was very good. Her expressions saved in parts of the earlier episodes. Particularly, her smile during those circus were going on, instead of being tensed and confused. That reveals the character, who wants to stay alive for a reason. As the story progresses in the next episodes, you would know more reasons why. Alexis' part was short, as well as many others. The overall the characters design was good. But I anticipated more from the story side to reveal.\r\n\r\nIn the near future, the humans had lost fertility capacity, excluding a very few men and women. Those who are capable of having babies are taken as slave surrogate mothers, after separating from their husbands and kids, to assign them those who desire to have children. This tale follows Offred, who is one of the maids. Her struggle against the couple who took her in, and overall society, how it treated her and others like her. The American dreams are gone. Many fled to Canada and yet some are trying to make it there. But Offred is not concerned about that. She now has to find her daughter before planning anything.\r\n\r\nEach epidoe was decent, but only a couple of them were top class. At least now we know what to expect from the follow-up season. Also the perspective of the story was very restricted like everything was from Offred. The episode like 'The Other Side' really made it interesting. We need more those kind of explanation of what's going on on the other side. Especially for a television series, they have all the time to detail out from all the angle. That's what I like in the series, otherwise I'm always a film fanatic, love to watch short and sweet tales. So I'm waiting for the season 2.\r\n\r\n_7/10_",

  "content": "Every now and then a production comes along that such an absolute gem, it has you lost for words.\r\n\r\nA Handmaids Tale, is based on the novel by Canadian author Margaret Atwood . I have not yet read the book but if this series is anything to go by, it will, I'm sure, make its way into my collection very soon.\r\n\r\nOn the surface the premise behind the series seems novel. Yet when you consider the fate of women in contemporary and historic theocratic societies, its not so far fetched. Indeed, what Atwood has rather cleverly done, is transplant aspects of life in theocratic societies, most notably Medieval Europe and Puritan colonial America, into a futuristic setting using civil war as a vehicle. A biological imperative is introduced too, in the form of pollution induced human sterility. Fertile women in Gilead (formerly the USA) are reduced to human incubators, their only imperative to produce children.\r\n\r\nOn face value, this might seem to be a story about the subjugation and commoditization of women. Indeed, it is that. Yet, what this series is ultimately about is the hypocrisy of intolerance. Not just women but any individual or group, who diverge from the rigid religious script, meet a grim fate. Meanwhile, those controlling the dialogue, are more or less free to make and break their own rules, as they see fit. Even those who do follow the societal script, often do so for reasons that are in opposition to those they claim to uphold.\r\n\r\nFor my money everything about this series is superb. Elizabeth Moss is a wonderful, off beat choice, for Offred the handmaid to a powerful commander, who is directly responsible for hers and others suffering. Joseph Fiennes, is capable in the role of the superficially charming but emotionally empty commander.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Yes a decent series but, for my money, its run on too long and now simply appears to be recycling the original script with a few twists and turns. At times, in my opinion, perilously close to looking like misandry, too. \r\n\r\nIn short, an engrossing, thoughtful and engaging series but it needs to come to a close, as it no longer has much more to say, that has not already been said.",

  "content": "This show was recommended to us by a relative. It was running on a treating service we had, so we started watching it. We liked it enough so that when our service suddenly stopped running The Good Wife we signed up for CBS All Access.\r\n\r\nWe have seen all seven seasons now and while I still liked it, the plots started to lag for me a bit in later seasons. Their professional relationships between different law firms or them personally kept changing, reminding me of the show Friends, where it felt like the main characters took turns dating each other.\r\n\r\nAnother element of the plots that struck me was the formula they seem sped to follow. They used a long running plot, usually political, that ran for entire seasons sometimes, and also had cases they handled that wrapped up in one show. Those cases often ran the same course: first one side would do well in court, then the other side would introduce something that helps them, and then the first side would — you get the idea. I called them reversals and got so I expected them every ten minutes or so for each show. Plus their investigators seemed really good at digging up dirt Fast. It isn’t a terrible thing. They only have 40+ minutes for each show and they want to cram drama in where they can. Perhaps I just noticed it more because I write novels and do a lot of plotting myself.\r\n\r\nBut we watched the entire seven seasons. I won’t be tempted to watch them again, but I don’t regret the time spent on them either. So now, before we give up CBS All Access, we need to try the sequel series, The Good Fig, and a show Alan Cumming is in that sounds good: Instinct.",

And by God, it looks amazing and has great direction. It is also a very feminine show, addressing traditionally feminine emotional themes and not focusing on masculine coded behaviours like strength, violence and glory, it's pretty cool to see an anime approaching fantasy from that mature untypical angle. A modern classic that will deservedly be in the top 10 anime of the 2020s.",

I couldn't wait for each new episode. Now, I watch it when it becomes available on a streaming service, and, on rare occasion you get a great episode, but it's not worth devoting a weekly schedule and sitting through all the fan-fiction episodes and story lines to get to the good stuff. The show can still be enjoyable, without question, though I find it better suited as background noise while doing work instead of must see TV that you're excited to tune in as it airs each week. It's now just another average sitcom which has been dumbed down for the masses quite considerably. At this rate, the show will probably end with Penny having Sheldon's child to fulfill the most commonly seen teenage fan-fiction.",

I don’t agree with another review I saw that said the show had slipped over time. Rather, it is a consistently great show, as all of Chuck Lorre’s efforts seem to be, sort of comedy’s answer to Aaron Sorkin’s dramas.\r\n\r\nMind you, I had some minor issues with it. I really got tired of Sheldon’s attitude and antics, but that 2as counterbalanced by the slow and careful ways he also showed character growth. Similarly, all of the characters exhibited realistic growth in their attitudes and behavior. The writing was usually strong, even during the few shows that I would classify as clunkers— plots that didn’t work for me. I am impressed that the show never jumped the shark, but rather stayed true to itself. Some long running shows can’t resist doing it, such as when Happy Days changed the Fonz from a cool dude to a combo superhero/cartoon character who could do almost anything, it seemed.\r\n\r\nFunny, I have a friend who told me she couldn’t watch it due to the canned laugh track, so I was amused to learn there was no laugh track as the show was filmed in front of a live audience.

Just to explain you how immoral it is:\r\n\r\nThere's a father who has one gay son, one lesbian daughter and one straight daughter. Gay son goes to his friend who turns out to be \"bi\" and will have sex with him. Turns out father of his friend is gay too and he also wants to have sex with this gay boy. Eventually they have sex. So basically, both son and father have sex with this gay boy. Also, his \"bi\" son will have sex with gay boy's sister too (the one who's straight). So, basically, he humps both sister and brother, while his dad humps brother only. That's how messed up and perverted is this show. And their third sibling is absolute lesbian. We also have other gay couples in this TV show, also have threesome and cuckold couples. And worse thing of all is that we're talking about school teenagers, not even adults. All of them are spoiled, rich kids, who only party, drink and smoke. There's zero plot and zero story. Also, sex scenes are way too much and there's a lot of gay sex in this TV show. It kinda feels like a soft version of gay porn. If you're straight and watching with family, you will feel very awkward watching it. Seems like this TV show was created by some horny gay teenager. I really hope it doesn't reflect reality of Spain's society, because all of these characters are disgusting rich, spoiled and immoral. There's not a single normal character in this perverted & garbage show. And Netflix keeps this low quality trash show alive, while real gems like \"The OA\" gets canceled.",

On par with more recent series like Battlestar 2004. \r\n\r\nFrom the top writers and directors of science fiction of that era, sophisticated storylines across the series deal with challenging topics that are risqué even today. Star Trek was radically ahead of its time in the 60’s having a multi-racial main cast including things like non-white character’s and women holding officer positions in Starfleet (unheard of at that time and for decades after)\r\n\r\nWarning: Some female characters wear mini-skirts (a fade in the 60’s).

It came across as a bad modern teen soap opera, that had hitched a ride with much older, martial arts franchise, from the 80's. \r\n\r\nSince then, I've been glad to have been proven \"partly\" wrong. Yes, it is a teen soap opera but enough of the original 80's Karate Kid films essence has rubbed off, making it moderately charming and watchable. Even to a wider, older audience. \r\n\r\nThe re-emergence of original characters I remember as a teen, watching the original films, held my attention. Season one to four, sensibly builds upon the formula that made the original films so watchable. \r\n\r\nSadly, season five is more preachy soap opera than karate action. The cheesy humour of the previous seasons, is mostly absent too.Indeed the tone is unsuitably lecturing and serious, which is, I feel a mistake. \r\n\r\nThis franchise, even in its dark moments never took itself too seriously. Nor should it, given what is essentially the larger than life, almost comic book vibe, the whole thing has going on. \r\n\r\nIn summary, season one to four is enjoyable. By contrast, season five seems to lack a clear sense of direction and worse still, doesn't seem to understand what it is, this franchise represents. I think maybe its time for this nostalgic joy ride, to get the \"chop.\"",

This happens indoor too, and NOBODY every says one thing about how inappropriate or dangerous that could be!  Empty beer bottles seems to be a near constant theme of the program, but throwing them at the students gets more frequent in later seasons. so the concept of this kind of adult behavior seems to be completely accepted by the writing team and the producers.\r\n\r\nThe story lines are still a little engrossing, but the ridiculousness of the writing just makes it too hard to actually like either the show or any of the characters - they all constantly shift from stupid to stupid AND evil to saint and then back again to stupid, and they do this repeatedly, sometimes several times in each episode.

That said, I can't say I feel quite so enthusiastic about Lashana Lynch's character, Bianca Pullman. She seems a bit lost, for want of a better description.I'm sure some will disagree. Idris Elba would, I feel, have been a perfect choice. Oh well....\r\n\r\nThe series itself is reasonable.  There's the usual espionage assassin thriller elements to keep you watching. \r\nFor anyone who read the book, such as myself and has seen the films from 73 and 97, (the latter's a loose adaptation) there's nothing really new on offer. \r\n\r\nBy contrast, for newcomers,  this may be a welcome and largely pleasant surprise. \r\n\r\nIn summary, a mostly decent series that's not really adding much that's new but may have enough on offer for those happy to revisit or newcomers, with no prior exposure.

So much so that I went on to watch The Wire.\r\n\r\nWhat I loved about the show is how it views the misery of drugs from different perspectives. In season 1 it focuses on the on-going battle between the street-corner dealers and the police; season 2 focuses on drug distribution; season 3 the possibility of a drug amnesty; season 4 and school kids and their choices between education, employment and drug dealers; season 5 the media take on drugs.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain feeling of helplessness running through this show, as you quickly realise that despite the extreme law enforcement the war on drugs is long gone. But because of the exceptionally good writing throughout you keep on hoping that something can be done to rid the city/state/country of this cancer.\r\n\r\nUnlike other drama shows, this feels so real even today, and one does wonder if governments and law enforcement departments are just peeing in the wind when it comes to winning the fight on drugs.",

  "content": "Twin Peaks delivers everything. It's a television show that delivers mystery, drama, comedy, suspense and weirdness in a way that only a handful of television programs have done. It might be the most effective 'mainstream' David Lynch vehicle of all time. The story is based in an alternate reality that parodies classic daytime soap-operas that had been popular during the nineteen-eighties. But it doesn't really parody them. More, it pays homage. The stereotypical characters mimic the same beats of actors appearing in shows like _Days of Our Lives_ or _As the World Turns_. \r\n\r\nDavid Lynch and Mark Frost show that they are masters of manipulating the emotions of the audience. _Twin Peaks_ delivers supernatural storylines and plot-devices with a flair that leaves the viewer confused and uncomfortable. It elicits feelings from its spectators. This is the mark of good quality media. It's what makes _Twin Peaks_ one of my favorite programs. \r\n\r\nThe characters are identifiable, intriguing and unforgettable. One of the biggest draws to Twin Peaks is their character development. This isn't just a story about a girl that is killed and wrapped in plastic. No. This is a collection of various stories that weave around one and other. From our friend Sheriff Harry Truman and his relationship to Josie. To the adventures of Audrey Horn, Super Sleuth. To the exploits of Bobby, Shelly and the comatose Leo Johnson.\r\n\r\nBut the most unforgettable character is our central one. The hero, FBI Agent Dale Cooper. A role perfectly played by Kyle MacLachlan. He also happens to the the main character. The focus. Agent Cooper has been assigned to the Laura Palmer murder case in the small town of Twin Peaks. His introduction to the town mimics our own in an strangely positive light. This makes Agent Cooper a perfect host to an otherwise depressing feature. His uplifting nature is infectious not only to the story but also to the audience. I can also identify with his notorious love of Cherry Pie and Coffee. \r\n\r\nTo say that the storyline meanders is a bit of an understatement. The overarching story is about a small-town girl that was murdered by an unknown killer. The FBI had been brought in to investigate, but that is where things go awry. We get Aliens, Logs, Supernatural Events, Possessions, Incest, Betrayal, Physical Transformations, Teleportation, Alternate Realities and The Yakuza all presented in a bizarre way that still leaves you wanting more. To make things even more enticing. I like to think of this world not only being expanded out into the Revival show on Showtime (2017) or the film, _Fire Walk With Me_ but also an extension of Lynch's film _Lost Highway_.\r\n\r\nThe weirdness is what makes Twin Peaks so memorable. When David Lynch is involved, it's not just frivolous silliness. Everything is a metaphor. For the most part. I think. Maybe. This weirdness carries the show into some really dark and scary places. That again is something that makes the series so gripping.\r\n\r\nIf you're a fan of David Lynch's work then this is perfect for you. If you're a film student. If you're a fan of gripping television. Watch _Twin Peaks_! It gets weird, but that's just par for course. Some people have criticized the show for going too far off the rails. It had been viewed as boring too. But its a show for people that really want to sit down and enjoy something. It's not a Michael Bay produced explosion picture and that might turn off a good deal of typical viewers. Stick with it and you will get stories presented in a world that has genius elements of noir, horror and drama.",

It has been the catalyst for so many careers, e.g. Eddie Murphy, Bill Murray, Will Ferrell  etc... The show has definitely had its ups and downs but, in taking a step back it is evident that the show has remained consistently mixed in it entire run. \r\n\r\nNot every season has had great writers or talent, some actors have been much more successful than others, and yet it has always found an audience. My favourite era of the show was the mid 2000s with Bill Hader and Andy Samberg, but most people have a a preference for whatever season they had as a teenager. The consistency of structure and crew unites all the different casts, creating a familiar image and sensibility, found in every season.\r\n\r\nThere will always be a host monologue, musical guest, Weekend Update and most importantly, it will always be LIVE! The production process of a pitch meeting with the host, staying up all night on Tuesdays to write, read-through and dress rehearsal. Whether it's 1975 or 2023, everyone endures the same experience (although whether they have the aid of cocaine is certainly a difference!). \r\n\r\nThe argument SNL hasnt been funny since the \"insert previous ten years\" is redundant. Every season of the show has been criticised for not being funny but every season of the show has produced hilarious sketches and shone a light on the new faces of comedy. In the 70s they had Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi, the 80s they had Julia Louis Dreyfus and Conan O'Brien, the 90s they had Will Ferrell and Eddy Murphy, the 2000s Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, the 2010s Kate McKinnon and Vanessa Bayer and finally in the 2020s we have Bowen Yang and Marcello Hernandez. \r\n\r\nThe show continues to inspire and entertain the next generation of aspiring creatives with it's ground approach to sketch comedy. It is an American institution that will always hold a very dear place in my heart.",

From the get go its focus is his wholly unlikable son, who has taken a job as a bell hop in New York. An employment decision that makes little sense, given his flat, anti social, lone wolf personality, well established in the first spin off.\r\n\r\nWhat makes even less sense, is Dexter simply being let off the hook by a cop who went out of her way, to pursue and finally catch him. Instead of convicting him, she sends him a postcard explaining how she's somehow even with him and he's essentially free to go on being a serial killer. Sounds like the sort of thing a cop would say, right?\r\n\r\nIn short, this is another dismal, implausible script that's inhabiting the skin suit of the vastly superior, original series. Its woke too, topping off the rank stink of decomposition, emanating from the would be Dexter franchise.\r\n\r\nIn summary, some things are best left alone, for fear of making a mockery, of past success.

Back then I adored the first 4 seasons, while dismissing season 5 outright, and only having a grudging respect for seasons 6 & 7. But these days I much prefer 6&7 over 1, 3 and 4. No idea why but there you go!\r\n\r\nAs for the acting, well other than Martin Sheen, Rob Lowe and John Spencer the first few seasons were a cast of relative unknowns, but come the middle of S1 it doesn't matter because the likes of Alison Janey's CJ, Bradley Whitford's wonderful Josh Lyman and Richard Schiff's brooding Toby Ziegler play their roles exceptionally well.\r\n\r\nOf course the greatest aspect of this show is the writing, especially for the first four seasons when Aaron Sorkin was directly involved. And even after he left under a cloud the writing for season 5 and beyond was still very good, if a little uneven.\r\n\r\nIt has been awhile since I last picked up on this show.

  "content": "If every program on TV was this good I'd never leave the house.\r\n\r\nI have to agree with the reviewers who call this the best drama show ever, at least for entertainment value. Of course, it gets panned often for political reasons by people who perhaps don't watch it enough to see that, yes, it is a liberal administration being represented here, but they often make mistakes and fail in their efforts, so it is hardly a progressive utopia. \r\n\r\nI write novels in my spare tome, and I like to think my dialogue is a strong point, so I have nothing but admiration for the fast and witty conversations in this show. You may literally have to watch the series a second time to catch everything thrown at you in their quick back and forth banter, often delivered as they pace around the West Wing set. But that is no hardship either. Much has been made about Aaron Sorkin's departure from the show, and perhaps there was a slight drop in quality because of it, but it was still well worth watching. It was so good, the new kids couldn't break it.",

  "content": "The first edition, indeed season, of this political drama is as good as it gets. Aaron Sorkin has created a monster - in just about every sense - and the cast led by Martin Sheen (\"President Bartlet\") consistently deliver well as the senior advisors in his administration - alongside some sadly infrequent appearances from his no-nonsense wife (Stockard Channing) - guide us through the daily trials and tribulations accompanying American government. For the most part, the pace is hectic, controlled (sometimes) by the calming, sagacious influence of his Chief of Staff \"Leo\" (John Spencer) and deals with just about every sort of scenario - domestic, foreign, familial and collegiate that comes across the paths of the Director of Communications (Richard Schiff), his deputy (Rob Lowe), the Press Secretary (Allison Janney) as well as \"Josh Lyman\" (Bradley Whitford) - the passionate but occasional liability that is the deputy Chief of Staff. Sorkin and the cast manage, effortlessly, to create a series of scenarios that reminded me of both \"Yes, Minister\" and the original (British) \"House of Cards\" - comedy and humour expertly mixed with politicking on a grand, yet personal, scale. Nothing is off limits insofar as the subjects covered and it presents as authentic a depiction of government as we are ever likely to see. Personally, I though Stockard Channing added loads to this as the First Lady and Janney and Spencer's characters gave me hope that maybe, just maybe, someone in there knew what the hell was going on. Of course it takes an hugely American perspective on things, which as a non-American grated a bit on occasion with an intermingling of fact and fiction that sometimes compromised the integrity of the stories; but in the main it is one hell of a watch. Unfortunately, around about the start of series four, the writing starts to slide and the cast - fresh and vibrant at the beginning of the run - begin to take too great a role behind the camera; the plots become too personal (even romantic) and far-fetched. The original stars feature a bit less and it loses much of it's potency and it's plausibility. Certainly, the last two series which focus on presidential succession and sidelined many of the cast we had followed since day one left me cold and disinterested. By the conclusion I felt there had been maybe two series too many... At it's best, it is great, thought-provoking, entertainment though and well worth binging on.",

  "content": "Pepa the Pig for Adult Liberals. Or maybe, \"Mickey Mouse Takes Office.\" I can't decide.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I'm hyper sensitive, having been what equates to an American liberal for most of my life (I'm Danish, and here being liberal puts you on the right, but I've been a lefty for more than forty years), but trying to watch this show instantly fatigues me. Not because of the acting, which is above average, the dialog, which is well-written if overly verbose, not even the stories, which seem implausible but entertaining, and this IS fiction, so you need to allow for unrealistic and entertaining things happening 24/7. Otherwise it'd get boring.\r\n\r\nNo, what drains my energy is the way it treats me as a mental toddler. It's the way the resentment for people with opposing views (conservatives, religious people, etc.) is matched only by the self-righteousness and the conviction of having the moral high ground and superior intelligence. The ease with which people are divided into moral and immoral boxes based on their religious views, political affiliation, or even demography. And isn't it nice, because we all agree that religious zealots are terrible, right? That conservatives are immoral, right? That Texans are stupid, right? Lucky we have our club, where we're educated, virtuous and bearers of The Right Morals™. \r\n\r\nEpisode one present a religiously based conflict that is so overly constructed that it borders on pathetic (hence my Pepa the Pig reference). The conflict is resolved not through discussion or discourse, but by president Mickey Mouse turning up and revealing how the religious group is in cahoots with people sending his twelve-year-old daughter a death threat in the form of basically a voodoo doll. How convenient. Such lazy writing. I wonder how a diplomatic person with some deep rhetorical skills might have solved that conflict in lieu of one side basically declaring moral bankruptcy. I don't know, maybe some kind of political figure, like a head of state or something. Guess that's for another show. This show has trumpets blaring instead, while the camera pans across our great imaginary president Highground. \r\n\r\nJust for the record, even though my father was a priest and I was raised Christian, today I think religion is garbage and I've been an atheist for about 25 years. But that's my opinion and it says nothing about my moral values, and what anyone else believes doesn't either. I just don't appreciate this lazy and presumptuous \"religious conservative therefore bad, amirite?\" fallacy. \r\n\r\nI quit at the beginning of episode two, when President Mouse basically says they didn't lose Texas in the primaries because of a joke about cowboy hats, but because Texans are stupid, or \"when the president learned Latin,\" as it puts it. One has to wonder if the writers just don't care about alienating an entire state of potential viewers, or if they think Texans are so stupid they didn't catch that insult. Either way, the club that you're supposed to be in to be able to watch something like this and think it's okay to disrespect your opponent's intelligence and points of view in this manner is not one I want to be a member of. Not anymore. \r\n\r\nI'm done with this restrictive and divisive club of supposedly morally superior intelligencia, with the undercurrent of resentment and obnoxious entitlement. I'm sick and tired of having echo chamber \"discussions\" where you constantly fear stepping out of line lest you be called a bigot, or a racist, or a misogynist, or a Nazi, or whatever is the most efficient card you can use to shut down even the slightest sign of dissent from the implicit party line. \r\n\r\nAnd yes, as I said, I'm probably hyper sensitive because this to me is such a large problem right now, but that's why I can't watch this. I'm surprised a show from 1999 is this blatantly and unapologetically biased, but maybe that's because I've been liberal myself all that time and it just seemed okay. I mean, the religious and conservatives ARE wrong, and mostly idiots, right? To my religious and conservative friends who watch this and get rightfully offended, from a former liberal who thought this was okay, even truth, and behalf of my other liberal friends who still think like this but aren't bad people, I apologize. \r\n\r\nAnd think of it like this: With shows like these being made, and much worse media content being released currently,  some people, like me, get increasingly turned off by the divisiveness and implicit brainwashing, to the point where they simply stop being liberals. I don't know what I'm gonna vote next time, but it won't be left. If I were American, I wouldn't vote Democrat. But then, there'd have to be a candidate other than Trump, because I don't think that guy has America's interests at heart, only his own.",

The central focus of season 1 is a murder mystery.

  "content": "Pleasantly surprised by the first episode *Spoilers*\r\n\r\nAs a fan of Cornwell's Warrior Chronicles/Saxon Stories I've been looking forward to this series for quite some time. Mentally prepared for a major disappointment I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't read the novels the story of Uhtred unfolds fast, perhaps too fast. This first episode covers more than half of the first novel. Although a lot has been omitted, many of the aspects that make the novel such a pleasure to read are there, but (very) subtle. \r\nIf you have read the novel you have to accept that many events concerning Uhtred of Bebbanburg and his character traits are only touched upon or skipped: his loathing for his father, his fascination for the religion of his forefathers, his contempt (or rather boredom) for Christianity, the stories the blacksmith tells him, Beocca's attempts to teach him to read, his first encounter with an adulterous Alfred (the not so Great yet), his admiration for the Romans, his growing love for Ragnar and Ragnar's family, his arrogance and big mouth, his humor and much more. I would have loved to have been able to watch at least four episodes in which of all of the above is featured but that is not going to happen.\r\n\r\nThen why did I like it so much?\r\nI have to admit I'm a sucker for guys with long hair and pretty faces, but besides that, the episode had enough to offer: Uhtred's Christian/Saxon upbringing and his pagan beliefs are represented by his two necklaces: the amber stone and Thor's hammer. I hope Uhtred's internal struggle will be featured more prominently in the episodes to come. A baptism scene in which Beocca could easily have drowned Uhtred making an end to the series after only half an episode. Young Uhtred is a smart-mouthed little brat (like when he is trying to get his way with Beocca). Young as he is, he is the ealdorman of Bebbanburg and is willing to die for it. He is doesn't think first but acts, and so we see a child going to war and attacking a Danish warlord. We are treated to the sight of a massive shield-wall in which it becomes clear that there is almost no space to move and that movement is slow. If you die, you become an obstacle that your fellow comrade-in-arms have to be beware of or else they will fall too. (Even after two viewings still a bit surprised that Lord Uhtred (Matthew MacFadyen) stepped through the shield-wall so easily. I must have missed the Danes letting him through.) Thyra is mentally broken after the awful hall-burning, and not just by Sven. Could Uhtred have saved her? It seems Thyra expected him to. Ubba, though a great Danish leader, and despite having humor, is very cautious and heavily depends on the signs the gods send him, making him very unpredictable, according to Ravn, earl Raganar's father. Brida is portrayed as a strong young woman, more Dane than Saxon. But above all, I liked Uhtred. I liked the way he looks and moves. I did miss his humor but I have hopes that we will be treated to that in the next episodes. He was powerless during the hall-burning, and devastated by the deaths of Ragnar and his family. For now, he is still a boy. Can't wait for him to become a man.\r\n\r\n\"Wyrd bið ful ãræd\"",

  "content": "**Great, but could be better and decreases in quality in season 4.**\r\n\r\nI am writing this review after having watched season 4. I have binge watched this TV show and loved it overall, but I was disappointed of how the show decreased in quality in season 4.\r\n\r\nOne reason for that decline might be that the former showrunner and head writer Stephen Butchard quit as the head writer after season 3. Another one might be that a central character of the seasons 1-3 died at the end of season 3 - resulting in a major shift for all the other characters and especially for the main protagonist of the show.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for the decrease in quality seems to be that it becomes more unrealistic, inconsistent and carricaturistic in season 4 than it already was to some extent in the seasons before.\r\n\r\nTo give some examples: I simply hate it when stupid stuff is presented, like kings (or even queens) unnecessarily throwing themselves into the frontlines of battles and thus stupidly (and out of character) putting the whole kindgom under unnecessary risk (as it is very destabilizing for a kindom when a king unexpectedly dies and finding a good successor who is capable of keeping peace and order is difficult and takes time). It may be important if the king is present at the battlefield, but it's ridiculous when they are fighting in the frontlines, they are too valuable to do such things and when they do, it should mean something and not just happen on a regular basis. Especially, since it is established in the show that sudden death in the battlefield frontlines is a likely thing to happen even for the most capable fighters.\r\n\r\nOr, I hate it when characters do stupid stunts which would get them killed in no time in real life (like running through a shield wall alone and then finding themselves fighting alone surrounded by enemies). I don't mind in general when characters do stunts like that, but it should be consistent in terms of world-building and it should be explained how the characters can do such things without wearing plot armor and for example without enemy fighters who are surrounding them just standing there, doing nothing and just waiting for their turn to be attacked for no good reason.\r\n\r\nSo, it has always been a problem in the show that such stupid stuff happens. But season 4 took that to a new level and I hated it. Especially when we are looking at the character of Brida for example - she is transformed into an inhuman monstrocity regarding her capabilities and her motivations, therefore I can't take anything that happens with her seriously anymore.\r\n\r\nThis review is more a rant about season 4 than it is a balanced and complete review of the whole show. So let let me give an overall review with this short summary: it is or at least was a great show and seasons 1-3 would deserve to rightfully be given 8 or 9 stars out of 10, but right now after season 4 it is just a 7/10. The show is still good and it has the advantage that it is based on an already finished book series of 13 titles (2 book titles resulting in 1 season each, so there are probably 3 or 4 seasons more to come if the show remains successful) - so that it probably won't get much worse than season 4 as the new authors don't have to come up with a plot from scratch and thus will be able to hold some level of quality thanks to the already existing books. But I really hope that it gets better than that again, just as it was in seasons 1-3.",

That said this isn't aiming to be Oppenheimer.\r\n\r\nMost of all this show is simply great fun, highly recommended if you are a fan of the game or never played it.",

I loved this season from beginning to the end, and will watch again and continue to watch future seasons (which is guaranteed at this point due to its critical success and that they've just secured 25 million from the California government to make the next season in the state) just as I've played the games over and over again (and will do so until Bethesda releases a new Fallout game).",

This fits into the franchise as much as any other entry as a standalone series, and has an attention to detail and epic scale, big budget, and high energy that not many works can seem to capture when they go to screen in today's industry. I, for one, am glad this exists. Totally delivered every bit of retro-futuristic dystopian survival drama I needed.",

My view is purely based on these eight episodes of mess.\r\n\r\nWhere to begin? Well, the first episode was boring, but I stayed with the hope that something nice would happen. I wasn’t wrong, as episodes 2 and 3 were really good. They started introducing new characters and developed their personalities. Unfortunately, after that, the writers' and directors' weaknesses started showing up as the story feels really illogical and disjointed.\r\n\r\nBad acting, unnecessary and illogical fights. Need not to mention, I hate this new Hollywood trend (especially Marvel) where they play 1960s music and show fight scenes in slow motion. You can like it for once or twice, but this crap has been shoved down the throat in every movie these days. This series was nauseatingly full of such scenes.\r\n\r\nThe storyline is so weak, no one knows why people are doing something? The Garfield-eyed protagonist is very annoying and stupid. She is supposed to be looking for her father, but meanwhile, she seems bubbly and cheerful, literally asking someone to have sex with her, unnecessarily spying on a vault people… why???\r\n\r\nAs if this was not enough, the series gets worse from episode 4 onwards. But this time all the nuts and bolts of this stupid series start coming off, and no one knows what’s happening. They tried to show unnecessary gore, violence, and disgust to give “shock treatment” to their viewers and get some attention, but after some time, even that feels annoying and boring.\r\n\r\nI give it 3/10.\r\n\r\nP.S. My friend is not responding to my texts. He knows what he did. He is so done!",

Truly this would have been the end the show deserved had this been the final episode.\r\n\r\nApparently it was written as such until the show was renewed BUT with most of the cast moving on contractually already! Yes, a wrap around\\ tag on scene\\tale opens the show up to an all new reset of the beginning, only with a now adult Henry being approached by his unknown to him daughter (about the same age Henry was when he found Emma in ep 1 season 1)! She says he must go with her cause \"his family needs him\". Sound familiar? It would seem Henry, like Emma in that ep, is clueless and so another forgetting spell was cast. Or whatever!\r\n\r\nFor those who do not know, the next season will no longer have the following characters\\actors: Emma Swan, Snow White, Prince Charming, Belle, young Henry, and I am sure I am forgetting one other. The core will be the now adult Henry, Hook, Gold, and the evil queen\\not evil anymore.\r\n\r\nHow the show intends to carry on or explain where everyone missing has gone (yes there was a time jump in the tag on scene of several years) will be interesting to see, but I frankly have little hope for the continued success of the show. It was all about Emma, Snow, Charming, and how everything revolved around them. Without those characters I think it will be a rebooted show trying to be it's old self but simply unable to.\r\n\r\nI mean everyone is together, happy, sitting down to a thanksgiving like meal in this ep's natural end! Somehow along the way all that is torn apart? Is the ultimate lesson learned to be that there are no happy endings or happy beginnings because even in a fantasy world life sucks? Crap happens to the best of people regardless of what they have overcome to get to a place of stability?\r\n\r\nThis should have been the end; a fitting finale.",

Enter a roughneck, \"Sgt. Kameyama,\" kicked out of his precinct to \"Special Missions,\" a two-man office.

  "content": "Many weeks back I heard this show discussed on a TV segment of my local radio network (ABC Local in Australia, on the Nightlife programme) and that featured an audio clip of a scene from the series concerning the making of a film about zombies with an ‘interesting’ method of spreading their contagion. Oddly, once I started watching the series, that episode wouldn’t drop until many weeks later, so I’m not sure how the radio show got such an advanced, unaired episode. Anyway, the show seemed like it would be fun and I somehow got a free trial of Apple TV for a few months (maybe via spending a certain amount on an Apple gift card or something...$30, say), so I made a point of watching it. \r\n\r\n From the first episode, the series has the feel of an old style screwball comedy (not really a genre that I’m familiar with and looking up that term, it only partially matches what I’m thinking of here, things like a highly stylised manner of speaking between characters). Seth Rogen plays Matt Remick, a senior figure in the fictional Hollywood film corporation Continental Studios...who also happens to be a man-child. He is about to become the head of this studio and discover that the reality of his promotion won’t meet his expectation of how he imagines it will be. It seems he will be internally conflicted between his love of cinema as an art form and the pressure to make a tonne of money for the corporation. \r\n\r\n The main cast really only serve to illuminate different facets of Remick, as in they don’t seem fully formed characters with personalities of their own, as happens in such great sitcoms as Seinfeld, Cheers, Yes Minister or Fawlty Towers, to name some of the best. Perhaps that could be construed as a reflection of the 'type' that populate these positions in this industry...or the show's writing isn't as sharp when it comes to characters other than Remick? They are perky and hyper but lack depth. Like Gervais’ The Office, this is very much cringe comedy, with Remick being the focus of that. It works. In my notes I did write some quotes from the show which I liked, such as Remick saying “I got into all this ‘cause, you know, I love movies but now I have this fear that my job is to ruin them” (episode 1). Episode 2 has one character illuminate a facet of Remick by saying of him “His film boner is at full mast”. The language does get stronger in this series, so if such language offends you, it would be best to give this series a miss (there is also one raunchy sex scene in the first series). In the same episode, I got a laugh when Remick says “I’m trying to support women”. Of course, the humour here derives from his weird way of demonstrating that. \r\n\r\n A feature of this series is that famous industry figures have roles here. Now, some names I was familiar with but would struggle to identify them in a police lineup...I’d have better luck if I had a multiple choice option to pick them...for example, someone like Martin Scorsese. However, there were many industry figures that I was not familiar with, as I haven’t lived and breathed films for a while now. Personally, it would have been funny to me if the joke was that the series used actors to play actual industry figures, as I wouldn’t have known that in any case...or that the person really existed anyway. In any case, I had no trouble recognising Ron Howard when he appeared. All these famous/’famous’ people play versions of themselves, for comedic effect, obviously. \r\n\r\n Going on my notes for the series, here are some comments about the episodes that prompted me to write something down:\r\n\r\nEpisode 1, “The promotion”  – very well constructed with a nice payoff. It has Martin Scorsese in it. Remick digs holes for himself and tries digging his way out of them. It would be interesting to know how much the series draws on actual practice in the industry versus drawing on real world events. For instance, a part of this episode reminded me of the news story where people with damaging claims against Donald Trump had their story bought by magazines like the National Enquirer and the US Weekly in order to ‘bury’ them...the term “catch-and-kill” was used in that case. In other words, the magazines did Trump a favour in order to help him get elected as president. \r\n\r\nEpisode 2, “The oner”  – I’ve already included a couple of quotes from this one but I did note that a figure of $800,000 was mentioned as the price to use a Rolling Stones song in a film. Is that about right?\r\n\r\nEpisode 3, “The note” – I was amused when one character says of Ron Howard’s film “He should not be burdening audiences with his catharsis. Go to therapy, save us 45 minutes of fucking runtime”. The scene where Howard has an outburst at the poster art for the film meeting...I thought that was a ruse by him to get the film to Patty instead of Continental. In any case, tongue planted firmly in cheek, perhaps, I’d say that the episode should have ended at that scene! \r\n\r\nEpisode 4, “The missing reel” – Shot in a film noir style. At the time I felt that this was the weakest episode. It became funnier once the mystery had been resolved. \r\n\r\nEpisode 6, “The paediatric oncologist”  – I think that this is the worst episode of the first series. The portrayal of the doctors as that petty didn’t strike me as being plausible...they’re sitcom doctors...and I wasn’t having much fun with them. \r\n\r\nEpisode 8, “The Golden Globes”  – I started cringing when Zöe Kravitz’ character (herself) approached Remick when he was behind the scenes, trying to get credit for her film. However, they managed to turn things around quickly and it became an amusing scene (I have a low cringe tolerance or something). This moment isn’t unlike Gervais’ sitcom/mockumentary The office. \r\n\r\nEpisodes 9 and 10 – I couldn’t get past how the supposedly stoned characters didn’t really strike me as being stoned...that might just be a good thing...was I expecting them to go all ‘method’ for their roles? \r\n\r\n Anyway, this is my first experience, really, of “streaming” TV, from memory. One thing which REALLY annoyed me was how the closing credits were shrunk and moved to a corner to make way for a promotion for something else on Apple TV. I’d repeatedly fight the screen to leave the closing credits on full screen so that I could read them! The start of each episode also starts with a promotion for another programme on Apple TV, which you can skip, it seems, thankfully. \r\n\r\n Paying to watch TV isn’t really my thing so no doubt I’ll cancel my subscription just before my free trial expires. Can’t say that I’m desperate to continue further series of The studio. Hopefully it’s not one of those traditional TV network type of shows where they just keep it going and going...and going and going...until it just dies a belated death...like the US Office? Gervais’ had the better concept of how long to keep a series going. \r\n\r\n For my score for this first series, I was thinking of giving it 75+%, which would mean giving it 8/10 stars here. Think I’ll drop the + in my score, which means, since I don’t round up, a score of 7/10 stars here. I was entertained by this series and if you closely follow the Hollywood scene you will no doubt get a lot more from this series, as you see real people that you follow play strange versions of themselves.",

This series suffers the post millennial habit of taking itself far too seriously ( think of the Daniel Craig Bond films) to the point that it becomes a chore to watch.\r\n\r\nThe 1973 movie starring Yul Brynner and Richard Benjamin got everything right. Keep it simple, keep it fun. That way lies a far more rewarding viewing experience.",

  "content": "This show is a sort of what-if:  what if highly advanced robots were developed, ostensibly to populate a theme park?  Different characters react according to their personalities.   To Dr. Ford  (Sir Anthony Hopkins), who keeps a copy of Michelangelo's CREATION OF ADAM in his office, it is the creation of a new species.  To Bernard Lowe, it is a fascinating experiment to take his mind off personal tragedy.  To the pompous writer Sizemore, it is a new artform as he composes narratives for the robots to carry out.  To visitors William and Logan it is wish-fulfillment, whether it is William's search for love or Logan's vulgar thrill-seeking.  To Theresa, it is just a business, and she complains that Dr. Ford's attempts to making robots more lifelike and unpredictable will eat into profits.   The robots themselves, who are supposedly rebooted after each \"show\", aren't supposed to think or feel anything -- but they are starting to do so. \r\n\r\nThe show has numerous artistic references -- Dr. Ford's Michelangelo painting, the logo parodying Da Vinci's \"Vitruvian Man\" drawing,  Debussy's REVERIE, plus references to old-fashioned Westerns.\r\n\r\nIt is refreshing to see a show where there is attention paid to character and ideas as well as action.",

Westworld is one of HBO's biggest/best series, and in my opinion, it's the one that currently occupies the throne that GOT ruled for years. Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy created an extremely complex narrative, filled with mind-blowing twists, and truly remarkable character-building. Season three promised to be totally different, having in mind last season's game-changing finale, so expectations are undoubtedly very high...\r\n\r\nWhile it's true that Westworld packs jaw-dropping twists, the previous seasons differ from one another concerning this aspect. In season one, the twists serve the story, but in the second one, it felt like the story was serving the twists. This resulted in a few \"less great\" episodes due to the loss of tension and of well-balanced pacing, occasionally losing the interest of its viewers. In addition to this, most twists were so foreshadowed that the last few episodes lacked that powerful punch to knock us out.\r\n\r\nSeason three goes back to basics. Last season's finale works almost like a reboot of the series regarding its environment, rules, and even characters. Most of the series is set in the real world so far, but there are a few sequences in familiar places. Dolores' plan seems simple, but since this is Westworld, the last half of the season will probably provide a few surprises, so keep your eyes wide open.\r\n\r\nI can't really delve into what each character is doing, but according to the trailers, writing that Bernard and Maeve have an essential role in this season shouldn't come as a shock. Both possess two very intriguing arcs, and I'm definitely interested in knowing how they will connect to Dolores' storyline. Aaron Paul's Caleb doesn't have that much screentime in the first four episodes. Nevertheless, he receives a well-written backstory, and his subplot not only tells the audience everything about him, but it also shows how the real world works.\r\n\r\nMy biggest compliment to the first half of this season is about each episode's structure. Every single episode starts and ends with something impactful. Each time I started one, I was instantly captivated by what was happening, and every ending left me with an extreme curiosity to watch the next one. Fortunately, I had the \"next episode\" button, but it will definitely be interesting to see how fans will react to weeks of waiting for the next (great) episode. Throughout each chapter, the story flows naturally without those confusing, exaggerated, twistful narratives of season two.\r\n\r\nSo far, it's a pretty straightforward main plot, but the unsolved mysteries still carry that aura of unpredictability, which makes season three a perfect structure to deliver a phenomenal, shocking finale. The acting continues to be top-notch with everyone just giving their all. So far, my standouts are Tessa Thompson (Charlotte Hale) and Evan Rachel Wood. Ed Harris (William) also delivers an outstanding display, but the two women are unbelievably good, especially Thompson. Technically, the episodes were still a work in progress, but the production and visual quality of HBO are impressive as always.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Westworld returns with a perfect season's structure to blow every fan's mind away once again. The real world looks incredible, every character gets a very intriguing story, but the first and last few minutes of each episode are absolutely fantastic. Each chapter instantly grabs the viewer's attention, and the ending leaves everyone craving for the next episode. Tessa Thompson is the absolute standout, but Evan Rachel Wood continues to prove her impressive acting skills. Aaron Paul should have more screentime in the last half of the season, but so far, both he and Caleb are pretty great. Excellent pacing, brilliant tension-building regarding the central mystery, and wonderfully-written dialogues. Four episodes, nothing truly negative to point out. Hoping for a second-half as great or better than the first.",

Great acting by all of the cast but foremost Ulrich Thomsen who gave me the creeps, not only once. Kai Proctor is the hateable character with a hardcore religious background and Kurt Bunker (an excellent Tom Pelphrey) is the likeable character with a Nazi/Rightwing background.

  "content": "Includes Spoilers.\r\n\r\n**Cons:**\r\n\r\n- The by far biggest problem for me with this series: The writers had the chance to create a fair and equal alternative timeline based on more women in the space race to the moon. What they created is a lazy ripoff from our timeline but just more women in leading position with more space races things and even more capitalism. These women usually earn these positions and we follow them on their paths through the episodes/years but it's just boring fillers. I don't care why they got their posiition if they play a good character which makes sense. This feminisim and forcing a black women and even more people of color into the series to create achievements instead of distributing it more equal feels very forced. Trying to create an unncessary conflict and also depicting it in the series \"old white man vs strong women\". It's lazy, it's boring, it doesn't add to the bigger story. But see my next point, if you see the none advertised story as the main you don't yet let down.  \r\n- The space race is just the timeline which we follow. The character drama: lesbians, divorces, new marriages, cheating, thinking about cheating, problems with drugs and much more is the main plot. And you should be in for it, there are whole episodes only that. The Space Race(s) could have been 1 season and that's it. \r\n- The Diplomaty parts which could be very interesting are also mostly forced. As the story still kinda follows an ongoing cold war there are even aggressions on both sides but even when both US and UDSSR are killing people from the other side, the concflict isn't played out well. I would have liked to see much more Propaganda, courts, also other nations getting into the conflict aswell. Only 3 sentences about United Nations in season 2, thats it. Also ESA 0 words.\r\n- Some very basic Space Rules just got ignored to create more drama/plot. Allowing fire in a pressurized capsule/station, allowing fire weapons anywhere on the space crafts/stations, not checking the logistics for contraband items before shipping. That's things NASA would not in our nor any other similar timeline allow.\r\n- To create plot on the moon, no future US Astronauts get trained on Russion and vice versa to keep tension in Lost of Words scenarios. Also only the Russians learn a little bit of english until Season 3 (40 years of timeline) the smart Americans not one word. \r\n- As major parts of the series are in space and on the moon, the gravitational problem in filming such a series becomes pretty obvious in most of these shots. They only really cared for it when demonstrating it for a training video inside the story and on most of the walking on the moon scenes. \r\n- Using LAM to do transport flights for material aswell as people (holding on the outside of it) feels weird and just like another Plot device to not invent something new. The writes could have gone into Sci-Fi here or use simple conveyer belts instead of such over the top dangerous vehicles.\r\n- The Season 3 Spacecrafts look cheaply in CGI unfortunately.\r\n\r\n**Pros:**\r\n\r\n- The moon CGI is pretty good.\r\n- The real sets look very decent. \r\n- Sound and Music Design is top. (German Lip Sync on point as always.)\r\n- The major family drama between the Baldwin's and Steven's is mostly good.\r\n- Often depicts space very scientificly real with it's real dangers.",

That makes a difference in the story telling.\r\n\r\nYou have lessons, like don't become reliant on superstitions that you really hardly see in the 00s and the 2019 revivals, and you only occasionally saw in the 80s revival. You have episodes that have a warning, a clear cut warning that serve as a guideline.\r\n\r\nAnd then you have your pure science fiction episodes that, even then, come with a love of pure irony that made the series so well loved. The twists and turns are spooky and heartwarming.\r\n\r\nWhat's not to love?",

Some of the subplots became very silly and unrealistic, and their “This is Us” forays into the past and future seemed derivative and contrived. Susie and Mrs. Maisel seemed to be drawn larger than life and almost above the fray, and the rest of the cast wasn’t quite strong enough to do the heavy lifting of moving the story along. I am not saying it caused me to dislike the show or stop watching, because it didn’t. But as someone who writes novels myself, I felt they were so eager to build an edge into the events of the show, they may not have noticed that in gaining that edge they lost their graceful story arc.",

  "content": "Wow. I mean it unfortunately came out in 97 and ended in '03 which was really the worst possible time for me. That was going to HS and working full time to save for college and then going to college and working two jobs to avoid debt time.\r\n\r\nSo when it came out I was vaguely aware of it and some people who's opinions on things like this I still trust absolutely loved it... and some actually hated it. Which to me made it a controversial must see for me... but 97-03 was just not the time.\r\n\r\nI didn't get to watch it until life calmed down a bit and that was around '09. And, of course, by then NO ONE wanted to talk about i and everyone had moved on to other shows. So I was left in my own Buffy Bubble and it became a sort of private love affair.\r\n\r\nSo... what you have here is a television series based on B-Movie tropes that then turns them upside down in a way that you will absolutely love... if you love B-Movies and all their tropes.\r\n\r\nThe cast is across the board hysterical. It's not really a comedy, but you're going to at least chuckle in every episode.\r\n\r\nAnd the pretty blond ditz that dies in every B horror movie is the kick-butt savior. Which is problematic in 2020 because you aren't supposed to acknowledge that women were ever portrayed as heroic before 2016, and, as a result, any mention of this will get you the N , M, and F word labels by people want to say that they are fighting for equality and thus Buffy doesn't fit in their timelines....\r\n\r\n... so even today it's controversial... but this time it is controversial by the people that SHOULD like it... because it was made before 2016 so they don't.\r\n\r\nPoint being, it is awesome from start to finish... I'm one of the freaks that didn't take any issue with Dawn...and if you have one of the better teachers you are going to learn all about how it forever changed the English language... so there you go, if the title is the reason you don't like it, you got that academia link.\r\n\r\nBut, who cares, it's just fun to watch and isn't that the point?",

So the gods want, personna dream. As if the kraft happens, the series goes beyond the original work, admiringly well. The details, scenarios, characters. As a youngster I read mostly the twisted Philip K. Dick stories, those with bugs... Who knows how many, forty years ago? Not me.Heinlein or Le Guin, The Stars My Destination, the Heechee saga, Dorsai, even \"old style space operas\" by EE Doc Smith, Clifford Simak, to name a few, seemed to leave a clearer picture than Philip K. Dick which one must reread here and then considering the number of superb cinema and TV \"Adaptations\", too much to refer or choose one as \"the best\".\r\nNot a fan of dystopian literature or ordinary TV series. But nothing of ordinary is here at play and there are Utopian undeniable traces. Art, decadence, suffering and resilience, life at its fullest. Love, and the hero within each child to crown the cake.\r\nThis work of distinguished direction, production, excellent acting and good pace, constitutes a good ensemble, rising the level and not defrauding our founded expectations. For personal reasons I usually expect the conclusion or at least two sequences and then let some distance from trailers, critics. Tasted it at a given opportunity. Better late than sorrow.\r\nIt was a pleasure to follow, in a row, three seasons of The Man in the High Castle. Congratulations to the crew.\r\nHonored, with a bow.",

  "content": "# One of the best TV dramas in recent memory\r\n<b>First, a disclaimer:</b> I've not read Dicks' original version of <i>The Man in the High Castle</i>, nor do I intend to read it. I am judging the show entirely on its own merits, without any influence or critiquing related to the novel.\r\n\r\n## On to the review!\r\n\r\nI'm going to keep this short and simple, so you don't have to read a shit-ton of stuff and so that I don't write any spoilers. Here's what you need to know:\r\n\r\nAs a sci-fi story, <i>The Man in the High Castle</i> falls a bit short. The showrunners tried to wrap up the sci-fi bit at the end, but they did a pretty piss-poor job. Budget cuts? Rushed delivery? Who knows? Fortunately, the sci-fi aspect of this story isn't actually what makes it great.\r\n\r\nWhat makes <i>The Man in the High Castle</i> great storytelling and great television is the alt-history and the in-depth character story arcs; in particular, the story of the Smiths—the highest-ranking family in the Nazis' American Reich—is absolutely fantastic. In John and Helen Smith, we get to explore what it might have meant for regular Americans to throw their lots in with the Nazi Party had the Axis powers won WWII. Through dialogue and flashbacks, we get to see how joining the Nazi Party twisted both John and Helen into persons unrecognizable from their alt-world selves. Truly, the Smiths' story arc was easily my favorite, and it is the backbone of the show. You will never feel sorry for John or Helen, but you will understand them—and you will feel sorry for their children.\r\n\r\nAdd to this mix some solid intrigue and action, plus a strong, capable female protagonist, and you will see why <i>The Man in the High Castle</i> is really good television.\r\n\r\nAlso, don't let my initial talk of the sci-fi component scare you off. The showrunners may not have done a great job of resolving that part of the story, but the characters' stories were all resolved to my satisfaction. (Well, with one exception, but...it didn't ruin the show for me.)\r\n\r\nI recommend this show highly to people who enjoy:\r\n\r\n- Military fiction\r\n- Historical fiction\r\n- Alt-historical fiction\r\n- [Light] sci-fi\r\n- Political intrigues/dramas/thrillers",

The result is so much filler that it seems to drag and not really accomplish anything of value.\r\n\r\nHowever, the story is interesting, as is the world that it is set in. Unlike A Handmaiden's Tale, or really, a lot of other shows, it doesn't feel like you are being lectured to.\r\n\r\nBut it does feel like it dragged. All they needed to do was lesson the amount of episodes to fit the story, or add a subplot or two more and it would have been a killer show.\r\n\r\nInstead, the result is a good show that has been stretched until it's paper thin\r\n\r\nAnd then season 3 hit and what was good was replaced with woke messaging.

  "content": "*A review of \"iCarly: Season One, Volume One,\" written in 2009.*  I will just state it at the outset. Although I am 40 years old, and \"iCarly,\" the hit Nickelodeon sitcom, is meant for my children, I honestly think it is the funniest comedy on television right now.\r\n\r\nCarly Shay (Miranda Cosgrove) is a junior high schooler in Seattle, living with her older twenty-something brother, pop artist Spencer (Jerry Trainor). Their father is in the military, stationed overseas, and the two live in a giant three story loft apartment with an elevator. Carly's best friend (and budding juvenile delinquent) is Sam (Jennette McCurdy) who lives with her as yet unseen mom. The two also pal around with Freddie (Nathan Kress), a technical whiz whose love for Carly is well known.\r\n\r\nCarly, Sam, and Freddie webcast the internet show \"iCarly,\" and the Nickelodeon series follows their rising popularity, and dealings with everyday life at school and home. The DVD features thirteen episodes from the show's first season, plus some special features. I have listed each episode individually (they were all broadcast in 2007 and 2008), along with a capsule review, and my IMDB.com rating (1-10, with 10 being the best), and favorite line from the episode:\r\n\r\nDISC ONE\r\niPilot (written by Dan Schneider, directed by Steve Hoefer)\r\nBecause this is the pilot episode, there is some pretty obvious plot exposition mixed into the story of how Carly, Sam, and Freddie decided to do a webcast. We also get to meet sympathetic school Principal Franklin (Tim Russ) and mean teacher Miss Briggs (a hysterical Mindy Sterling). Despite the newness and some awkwardness (Freddie luckily loses the shrillness after this episode), I laughed all the way through. 7/10.\r\nFavorite line: \"Yeah, except he doesn't have Miss Briggs' crazy pointy boobs.\"\r\n\r\niWant More Viewers (written by Steve Holland & Steve Molaro, directed by Adam Weissman)\r\nFreddie and Spencer team up against Carly and Sam to see who can come up with the best idea to get more viewers. Hysterical from start to finish, especially the \"Messin' With Lewbert\" bit. 9/10.\r\nFavorite line: \"Pee on Carl?\"\r\n\r\niHatch Chicks (written by Steven Molaro, directed by David Kendall)\r\nA science experiment goes wrong and Carly, Sam, Freddie, Spencer, and Freddie's science project partner Duke must find six baby chicks in the giant three story apartment. Consistently funny, with many memorable lines. My seven year old son's reaction upon seeing Miranda Cosgrove in a swimsuit? \"Carly's hot.\" 9/10.\r\nFavorite line (tough call): \"Wow, I've never seen dried beef make a boy so happy.\"\r\n\r\niDream of Dance (written by Dan Schneider, directed by Adam Weissman)\r\nThe \"iCarly\" team decide to open their site to dance videos from their viewers, and are inundated with over three thousand. The trio slogs through a few hundred, fall asleep, and dream themselves into some nicely choreographed dance routines. The music is fun, the backup dancers are sensational, and Trainor's final dance sealed this as my favorite episode of the first season. 10/10.\r\nFavorite lines (no way I could come up with just one): \"How dare you children boo a dancing Scotsman!,\" \"Because I move my legs in a fiery explosion of flailing limbs and floppy passion, wanna see it?,\" \"If he's a nub, then someday I want to be Mrs. Carly Nub,\" \"Get out of here, Gibby, this is my nightmare!,\" and \"Oh, Juiceboy's got a friend.\"\r\n\r\niLike Jake (written by Dan Schneider, directed by Steve Hoefer)\r\nWhen Jake, the hottest guy in school, breaks up with his girlfriend, Carly books him on the web show so he can sing, not realizing he is terrible. Strong plot and pacing, and nice work from Austin Butler as Jake. 8/10.\r\nFavorite line: \"The internet can distort room size.\"\r\n\r\niWanna Stay with Spencer (written by Arthur Gradstein, directed by Adam Weissman)\r\nAfter Carly almost gets hurt by one of Spencer's nutty sculptures, their grandfather decides Carly needs to come live with him in nearby Yakima. Trainor really gets to shine here. 8/10.\r\nFavorite line: \"What's her next phase? Stealing cars? Swimming with hobos?\"\r\n\r\niNevel (written by Steve Holland, directed by Steve Hoefer)\r\nMy second favorite episode has Carly meeting Nevel, an eleven year old boy who gives \"iCarly\" a bad review on his hugely popular website after Carly rejects his advances. I don't know if he was eligible, but Reed Alexander is Emmy worthy as Nevel. 10/10.\r\nFavorite line: \"Do you feel the rue? Ya feel it!\"\r\n\r\nDISC TWO\r\niScream on Halloween (written by Jake Farrow, directed by Steve Hoefer)\r\nIn this Halloween themed episode, Carly, Sam, and Freddie webcast from a haunted apartment in their building while Spencer tries to carve a giant pumpkin and keep trick or treaters at bay (he forgot to buy candy). A lesser episode in the \"iCarly\" canon, but still funny here and there. 6/10.\r\nFavorite line: \"You gotta sick mama!\"\r\n\r\niSpy a Mean Teacher (written by Steven Molaro, directed by Steve Hoefer)\r\nCarly and Freddie decide to follow Miss Briggs around with a video camera to see what teachers do outside of school, and end up getting trapped in her apartment. Very, very funny stuff, with the entire cast doing well. 9/10.\r\nFavorite lines (tie): \"My Aunt Maggie's boobs look more real than that, and they're ridiculous,\" and \"You dented my blow stick and punctured my squeeze bag!\"\r\n\r\niWant to Date Freddie (written by Steve Holland, directed by Adam Weissman)\r\nFreddie's new girlfriend Valerie wants to do a web show of her own, and tries to steal both Freddie and Sam from \"iCarly.\" More fast moving than a network sitcom, with Freddie's first date and Valerie's web show the highlights. 9/10.\r\nFavorite line: \"You won't get respect if your back's not erect.\"\r\n\r\niWant a World Record (written by Dan Schneider, directed by Roger Christiansen)\r\nCarly, Sam, and Freddie try to get into the Jonas Book of World Records by continuously streaming their webshow for over twenty-four hours. Typically surreal, and funny, episode with excellent supporting guest cast. 9/10.\r\nFavorite line: \"I'm obsessed with the fattest priest. The chubby ones mean nothing to me.\"\r\n\r\niRue the Day (written by Dan Schneider, directed by David Kendall)\r\nNevel returns to ruin \"iCarly\" just as they are getting the pop group Plain White T's on the webcast. Alexander as Nevel still cracks me up. 8/10.\r\nFavorite line: \"You feel it, Carly? You feel the rue? Ya feel it?!\"\r\n\r\niPromise Not to Tell (written by Dicky Murphy, directed by Steve Hoefer)\r\nThe final episode of this two disc set has Sam hacking into the school's computer and changing Carly and Freddie's grades. They then lie to family and school administration to cover for Sam. Chock full of funny lines, which make up for a couple of awkwardly played scenes. 8/10.\r\nFavorite line: \"Hobos can't afford cable.\"\r\n\r\nEXTRAS\r\n\r\n\"Leave it All to Me\" Music Video\r\nCosgrove also sings the infectious theme song to the series, with a little help from former \"Drake & Josh\" co-star Drake Bell. The video is kind of meh, but the song will stay with you for days. 7/10.\r\n\r\nExtended and Exclusive Making of the Video \"Leave it All to Me\"\r\nThe \"iCarly\" cast also appears in the music video, and are pretty entertaining behind the scenes, too. 7/10.\r\n\r\nBehind-the-Scenes Extras\r\nThese video bites are about ninety seconds long, and show the cast goofing off behind the scenes. All of them are naturally funny, although you won't learn any huge insight here. 7/10.\r\n\r\nSo, what can I say? I am a forty year old man who laughs at junior high antics. Although, the show's creator, Dan Schneider, is a comedic genius. He is about my age, and adds a touch of surrealism, some great running gags, and an excellent cast to Nickelodeon, making an even better show than his last hit- \"Drake & Josh.\" My one complaint about the DVD collection is that a couple of the shows are out of order, which makes for some \"huh?\" moments when we meet new characters. I have been keeping up with Season 2, with \"iPie\" quite possibly the funniest sitcom episode in cable television history. I can find nothing bad about the cast, all of them shine, including guest and recurring characters like Freddie's mom (Mary Scheer) and evil doorman Lewbert. Miranda Cosgrove, Jennette McCurdy, Nathan Kress, and Jerry Trainor have such a great chemistry onscreen, it's creepy.\r\n\r\nSure, you might watch this and not find it that hilarious, and that's okay. I am completely immature. You can have your \"Two and a Half Men\" (which is only funny when that kid is on) or your \"How I Met Your Mother\" (which is only funny when Doogie Howser is on), I will take my \"iCarly: Season 1, Volume 1\" DVD set with its running jokes (Schneider's name appearing here and there, hobo jokes, the word 'nub') and giggle alone, waiting anxiously for Season 1, Volume 2 to come out in a little while. I told everyone at work I bought this set for my kids, and that is partially true, but I think I enjoy it more.",

  "content": "This is a really good show and is one of the family programs with drama and humor that are often popular for family viewing. The show is based on a memoir written by a midwife, so it was a bit awkward when the co-lead actress left the show  after a few seasons, but the show was strong enough to go on without a hitch. It has a great ensemble cast, after all. It is a little weird, however, that the character who left the show still does the narration as an old woman at the beginning and end of each episode.\r\n\r\nSo like many good shows, it follows a formula of sorts. There are two or three guest stars who have dramatic plots every show, and at least one complicated birth. Plus we have the continuous subplots of the regular characters. Some of the developments are predictable, but the writing is good and there is usually room for a tear in your eye near the end of the episodes. Overall it is well worth watching.",

  "content": "Who knew the SJW-ism was infecting DC even back then?  I can say this with all honesty, DC can eat a d____k!!!  They turn Aqualad, the black teen male and newly appointed Aquaman, gay. It wasn't bad enough they made him blonde (something that is not possible for a black man), and blue-eyed, no.  \"Let's make him gay for no reason in the next series.\"  And not only that, they have his \"boyfriend\" being the very guy his ex-heterosexual girlfriend had, to replace Aqua-lad, to be his boyfriend.  So she dies(couldn't name the episode where that happens), and her new boyfriend and \"Aquaman\" hook up in a homosexual relationship!?!   I hazzard a guess because of equally shared sorrow of her loss???  Really!??!  Seriously?   \r\nDC really thought this was going to be cool??  \r\nThe series never really gained it's feet.  Because of things like the forementioned, none of the characters' stories ever really gets told, because the overall story has a course NO ONE at the production company could nail down.   You want to see some progression, but all you really learn is that \"there is grave peril just around the bend.\"  And that's it.  This should be Young Justice, but it's \"The Justice League & Too Many Younger Superheroes to Count\".\r\nThis show had potential, but something devastating was obviously happening behind the cameras and ink pens of the artists.  \r\n\r\n'Nuff said.",

That's pretty much how most good TV action shows work. For instance, shows like The Big Valley and The Virginian would have the regular players be the \"passing crowd of the public\" for whatever guest stars came around with their drama.\r\nIn other words, the \"drama kings and queens\" come and go.\r\nIn this show, there was always some ironic twist to a \"cold case\" of murder. It might not even be \"murder\" when it's figured out. \r\nThere are lots of \"flashbacks\", and of course these don't involve the regular players.\r\nThe show had a fresh approach that one doesn't generally see from the usual hacks of the writer's guild.",

  "content": "A very Dugeon & Dragon-esk type of animation.  The animation company is very well known and has good quality.  I believe they are very similar in what was used to make _Gargoyles_ tv animated series.  \r\nThere is a character for each of the classes, and fortunately each character _is_ a character unto themselves.  They are very different and fuse into what a good team of friends could be if they found themselves born to such a world.  There is enough gore to go around, and the writers did well with the comedy and gore alike.  The story for this title's pilot is a solid 8 out of 10.  The rich kid's mission for revenge against a sinisterly evil and neigh OP bad guy is epically done well, and is NOT something that is expected coming out of a Netflix streaming show.  Okay, enough about the pros.\r\n\r\nThe Cons:  And ofcourse when talking about **_anything_** from Netflix there are the **glaring** cancerous influences of social politics infesting the show.  In most cases it's usually the narrative that is corrupted, but when that is not a possibility, SJWs settle for the background.  There are different races in areas where there should be no variety in the people.  There is the typical flamboyantly gay racial minority fat-guy who is a keystone in supplying or getting knowledge of important artifacts.  >exasperated sigh< Ofcourse one of the young men in the main party has to flirt with the fat-guy to bargain with him. Annnnd ofcourse fat-gay-minority guy is OP in his own right, because you have to balance out the implied insult that successful minority men of commerce are all \"flamers.\"  And what adventure is not complete without toilet humor?  Because that's what you need as you eat dinner to watch a show.  >groans<\r\n\r\nAnother major gripe of mine is the over-compensation of rude language to qualify for the streaming rating.  When I say overcompensate, I mean the \"seinen\" aspect to the show is unbalanced.\r\n\r\n  It's like how are you going to swear so much in a show, show SOOOO much blood and gore, then leave out the nudity??  And if there is nudity, why does it have to be tied to something gay?  Usually with Netflix, this means male gay.  And since the majority of the viewing audience is male, it becomes, \"Why did you even bother??\"  It kills the nuance of the show, it's grittiness of the age.  Gay instances were _never_ mainstream even in that time.  Sure it went on, but no one gave it that kind of attention.  And if they did, no one mentioned it aloud, not without threat of loosing their head.  Even gay romance with women, from a guy's point of view, is a snooze-fest of epic proportions because with the social politics not wanting to \"degrade women...\", this little edict (no one asked for) neutralizes **_all_** sensuality (if there ever was any).  There is nothing to the show that makes you want to see _more_ of this show if that is supposed to the \"eye candy\"!?!  _That's_ what we're getting?!?  I counted, you know.  There were two pairs of boobs in this entire 12 episode first season.  4 tits; one of those pair belonged to an ugly mutant.  Funny story, lackluster presentation.  That is not enough boobs to get me to put up with another season of non-existent nudity, covert or overt homosexuality, and excessively crude language.  You take out any two of these and you are left with a show not worth viewing. At best it's okay; at worst, it's annoying.  Again, it becomes, \"Why am I watching this???\"\r\n\r\nThe studio would have done better to ex out all nudity or implied situations, modern swearing, and gore.  And just ran the show as an animated series.  Kids (should) out number adults when it comes to this kind of viewing genre, so the studio would have been better served in this regard.  And again this \"imbalance\" has caused some serious errors in judgement and showing; potentially hurting its Nielsen rating.  In other words, it could have been more with less, instead of trying to be something more and falling short.  There is enough story, plot, action and engaging characters to make this show good.  In fact, if I ignore the social political negatives (with a LOT of effort), the show is downright entertaining.  I simply don't want to have to put in a focused effort (should never have to) to ignore the SJW aspect _every time_ I watch the show.\r\n\r\nDon't know about you, but I'm not holding any bated breath for next season.\r\n\r\nGood Luck in your viewing.  --  Bob  --",

That last one really hurts the series cause you never feel like any of the main characters are in danger, even when they're bleeding out and near-death.\r\n\r\nArcane (2021) was near perfection, Castlevania (2017) had some writing nonsense, Season 4 of The Dragon Prince (2018) killed the series for me and Cyberpunk: Edgerunners (2022) is just trope-y garbage. Vox Machina (2022) sits somewhere between The Dragon Prince Season 3 and Edgerunners.\r\n\r\n---\r\nI'm at the end of Season 2.

That said, this series lead character is somewhat less selfless than Reacher, as the tracker extracts a finders fee, upon success. \r\n\r\nWhat helps this series is the above average character development. The main character fits the dependable, tough guy stereotype but has enough personal charm and a past, with a measure of originality and complexity, to be genuinely interesting and intriguing. \r\n\r\nEach episode offers a new tale and a back story that slowly unwinds as the series progresses. In and of themselves, the episodic stories could be better. They are not dreadful but they can at times, feel predictable  and formulaic. A little more inspiration here, would be nice. \r\n\r\nAs you also might expect too, there's a dash of the usual woke twaddle but thankfully, its dialled down enough, to not be overly irritating.\r\n\r\nIn summary, a worthwhile action thriller series that offers decent character development, an interesting back story and competent episodic adventures, that draw on the \"trackers\", rather unique set of skills.",

Ultimately I think this is a show that is uniquely appealing to the demographic it focuses on -- late 20s to early 30s -- which is likely a large part of the reason I myself enjoyed it.

And there were several scenarios when in real life they would go a different way. For example, at least 4 snipers and several Police units shooting to our characters, but miraculously not a single bullet touches them or cops driving with suspect in a van get attacked by others to free the suspect and put a bomb on the van. Cops get panicked and scared and they leave the vehicle. If those people came to rescue the suspect and help her to escape, they wouldn't put a real bomb on the van and kill her in the van. It's illogical. But somehow cops seem stupid and can't think of it, which again makes this show unrealistic... And there are lots of such flaws in this show, which ruin the experience, I can't give high ratings to this show. Sorry. In real life, things don't go like that.",

  "content": "Oh well, all good things must come to an end - except, well, this isn’t really very good. It’s reminiscent of the second Enfield Haunting one (2016) as the Smurl family start to find their home is being terrorised by a spirit that this time has been malevolently lingering on the land that their new home has been built on. Initially, the Warrens (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) are reluctant to get involved, but when a priest is found dangling down the stairwell of the bishop’s residence and then their daughter “Judy” (Mia Tomlinson) - whom we learn had her own near-death experience at birth - gets involved with the struggling and terrified family, it falls to them and her unsuspecting but plucky boyfriend “Tony” (Ben Hardy) to try and save the day before the body count gets any larger. I liked Hardy in “Unicorns” (2023). He brings an enthusiasm to the roles he plays and he actually does fine here. The rest of it, though, is entirely by-the-numbers stuff only now we are in the attic with a mysterious mirror. Every scenario that involves a degree of peril also involves a degree of stupidity. Who walks into a darkened room at the best of times without turning on the light? Let alone when the place is creaking and moaning. Farmiga looks more like she belongs in “Downton Abbey” every time she appears and at well over two hours, this is seriously strung out as it tries to incorporate familial and investigative history into this fairly repetitious series of spooky set-pieces. Sorry, but this just isn’t anyone’s finest hour, the story is pretty unoriginal and I went away hoping that this was, indeed, the last rites.",

  "content": "This doesn’t start well, indeed after about ten minutes I thought it was just going to be “Tyrion Lannister” does “Bruce Banner”. Well I was quite pleasantly surprised as it takes those foundations and, with it’s tongue firmly implanted in it’s cheek, and with him suitably armed with his newly radioactive mop, we set off on a crime caper with a difference. Kevin Bacon’s “Bob Garbinger” runs a big chemical company that routinely churns out enough gunge into the rivers and streams of the city to give Julia Roberts and Albert Finney enough work for a lifetime. “Winston” (Peter Dinklage) is trying to rear teenage stepson “Wade” (Jacob Tremblay) whilst holding down a menial job in one of those plants. When he gets a terrible diagnosis from his doctor, he thinks he has company health insurance - but when platinum turns out not to be all it’s cracked up to be, he decides to ask his boss to intercede. That just sees him rather savagely treated and dumped into a drain where, well let’s just say it isn’t envy that has turned him green. Meantime, we learn that all in his garden isn’t exactly rosy for “Garbinger” either, so with hoodlums chasing him and his wacky brother “Fritz” (Elijah Wood doing his best impersonation of “Gru”) organising a kid-napping it falls to the irritated “Toxie” to save the city, nobble the baddies, rescue “Wade” and maybe even stop his eye from constantly popping out of it’s socket on a great big stalk! This is quite an entertaining parody of many things super-hero with shades of Hammer and John Carpenter thrown into a mix that is held together amiably by a Dinklage who looks like he is enjoying himself. He even manages to rescue a cat! The scenario serves to remind us of just how cavalier we have been and still are with our environment in the name of convenience and though Bacon isn’t really at his best, he and his band of “Nuts” provide plenty to swing a pretty lethal sponge-on-stick at! High brow it isn’t, but when “Winston” discovers the astonishingly corrosive powers of his own wee…! Mindless and enjoyable, and I liked it in the end. Wouldn’t bet against a sequel.",

  "content": "My quick rating - 7.0/10. Somewhere in the cosmic video store of nostalgia, my 12-year-old self just did a cartwheel in parachute pants. I grew up rewinding the original Toxic Avenger on worn-out VHS until the tracking lines looked like snowstorms over Tromaville. So when Hollywood whispered “remake,” I braced myself for PG-13 sterilization and emotional damage. But bless Macon Blair’s radioactive heart—he didn’t just do it justice, he hosed it down in glowing sludge and handed it a mop.\r\n\r\nOur new hero is Winston Gooze (Peter Dinklage), a terminally ill janitor who gets baptized in toxic goop and comes out looking like a meatball with abs and a Costco-sized case of trauma. Dinklage doesn’t just play Toxie, he owns him. He swings that glowing mop like Excalibur dipped in biohazard, and suddenly I remembered why deformed vigilantes matter: because nothing says “hero” like ripping someone’s intestines out while trying to make it to parent-teacher night.\r\n\r\nAnd can we talk about the casting? Kevin Bacon as the corporate tyrant who drinks villain monologues for breakfast? Chef’s kiss. Elijah Wood pops up as his gremlin-esque brother, looking like he crawled out of a vat of expired hair dye and cryptid rumors swirling in the time warp. Their private death squad, the Killer Nutz, is less “elite mercenaries” and more “fetish convention meets meth carnival,” which is a compliment in the Troma-verse.\r\n\r\nNice touch naming the crusading reporter Melvin (Shaun Dooley)—a blood-splattered wink to the OG mop-wielder himself. And Taylour Paige as J.J., Toxie’s ride-or-die, holds her own with a mix of badassery and the facial expressions of someone who’s just seen a spleen used as a yo-yo. How about that son, Wade (Jacob Tremblay), busting out some moves on the dance floor? Leads me to my next point.\r\n\r\nThe humor? Alive. Mutated. Proudly infectious. The girls’ dance troupe shaking it to an aggressively inappropriate song had me choking on nostalgia. Speaking of, if the music budget really landed on “Hall of the Mountain King” instead of “Gutter Ballet,” shortly after, in the street. That is Troma logic, baby. Or a joke I am not getting. I salute the chaos.\r\n\r\nNow, the gore. Oh, the gore. Heads get pop-quizzed off with a mop. Limbs fly like bargain-bin confetti. Practical effects hold hands with CGI the way drunks slow-dance at weddings—awkward, sloppy, and perfect. It still feels like a B-movie dipped in beer money and glitter vomit, exactly where it belongs.\r\n\r\nBlair doesn’t sand off the edges—he sharpens them. This isn’t some sanitized “modern reimagining.” There are still tits, cameos, filth, goop, indignity, and heart—because even under ten layers of melted skin, The Toxic Avenger is still just a guy trying to save his kid and be the world’s scariest father-in-law.\r\n\r\nIs it better than the original? No. But it’s not trying to be. It’s leaning into the glorious stupidity, raunchy enthusiasm, and gleeful carnage that made Troma what it is. Unlike the neutered Hellraiser reboot crimes we recently had to relive, this one embraces the cheesy, sleazy, bloody mayhem and dares us not to grin.\r\n\r\nAlso: Lloyd Kaufman cameo? Check. Post-credit joke about a billion-dollar box office to finance a sequel? Beautiful. Gratuitous nudity because “this is Troma”? You bet your irradiated butt.\r\n\r\nWhat else can I say? It made the 12-year-old VHS warrior in me scream, “I TOLD YOU SO,” and the adult me kind of wants a glowing mop. Now with 30% More Mop-Based Dismemberment!",

  "content": "<em>'War of the Worlds'</em>... boy oh boy. I've been out of the film loop recently, but word of this disaster even reached me. I had to check it out for myself to get it watched before I got spoiled. Sometimes the internet piles in to jointly overhate a movie... this is not one of those times.\r\n\r\nWhat a mess, there are sadly no redeeming qualities to it. First and foremost, it takes itself way too seriously. There are (I think) a few jokes scattered in there, though they last for literal seconds - everything else is played straight. It had a better chance of working as a comedy, albeit barely.\r\n\r\nThe initial novelty of the \"screenlife\" (never knew that was a thing until now) set-up is kinda interesting, though it very quickly wears off completely. It ends up getting annoying, especially the constant calling noises - almost gave me a headache. It'd work as a short, not for 90mins!\r\n\r\nThe computer stuff looks quite awful too, the most boring and least creative way of utilizing the whole PC concept too. They literally just zoom in and out for the entire flick. There is one scene where they do the <em>'Jaws'</em> dolly zoom effect, which is minorly cool to be fair.\r\n\r\nThere is also a piece of photoshop right at the end that is hilariously bad, I'm pretty certain I could do a better job... OK, maybe not, but you know. The whole ending had me chuckling (negatively) at the film, with that aforementioned moment but also with that flying delivery thing.\r\n\r\nI've got this far into this (overly long) review without noting the acting talent. It has a few good names attached, but none of them do anything remotely standout - but, in fairness, have barely anything to work with. You could place any world leading lad or lass in this and it'd be the same.\r\n\r\nIce Cube... I'm gonna let this one slide, because I do like him. Same goes for Eva Longoria. Both of 'em are, erm, not good though. The only actor I'd give a tiny solace of praise to would be Devon Bostick (Rodrick to you and I), who has one scene where his teary eyes look kinda convincing. As you can see, I'm reaching!\r\n\r\nI don't know what's worse. This movie, or the fact that I've just typed up seven paragraphs about it. We're both as bad as each other! This only avoids the bottom rating from yours truly through comparison. Incredibly, I have seen worse.",

That could keep them eating for a while and while they're distracted, you set up a nuclear bomb inside them that is on a timer and they could prevent it from going nuclear but doing so will cause them to sacrifice themselves for the greater good.\r\n\r\nAnyway.

Ufotable has once again shattered expectations, delivering what is arguably the greatest animation ever seen in anime history. Every frame of Infinity Castle is a painting. Every battle is a symphony of light, color, movement, and emotion.\r\n\r\nThe sheer scale of the Infinity Castle arc is staggering. Shifting gravity, kaleidoscopic architecture, and relentless pacing pull you into a world that feels boundless and terrifying. And through this madness, the animators create visual clarity and storytelling precision that defy logic. The fights aren’t just flashy—they’re intimate, brutal, and deeply emotional. You feel every breath, every strike, every sacrifice.\r\n\r\nTanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke, and the Hashira face impossible odds with a sense of weight and urgency that grips your chest. Character moments hit harder than ever. The Upper Moons are terrifying in both presence and power. And Muzan? An absolute force of dread.\r\n\r\nWhat truly sets Infinity Castle apart isn’t just the spectacle—though it is unparalleled. It’s the way the animation serves the heart of the story. Loyalty, grief, fury, and love are painted across the screen with every cut, every cry, every flicker of a blade.\r\n\r\nThis is peak anime. A cultural milestone. A visual symphony.\r\nDemon Slayer: Infinity Castle is what happens when anime dares to be legendary.\r\n\r\n🔥 A flawless 10/10. Nothing comes close. 🔥",

I felt that they tried to squeeze too many side stories in one movie. In the first 2/3 of the movie, you keep going back and forth from fight scenes to side stories, which breaks the tempo. It was not well executed, and I would have preferred if they just finished one side story and then come back to the fight scenes to finish it. Also, many side stories were finished in rush, which did not add much context of emotions.\r\n\r\nOverall, the actions sequences and sound effects were great. I think they have 2 more movies linked up to finale, and hope they conclude the story in a more meaningful way.",

  "content": "This latest series of adventures sees “Tanjiro” and “Nezuko” drawn into the equivalent of an animated Escher drawing as both they and the Hashira have to face a formidable array of Upper Rank demons as they sink lower and lower into this perfectly detailed, fluid, abyss of a construction. With the ultimate battle against “Muzan” getting ever closer, they must first face the mighty “Akaza” who has not only a remarkable arsenal of quirks and skills, but also something hitherto unseen by our intrepid “Tanjiro” - bit how to defeat it? It’s a film that starts as we are used to, with end to end combat scenes but around the midway point, we flip the vinyl over and enter onto an altogether more informative path. We are being told of the tragedies that touched the life of “Akaza” before his demonic days. We learn of a time when he was capable of love and affection, but was in turn subject to the most heinous of betrayals that left his soul vulnerable to the temptations of a life where revenge on those who offended him (think “Anakin Skywalker” a little bit) when offered to him. It is good to see little more in-depth characterisation going on in this film, it helps us to balance the forces of good and evil and there is more than plenty action to keep the pace moving and avoid that backstory becoming too melancholic. The setting within the aptly named “Infinity Castle” challenges linear perspectives effectively with an effective sense of the multi-dimensional that allows the artists (and the CGI) to assume something gossamer-like as solid structures melt and what is down becomes up and gravity takes a back seat. It has some gore to it, and some scenes aren’t for the faint-hearted, but it’s the best yet of the “Demon Slayer” movies and stands alone, well.",

The pacing is relentless but never empty, balancing spectacle with raw emotion as Tanjiro and the Hashira face their darkest trials yet. While it’s clearly setting the stage for an epic trilogy (with 2027 and 2029 still looming), this first entry stands tall on its own—delivering both tragedy and triumph in equal measure.

  "content": "Written and directed by first-time filmmaker Lim Dae-hee, Holy Night: Demon Hunters follows three underground demon hunters who operate like private investigators who are too unorthodox to be cops and too accepting of the occult to be associated with the church.\r\n\r\nThe demon-hunting trinity is led by Ba Woo (Ma Dong-Seok), a beast of a man capable of solving most of his problems with his bulking fists. Whatever slips through Ba Woo’s fingers is typically dealt with by Sharon (Seohyun), a woman who can sense and exorcise demons. Then there’s Kim Goon (Lee David), a demon hunter in training who is the team's tech support.\r\n\r\nA neuropsychiatrist named Jung-won (Kyung Soo-jin) is trying to help her sister Eun-seo (Jung Ji-so) who is in desperate need of an exorcism. With the church unable to assist with their stance on exorcisms it’s up to Ba Woo and his team to save Eun-seo.\r\n\r\nIt feels like Holy Night: Demon Hunters is the second installment of a franchise that nobody knew about. A prequel webtoon called Holy Night: The Zero is available on Naver Webtoon and is currently 13 episodes long. The webtoon could add more depth to the film since Holy Night: Demon Hunters seems to struggle to keep your interest for its measly 92-minute duration. Like Richard Kelly’s Southland Tales though, viewers shouldn’t have to read or watch something else to fully appreciate a director’s vision.\r\n\r\nThe action horror film teases a real-world takeover by not only demons but Lucifer himself. The credits introduce the audience to every demon that could come into play. Holy Night: Demon Hunters barely scratches the surface of the ideas it introduces so it’s a bit confusing why so many aspects are shown and not utilized. The film then decides to vaguely describe semi-intriguing backgrounds for characters barely seen through to completion.\r\n\r\nBa Woo is using all the money he’s making as a demon hunter to build an orphanage. He grew up as an orphan where the orphanage he grew up was slaughtered by his best friend whom he viewed as a brother. The two of them gained a demonic power, and Ba Woo used his power for good while his brother became a demon.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the rest of the film is devoted to Eun-Seo, her exorcism, and which demon has possessed her. The exorcism Sharon uses on her is broken down into six stages (and a piece of bamboo since it thwarts off demonic energy for whatever reason). The six stages of exorcism are presence, deception, break point, voice, clash, and expulsion.\r\n\r\nMost of the characters in the film are underdeveloped. Ba Woo is a big, buffed dude struggling with both literal and inner demons inside of him. Sharon is in the same boat and her power could easily sway her to the dark side. Apart from asking for a raise and being the most sympathetic of the bunch, Kim Goon doesn’t do much.\r\n\r\nJung-won is so annoyingly written. The character is meant to be a burden by being in the room during the exorcism for no reason other than being an obstacle, making stupid decisions at every turn, and being an inconsolable crier at every turn.\r\n\r\nThe VFX in the film is a mixed bag. Sometimes they look almost great like when Ba Woo punches demon-possessed people as smoke seeps from their bodies or the weird shadow demon that haunts him throughout the film. But the CGI highs come with a lot of visual lows and Holy Night: Demon Hunters struggles with decent to janky CGI the majority of the time.\r\n\r\nHoly Night: Demon Hunters is a punchier version of Constantine. There are some fun sequences, but the film is a bummer overall. Ma Dong-seok typically chooses great projects to be a part of and it’s unfortunate that Holy Night: Demon Hunters feels so rushed and complete. A big dude storming around the city punching demons into submission sounds so awesome, but somehow Lim Dae-hee turned it into this thin, dull, and lifeless attempt at purification.",

It feels like a cheap imitation of a Shane Black film, rather than a genuine and memorable addition to his filmography.\r\n\r\nIt fails on almost every level, from the most basic technical aspects to the lack of originality in its script. It's a soulless project that wastes a talented cast and, more importantly, the viewer's time, leaving us wondering how the man behind such vibrant classics could deliver something so forgettable and devoid of passion.\r\n\r\nIt's proof that sometimes, a filmmaker's magic can simply vanish without a trace.\"\r\n\r\nRating: D+",

  "content": "Well good news, after ages and having given up trying “Sue” (Vanessa Kirby) and boffin “Reed” (Pedro Pascal) are going to have a bairn! This is great news for her brother “Johnny” (Joseph Quinn) and the stony fourth member of their gang “Ben” (Egon Moss-Bacharach). The news is greeted enthusiastically by their adoring fans too, but those celebrations are cut short when a mysterious woman descends from what looks like a meteor shower to forewarn them that their planet is doomed. Her (Julia Garner) boss “Galactus” (Ralph Ineson) is on his way, and he is hungry for not just some rare earths, but all of it! Blessed with their array of super-powers, the quartet embark in their warp-capable rocket to meet this chap and he offers them an alternative to global destruction. It’s one hell of a sacrifice for the would-be parents though, but with the fate of humanity hanging on their decision - what will they choose? Perhaps they can think of a scientific alternative? There is a slightly retro-look to the production, with their flying car looking like a converted Citroën that belonged in a Jacques Tati film, and there is plenty of inter-galactic adventure with some effective visual effects, a decent degree of menace and it stays sufficiently devoid of sentiment, and the multiverse, until the denouement. Though they do gel well together, none of the acting isn’t really anything special, nor is the writing, but “Ben” looks good with his beard and Quinn probably steals the show with his engagingly flaming character and his spray-on white 501s. There are loads of gadgets and gizmos and anyone who has ever had to argue with a child seat and a car might empathise, too. It’s an old-fashioned save the world movie that hasn’t sold it’s soul to the CGI, and I enjoyed it.",

  "content": "Much of The Fantastic Four: First Steps is built around Reed Richards (Pedro Pascal) and Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby) getting pregnant and having their child, Franklin. Everything seems to be built around baby proofing and preparing for someone new to enter their lives until The Silver Surfer (Julia Garner) arrives to let everyone know that an enormous cosmic being named Galactus plans to swing by and eat the entire planet. \r\n\r\nThe superhero film feels like a sci-fi film from the 1960s, which makes sense since Fantastic Four #1 debuted in 1961. Maybe it’s the bright colors or the fact that H.E.R.B.I.E. is featured so prominently, but the first half of the film feels like a multi-episode arc of The Jetsons.\r\n\r\nThings are lighthearted and fairly silly until The Silver Surfer shows up. But The Fantastic Four and James Gunn’s Superman seem to be honoring the silver age of comic books, which is a welcome change for superhero films.  \r\n\r\nOddly, the marketing makes it seem like the family bond amongst The Fantastic Four is so strong because it doesn’t seem that great while watching it. The film isn’t an origin story, as you only get a brief montage of how they got their powers. But there’s a lot of indecisiveness amongst the team with Franklin on the way. The way time passes in the film is weird. Sue’s pregnancy and Franklin’s age (apart from a certain time jump) seem accelerated, and it’s difficult to decipher if that much time has passed (nine months for the pregnancy, plus however many additional months Franklin is supposed to be) or if it’s fast-tracked because they all have powers.\r\n\r\nThe casting in The Fantastic Four: First Steps is fine, but they still seem to be finding a rhythm as a team. Reed’s brain works in a way that has him thinking of the worst scenarios, while his plans and logic stem from building everything around the most horrible solution. Sue just wants her baby to thrive in the presence of a loving family. She doesn’t want to give him to Galactus or decide his fate if he happens to have powers. She wants him to live and flourish with his own identity and choices.\r\n\r\nThe film seems to hint at Johnny being a womanizer, but he’s painfully single here. He latches onto The Silver Surfer and devotes a good chunk of the film to learning her language just so he can talk to her. The fate of the world may be at stake, sure, but dat silver ass has light years to travel and he’s got to make his moves now.\r\n\r\nBen is kinda boring, honestly. He shows interest in Rachel Rozman (Natasha Lyonne) and returning to the places that remind him of what it’s like to feel normal, but unless he’s destroying something or lifting a car over his head, he’s a little forgettable. He isn’t conflicted enough and doesn’t clobber enough things to leave a lasting impression.\r\n\r\nReed and Sue have noticeable chemistry, and they should given that they’re married. And Johnny and Ben have this macho kind of bro energy where they’re always ribbing each other and yet also sarcastically supporting one another (Ben’s beard, Johnny referring to himself in third person). As a foursome and a team, though, they still seem to be lacking, like they’re still learning to coordinate cohesively instead of Reed or Sue calling it on the spot.\r\n\r\nThe film takes place four years after the cosmic storm that caused them to gain their powers. But maybe the “first steps” part of the title refers to them still learning to work together as a team, as well as Franklin’s first baby steps.\r\n\r\nThe visual effects are mostly extremely impressive, with a few noticeable green screen shots and face animations being the only funky inclusions. The Silver Surfer’s face looks awkward at times, like it isn’t properly centered on Julia Garner’s body, or something. I wasn’t a huge fan of how the Human Torch looked either. His body is just orange with some lazy flames at the sides that don’t even cover his entire body.\r\n\r\nThe Silver Surfer chase sequences in the wormhole are some of the best the MCU has ever done. There was a bit of an uproar amongst the internet community when The Silver Surfer turned out to be female in this, but the character is given the coolest moments in the film and arguably the film’s most emotional sequence apart from the film’s finale. It's been apparent since Doctor Strange has been hinting at it in both of his films, but the MCU needs to go fully cosmic for its next phase.\r\n\r\nDespite being beloved around the world and being a team for a decent amount of time, it feels like The Fantastic Four are still working out the kinks of being a solid team in First Steps. The performances are solid, the chemistry amongst the cast is great, and there are sentimental moments sprinkled throughout the entire film. \r\n\r\nThere’s a lot of promise in what the future of the MCU holds with this version of The Fantastic Four, and it’s somewhat of a relief to have a Fantastic Four film that is actually worthwhile and hopefully worth revisiting with fondness instead of regret.",

Nonetheless, the storytelling is captivating and you don’t realize how the 1:30 hr passed. Acting is pretty decent, Pedro Pascal shines in his acting.

  "content": "There’s a distinctive charm to “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” a refreshing, visually inventive take on the MCU formula. Director Matt Shakman brings Marvel’s First Family into a retro-futuristic 1960s setting that makes the movie stand out from the typical summer superhero fare. Shakman delivers a world of bold colors, bubble-helmeted scientists, and sleek, sci-fi tech that’s unexpectedly delightful, if a bit slow moving.\r\n\r\nReed Richards (Pedro Pascal) and his wife Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby) have their first baby on the way. They, along with Reed’s brother-in-law Johnny (Joseph Quinn) and best friend Ben (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), are excited to welcome a new bundle of joy into their home. But when a mysterious woman known as Silver Surfer (Julia Garner) shows up with a dire warning from a ravenous space god called Galactus (Ralph Ineson), Sue and Reed are given an impossible choice: give up their newborn son to save Earth, or let the entire planet be destroyed. \r\n\r\nThis conflict sounds compelling, but it’s also where the film stumbles. Galactus is more of a looming concept than a compelling villain, with motivations that feel too impersonal and very vague. Silver Surfer is a terrific character with an interesting back story, but the movie never quite gives her enough to do. The Four aren’t bogged down with an elaborate origin story either, and it works well here. They’re already established by the time we meet them, which allows for more time spent on character dynamics. I could see how casual audiences who are less familiar with the comic book characters could find the lack of an origin story disappointing, but the actors and their chemistry more than make up for it. \r\n\r\nThe film leans into its “found family” theme with heart and sincerity, placing an emphasis on character over spectacle. The strong performances from the cast boost the film’s overall credibility, and the special effects are (admittedly) top notch. The themes lean heavily on the idea that family is not only biological, but also can be chosen, and there’s a nice balance between the need to be superheroes as well as parents and a strongly bonded family.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is plenty to like here, “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” isn’t a movie I’d ever want to revisit. I can’t honestly say that I’m excited to see any of these characters in future films, and I actually found the Four to be a little bit boring. And while it’s so nice to see a Marvel film that isn’t trying desperately to be forcefully stuffed into some extended universe timeline, the movie doesn’t entirely escape the studio’s usual pitfalls.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

  "content": "Producer-writer-director Jordan Peele has quickly developed quite a reputation for making horror flicks/psychological thrillers that undeniably push the envelope of these genres, turning out creations unlike anything most moviegoers have ever seen. In the process, he has often packed his pictures with much for viewers to process on multiple levels as they walk out of the theater. And, in his latest offering, in which Peele has acted as producer, handing over the writing and directing responsibilities to filmmaker Justin Tipping, he has overseen the birth of yet another release in the same vein as previous projects like “Get Out” (2017), “Us” (2019) and “Nope” (2022) – only this time on steroids and laced with a touch of crack. “Him” tells the story of Cameron Cade (Tyriq Withers), a pro football prospect who’s looked upon by many as the sport’s next quarterback G.O.A.T. (i.e., “greatest of all time”). His future looks bright until he experiences a baffling yet devastating head injury at the hands of disturbed fan teetering on the edge of sanity. So, in an effort to reinvigorate his skills (and to rejuvenate his career), he agrees to be taken under the wing of veteran hurler Isaiah White (Marlon Wayans), a QB who led his team to eight championships but is now on the fence about retirement. When the recovering protégé begins his mentorship under the sports legend, however, he gets much more than he bargained for. He enters a world in which he becomes ensconced in a dizzying mix of hyper-ambition, psychological gamesmanship, professional jealousy and an aberrant culture that gleefully and relentlessly celebrates mind-numbing brutality. Given Cam’s precarious mental state in the wake of his injury, combined with an onslaught of conflicting messages, mind games and bizarre occurrences that straddle the borders of reality, he struggles to make sense of it all, particularly when it comes to deciding whether to embrace or abandon the world of which he’s about to become a part. His existence turns surreal, confusing, and, above all, troubling. He has some big decisions to make, provided if he’s even capable of thinking straight at this point. But the film is about more than just Cam’s struggle to hold on to his sanity in the face of his mentor’s malevolence, gaslighting and questionable motives; it’s also a strong statement about the bloodsport culture of football and the ways in which society has come to worship it as something akin to a perverse religious cult. In fact, the narrative is riddled with ominous Biblical and Satanic symbolism, elements that have been suitably tweaked to reflect the nature of the world of pro football and the exalted position it’s been accorded in contemporary society. Yet, curiously enough, in making its case, the film tells a tale that alternates between being deadly serious with its troubling imagery and not taking itself seriously at all with its astutely timed sinister comic relief, walking a precarious tightrope of moods that keeps viewers guessing about what’s really going on here. In the process, it provides a perfect showcase for Wayans to show off acting chops that most of us probably never knew he possessed; his ability to switch gears and turn on a dime and make it look effortless is truly impressive. Add to those qualities the film’s breakneck pacing, edgy film editing, stunning visuals and eclectic production design, and you’ve got a cinematic rollercoaster that’s sure to leave you exhilarated, exhausted and unnerved by the time the credits roll. Now, this is not to suggest that the film is without problems. The narrative is excessively overstuffed and somewhat unfocused at times (no doubt to try and convey what it’s like to be in Cam’s head under these circumstances), and its various messages can be more than a little obvious and heavy-handed on occasion. However, even if “Him” is not perfect, Tipping and Peele should be commended for trying to breathe new life into a genre that’s been releasing a steady stream of lame, half-baked offerings of late, and I’ll take this offering over any of its underwhelming wannabe peers any day of the week.",

  "content": "We start off watching a young lad glued to the television where his American footballing idol “Isaiah” (Marlon Wayans) is out to set some records. An injury ensues during that game before we spool on until the young lad himself is now a budding superstar (Tyriq Withers) and after he’s been rather brutally thwacked on the head and suffered some brain swelling, his hero invites him to train at his underground desert compound where it becomes very clear that not only did he recover, mysteriously, from his on-field injury many years earlier but that he went on to become a legend of his sport. “Cam” is completely phased by his new opportunity but once he has met his idol, his rather bizarre wife and their enigmatic physician-cum-trainer he becomes increasingly aware that there are more than just the obvious ice baths and sacrifices to be made. Originally, I thought there might be an element of the horror to this. Maybe something along the lines of that Charlie Daniels song? Then I though it was just an excuse for attractive men to glisten up with sweat and wrestle about on the floor? Then I thought I’d forgotten to buy milk - and that’s when I realised that I had no idea what I was watching, nor why. Sure, we get the usual work hard to play hard vibe as well a sense of the dedication and perseverance needed to thrive, but there’s neither much of a plot nor any character development and once you’ve seen Withers in a towel for the tenth time, even that begins to wear (but not come) off. This is a really disappointingly self indulgent piece of cinema that culminates ridiculously and left me cold. Perhaps I just wasn’t in the right mood, but I thought this a waste of ninety minutes.",

Gwi-Ma enslaves other demons and practically tortures them with their shame for all eternity and we end the movie by permanently trapping them all in the demon realm with him? Really? Even though Jinu shows that demons can be redeemed by... showing them kindness and forgiveness?! REALLY?! Okay!\r\n\r\nThe last one is my biggest issue with the plot.\r\n\r\nAs for my issues with the representation of K-pop idols; their lives are only glamorous on the surface. K-pop idols are not born, they're made.\r\n\r\nThese kids go through hell, for lack of a better way to describe it. It's not so much an issue with the K-pop industry itself, as it's a \"cultural\" issue. Koreans push themselves and each other to the brink, and it can and does lead to suicide.\r\n\r\nSouth Korea has one of the highest suicide rates in the world.\r\n\r\nThe movie shows our K-pop protagonists snacking out and enjoying life, when in reality, these kids are on a strict diet and are allegedly not allowed these things.\r\n\r\nI like the movie, but I've read too much about the real lives of K-pop idols to overlook the glamorized misrepresentation shown here.",

  "content": "If a movie franchise has nothing especially new to say about itself or its mythology, perhaps it’s best if it refrains from trying to say anything at all. Such is the case with this latest installment in the “Tron” series of would-be sci-fi screen epics, a nondescript, underwhelming effort that, regrettably, disappoints in myriad ways. What starts out as a generally unengaging tale about AI corporate espionage that straddles life in the real world and cyberspace improves somewhat as it moves along, particularly in the back half when the connection to the original 1982 release becomes more apparent (and more compelling). But what precedes that development is uninspiring, even if it is visually dazzling to look at. Its attempt at conveying a cautionary tale about the potential dangers associated with artificial intelligence (not to mention the greedy, dimwitted purveyors of this dubious technology) may be laudable for its nobility and sincerity, but it’s not especially new at this point given the many other cinematic releases that have already tackled this subject (and better), perhaps best seen in several of the “Terminator” offerings. Arguably, the biggest problem here is an anemic script that generally tries mightily (though not always successfully) to link this picture’s narrative with its seminal roots, but it frequently feels as if it’s reaching for a suitably sufficient tie-in. That’s particularly apparent where a key story element is concerned, one that has been alluded to in previous installments but that is brought up directly this time – and that should have played a far more significant role in this iteration but that, sadly, is largely glossed over when introduced, receiving only scant treatment thereafter. The casting also leaves much to be desired, with gifted character actor Jared Leto being thrust into a part where his performance is about as appealing as a lukewarm bowl of porridge (with few prospects for greater, more meaningful depth and development); protagonist Greta Lee turning in a portrayal lacking in passion, interest and realistic believability; and Jeff Bridges essentially making an extended cameo that he could have just as soon phoned in (though, thankfully, Jodie Turner-Smith and Gillian Anderson are on hand to breathe some much-needed life into the otherwise-lackluster acting). Interestingly, this offering boasts an impressive original score by Nine Inch Nails, but its presence is so undeniable that it often tends to overpower the action that it’s meant to complement (I often found myself listening more intently to the background music than to the on-screen dialogue – an element that really shouldn’t be that obvious). To be honest, I can’t say that I hated director Joachim Rønning’s latest feature outing, but I certainly didn’t love it, either. In fact, the only reason I’d recommend seeing it on a big screen would be for the special effects, and, if that’s not justification enough for you to plunk down your hard-earned money for theater ticket prices, I’d suggest waiting until it comes to streaming and watch it at home.",

  "content": "##A Visually Stunning Sequel That Plays It a Bit Too Safe\r\n\r\nThe Grid awaits once more, and its return is a welcome one. *TRON: Ares*, the long-gestating next chapter in the cult-favourite franchise, delivers exactly what the trailer promises: a breathtaking dive back into a digital world of light-cycle duels and identity-disc battles. It’s a spectacle for the senses that faithfully honors the legacy, even if its human heart sometimes gets lost in the neon glow.\r\n\r\n**The Visuals and Sound Are the Real Stars**\r\n\r\nLet's be clear: this film is worth the price of admission for the aesthetic alone. Building on the foundation laid by *TRON: Legacy*, *Ares* pushes the visual envelope even further. The Grid feels more vast, more detailed, and more dangerous. The signature light-cycle sequences are more visceral and intelligently choreographed, and the disc wars have a satisfying, weighty impact that will please fans. The real standout, however, is the sound design and score. While no one can truly replace Daft Punk, the new musical team (or rumoured guest artists) have crafted a pulsating, electronic heartbeat that seamlessly blends nostalgic tones with fresh, aggressive synth-wave rhythms. It’s a triumph.\r\n\r\n**A Compelling Premise with a Rushed Execution**\r\n\r\nThe story follows Ares (a perfectly cast Jared Leto), a powerful A.I. program sent from the digital world into our human reality—a clever inversion of the first film's premise. The goal is one of peace and understanding, but as any *TRON* fan knows, nothing on The Grid goes according to plan. The philosophical conflict—what happens when a perfect digital consciousness confronts the messy, illogical nature of humanity?—is fertile ground.\r\n\r\nThe film is at its best when exploring this core idea. Leto brings a compelling, otherworldly quality to Ares, making him both empathetic and intimidating. However, the screenplay struggles to balance its high-concept themes with its blockbuster obligations. The human characters, including a weary corporate tech executive (played ably by a under-utilised Jodie Turner-Smith), often feel like narrative devices to move the plot along rather than fully fleshed-out people. The third act, in particular, rushes toward a climactic battle that, while visually spectacular, resolves the film's central philosophical dilemma a bit too neatly.\r\n\r\n**A Worthy, if Flawed, Entry**\r\n\r\n*TRON: Ares* doesn't reach the iconic status of the original nor the cult-cool heights of *Legacy*. It feels like a carefully crafted, slightly safe attempt to reignite the franchise. It does so with immense style and a clear love for the source material, but it stumbles in giving its human elements the same depth and complexity as its digital ones.\r\n\r\n**The Verdict: 7/10**\r\n\r\n*TRON: Ares* is a solid and entertaining sci-fi adventure. It delivers stunning visuals, a thumping score, and enough classic *TRON* action to satisfy devotees. While its story doesn't fully explore the profound questions it raises, it successfully opens a new door to The Grid, leaving you hopeful and eager for the next round.\r\n\r\n**See it if:** You're a fan of the franchise; you crave a big-screen visual and auditory experience; you enjoy high-concept sci-fi, even when it prioritises spectacle over depth.\r\n**Skip it if:** You demand deep character development from your blockbusters; you have no prior connection to the *TRON* universe.",

It lacks tension and doesn't really captivate you, not even in the most dramatic moments (which you can tell from the music).\r\n\r\nAnd when the plot finally progresses, it stil is sloooow and spells out everything (of the clichés). What became of \"show, don't tell\"?\r\n\r\nSolid enough work by all the departments, including actors; but production, script and direction dropped the ball here.\r\n\r\nNot worth the time.",

  "content": "Considerable chatter has been devoted in recent years to the question of whether the movie industry is producing too many superhero/action-adventure films. Much of that talk has specifically focused on whether certain franchises/mythologies have been overdone. That’s particularly true where the “Superman” mythos is concerned, a body of work that has assumed multiple forms on TV and the big screen since the 1970s. And, after viewing this latest iteration involving this storied and much beloved character, I can’t help but concur with the opinion that the man from the planet Krypton needs to be given a serious rest for a while. In my opinion, what has been called the biggest disappointment of this summer’s blockbuster season is an assessment that’s, unfortunately, right on target. In short, writer-director James Gunn’s latest is a hot mess that strains viewer interest not long into its overlong 2:09:00 runtime (a duration that honestly feels even longer than the official tally) and never manages to get it back. The biggest problem here rests with an overstuffed narrative that at times becomes challenging to follow, thanks to a screenplay that’s loaded with incongruities, rampant assumptions and a noticeable lack of back story; film editing tediously in need of much-needed snipping; overreliance on comic relief that grows progressively tiresome (especially with Superman’s annoyingly overzealous canine pal, Krypto); and an overall production whose vision is both tedious and not particularly original (especially in the rather ho-hum action sequences that we’ve seen so many, many times before in better films, most notably those from the Marvel Universe). In addition, the picture’s attempts at updating the nature of the Superman mythology for the present day are uneven at best, including some elements that are sufficiently contemporary with others that are woefully anachronistic (e.g., why are elements involving The Daily Planet newspaper portrayed in much the same way as they were in the past, given that today’s journalism business is a very different animal from what it was years ago?). To its credit, the film’s attempts at evolving the protagonist’s character into a paragon of “wokeness” (a source of much criticism in some circles) provides an intriguing spin on the nature of the Man of Steel – one very much in line with Superman’s traditional embodiment as a champion of “truth, justice and the American way” – even if it is somewhat excessive on occasion. That’s especially true where matters involving “aliens” (like Kal El himself) are symbolically demonized as threats to society, a less-than-subtle allusion to how many perceive today’s immigrants. However, the attempt at making the film’s hero more socially relevant is at times undermined by inconsistent character development, a problem that plagues many of this release’s other players, too. And that’s unfortunate in light of the performances on display, including a capable Christopher Reeve-esque portrayal by the film’s lead (David Corenswet), as well as fine supporting characterizations of mythology staples Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan) and Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult). In essence, though, “Superman” regrettably feels like an offering created by committee, a production that desperately should have gone through several more rounds of revisions before being committed to a final print. What’s more, if this picture was meant to lead off a new franchise involving this character, it comes up short all around, a prospect that doesn’t bode particularly well for the artistic future of this series. Superman deserves better than this, but that’s noticeably lacking in this release, one that, over time, is likely to become forgettable, particularly when measured against its superior predecessors, films that commendably and authentically depict its protagonist as a genuinely super-man.",

  "content": "First of all i would like to say that this isnt a bad movie by any means. In fact there's actually a lot to enjoy here and is easily the BEST live-action Superman movie since the Christopher Reeve era.\r\n\r\nCorenswet as Superman/Clark is fucking amazing and the characterization of Supes would've been perfect if it weren't for that one plot twist (more on that later). I also like that thay made a point but its more on his ACTIONS that define who you are. Hoult is also spectacular, you can just feel his hate and anger and those nasty little evil smirks everytime he wins against our boy in blue. Rachel Brosnahan is also fucking perfect as Lois Lane and her interactions with not only Clark but also the Justice Gang is pure comic Lois. And to top it all of, the action, score, and visual imagery are all very much comic book-esque and just straight up fucking beautiful to see. (Mr Terrific and Metamorpho are both so good and entertaining).\r\n\r\nBUT there is one big twist here that 90% of the general audience won't care about, but as a comic fan the twist just brings this movie down from like a 8-9/10 to a 6-7/10. That twist is just that BAD atleast for someone like me who is a big big Superman comic fan.\r\n\r\nSPOILERS FROM NOW ON:\r\n\r\nNow for the big plot twist. Making the House of El (Jor El and Lara) evil and Superman believing himself to be more human than alien was a really really bad choice. As i mentioned before, i know that the whole point is that Kal or Superman or Clark is more defined by his ACTIONS rather than his heritage. But to make them completely evil and have clark reject his heritage at the end (completely replacing his krypton parents with footage from his earth parents) just really sucks.\r\n\r\nFIRST OF ALL the decision to make them evil just ruins the immigrant allegory. If you've read the comics you would know that Clark is a deeply lonely guy. Having to grow up knowing you're an alien, is different from everyone else and would constantly need to hide his powers and true self. He is afraid of being REJECTED and is the reason why he constantly yearns for his home planet krypton, a place where he could actually feel like himself and not some outsider. So to make his whole origin planet evil?? is not really helping the immigrant allegory. Like imagine if your an immigrant to the USA and suddenly in the news everyone says that your home country and everyone from there is fucking evil. STRAIGHT UP XENOPHOBIA. And to say that Clark wouldn't care about his parents and origin planet because he didnt know them is stupid. I think that Learning your father was a man who tried but failed to save a world that wouldn't listen to him would definitely have an impact on a guy who's trying to save the world everyday.\r\n\r\nA comic issue that showcased his loneliness and fear of rejection from humans is ACTION COMICS #794 where we see Clark in his adolescence watching a film with his friends, wherein the aliens are the villains and everyone around him js cheering for the aliens to go back to their planets. Imagine the pain and loneliness you would feel knowing that everyone around you even your friends just want you to go the fuck away.\r\n\r\nAlso this is exactly why his origin needs to be truly adapted because thats where his character, morality, and such really shine. It's not only where his identity crisis and loneliness are explicitly explored but also where we see that it is not only his actions that define him but also the synthesis of all his experiences juggling his alien and human side. It also adds layers to his eventual rivalry with Lex, and shows his relationship with other super powered beings like the Legion.\r\n\r\nIn relation to that, this is also why SUPERBOY is important to be shown/adapated because its with his heroics as a teen that led to him meeting other heroes mainly the Legion of Superheroes. His adventures with the Legion is where he truly finds who he is, because like him they're also teens going through the same problems. With the legion he finally got a community where he doesn't have to hide anything, can share his problems that no other human can get and most importantly feel less LONELY and feel VALIDATED knowing that a future where superpowered beings are accepted actually exist.\r\n\r\n(Also quick side note, this is also why him dating and losing his virginity to mermaid Lori Lemaris is so important to me. Sex and Intimacy is often done with someone you can be vulnerable with, and a mermaid or another kryptonian Lyra Lerrol be his first time is just so fitting. ADAPT SUPERBOY AND LORI PLEASE)\r\n\r\nHim yearning for his kryptonian heritage also doesnt make him less human. Because why else would he still choose and create his secret identity/persona Clark Kent if he wants to reject it. Clark is his own guilty little pleasure of living as a human because even if he is an alien it shows that he still enjoys earth and cherishes humanity and its culture. He is supposed to be the BEST of both worlds and having him be one sided makes him a FAR LESS interesting character.\r\n\r\nAgain im going to reiterate this making him more human just removes too much LAYERS.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why his origin needs to be adapted is his relationship with Lex Luthor. In Smallville and other iconic comics such as Birthright, Secret Origin, and most recently Last Days of Lex. In these stories a young clark is often shown to have a brief childhood friendship with Lex. Like Clark, Lex always felt alone as a child. He was a science nut and was always interested in the larger universe of extra terrestrials and the like. People constantly saw and bullied him as a weird freak, and everytime he tried to help others people would just reject him. Clark was the only one who tolerated and protected him leading to their \"friendship\"\r\nBut Lex's obsession with the larger universe led to his failed experiment and eventual downfall. He tried to create a machine to find and/or communicate with extra terrestrial life but it exploded and almost killed a ton of people. This led to further rejection from the people of Smallville and made him think that people would always see him as a freak just because he thought bigger and wanted to create science for a better tomorrow. This rejection then of course made him angry, resentful, and didnt care who he stepped on as long as he got his way.\r\n\r\nAnd Clark feels guilty, because if Clark just told him who he really was then maybe Lex wouldn't have turned out evil. If Lex just had a friend who not only matched his intellect but also understood his experiences of being outcasted and then maybe, just maybe both of them together could have used their powers to save and create a better tomorrow for everyone. With this context in mind the rivalry becomes more complex. Superman isnt trying to just stop Lex simply because he's evil. He's also just trying to save his friend.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot more things that i dont like in the film but this where my main points really stop. My other complaints like Jimmy not being a weird lovable dork enough (he's just too regular) and most of the Daily Planet just being caricatures of their comic selves and Clark just having one scene are all really minor nitpicks that can be solved with future movies and adventures.\r\n\r\nBut again as i said in the beginning despite all my long ass complaints there's still a lot to enjoy in this film. And i cannot deny that there is clearly heart in here and is easily still the best Supes movie since Christopher Reeve. It's just the Evil Els that really ruined it for me.\r\n\r\nLASTLY Kara having a cameo at the end kinda breaks the movie in half. Like bro, if you really think the El's are evil then why do you still like your cousin? why do you still wear the House of El logo? like bro your cousin is a living example of the footage being straight up wrong lol.\r\n\r\nLook, it may look like im a hater right now but i genuinely just wanted to love this movie. There are so much scenes here that made the comic book fan in me just smile and cheer like crazy. But the flaws were just way too big for me and it really muddled my experience. I just want Superman, my favorite comic character of all time to be adapted well. And yes while this is definitely the best Adaptation since 1978, it just didn't hit for me. If you're a comic fan or just a movie fan in general im sure you'll still find enjoyment in this because the whole movie is still very fuckin endearing and action packed. But yeah for now, im sticking to the comics. Peace.",

  "content": "<em>'Superman'</em> is the best Supes film that I've seen - and I highly enjoyed 2013's <em>'Man of Steel'</em>, so that is actually saying something. I was surprised at how great this 2025 edition is, like at no point was I ever doubting what I was seeing - it's a fab 2hrs.\r\n\r\nI had seen snippets from a few trailers for this and, in truth, wasn't really vibing with it back then. The lead actor seemed a bit underwhelming, the dialogue felt lousy and Lex Luthor came across over the top. I'm pleased to say, none of those things are true.\r\n\r\nDavid Corenswet is an ace Superman, he fits the role to perfection. Again, I did like Henry Cavill's stint as the eponymous Kryptonian, though I do reckon Corenswet does ever so slightly outdo him. It's silly of me to even compare to be honest, given my appreciation for both.\r\n\r\nFor me, Nicholas Hoult is just as big a plus. This is the best of him I've seen, given I've never been fully convinced. Don't get me wrong, I've liked performances from him, but almost always with an asterisk of sorts attached in my mind. No such issues here, he is fantastic as Lex.\r\n\r\nRachel Brosnahan and Edi Gathegi also dazzle, the latter's character is especially interesting as I never knew he existed before this - hope to see more! Anthony Carrigan, Nathan Fillion and Isabela Merced also manage to stick out, which is impressive. All those onsceen are good.\r\n\r\nThe story is a surpremely entertaining one. I like how they skipped over the origins of Superman, the vast majority of viewers already know the backstory so it's not needed - and for those that don't, a simple short overview, as seen here, is more than enough to get the point across.\r\n\r\nAs for everthing else? The pacing, the visuals, the special effects, the music... all excellent. I, somewhat unexpectedly, have zero issues with this one, I thoroughly had fun with it and would happily revisit it at any time.",

  "content": "Putting all else aside, James Gunn's \"Superman\" succeed's because it adopts a comfortably familiar, wholly \"likeable\", approach.\r\n\r\nThis film borrows heavily from the 70's Superman franchise. Its look, its feel, right down to costumes, harks back to that era. As does, the very simple, down to earth main character, capably played by  David Corenswet. I personally, could not but recall Christoper Reeve, in his performance.\r\n\r\nThis is Superman as he was mean't to be. No cynicism, no divisive woke politics, just a good guy doing his best. Its this innately appealing character and those around him, that make this film function. Because lets be honest, whilst its an entertaining romp, the script is, in my estimation \"chaotic\". Its literally all over the place, doing too many things at once. That said, if you view those scenes in isolation, a good portion, are both enjoyable and amusing. For example, Lex Luthor, getting his comeuppance, from Superman's cousins, kooky Superdog. \r\n\r\nIn summary, no \"Superman\" 2025 is not a perfect film. That said, in a world that's become cynical and divisive, the simple, honest, likeability of this film shines though in a way that's impossible to ignore. For my money, well worth a look.",

  "content": "I know I’m swimming against the tide here, but I just didn’t really rate this. I suppose it was only a matter of time before “Superman” got dragged (literally) into the multiverse. This time it is the DC one that’s being used by the evil “Lex Luthor” (Nicholas Hoult) who has quite a grudge against our red-caped hero. That’s because “Soop” (David Corensweet) recently intervened in a war to assist a small agrarian nation from being invaded by it’s nasty militarised neighbour. With access to his enormous resources, “Luthor” manages to penetrate the secret Antarctic fortress of our well-meaning protector to find not only his deepest secrets but also to kidnap his energetic dog “Krypto” - thus luring his quarry into the aforementioned “pocket universe” where the ultimate super-max prison contains many whom the planet doesn’t know what do do with any more, and a few ex-girlfriends. What chance he can escape through a complex sequence of portals (think “Stargate”)? Well that is largely down to his tenacious on/off girlfriend “Lois” (Rachel Brosnahan) who is entirely aware of her beau’s double identity, and to a tech whizz (Edi Gathegi) from another group of meta humans called the “Justice Gang” run by the “Green Lantern” who occasionally help out when the relentless stream of aliens descend on Metropolis. Now the scene is set for a really weak, repetitious and entirely derivative series of thwack and pow adventures that had me looking at the ceiling just once too often. Gene Hackman was always going to take some beating as “Luthor” but why use a British actor at all, and then make him use an entirely unnecessary American accent before giving him lines that make him sound like a frenzied bingo-caller? What’s with the dog? Aw, bless, but really? It just goes to show how remarkably ordinary “Superman” has become in a world so completely dominated by technology and people with far greater superpowers. Corensweet tries quite hard, is easy on the eye and he has some charm to him, but nobody else really has enough to get their teeth into and just by shaving Hoult’s head you don’t make him menacing. He isn’t in the least. There is cheesy sentiment all over this CGI-fest of a film that has a passing similarity to Ezra Miller’s “The Flash” from 2023. Sure, it moves along quickly but when you start to create cracks in what made a superhero super in the first place, you have to be able to infill with some serious attempts at action characterisation - not slushy dog-loving, baby/girlfriend-saving ones. No such development happens here and after the final denouement - there are a few goes at that - I left the cinema thinking this was an huge victory for style over substance and that this fella isn’t so much super as flawed: physically and emotionally. That wasn’t what I wanted to see. It’s a family film that can offend no-one and that looks great on a big screen, but I was distinctly disappointed, sorry.",

  "content": "The version of Superman in James Gunn’s film differs from past film iterations of the character. In other films, Superman is a one-man powerhouse. He is the only one who can save the day, and there is no plan B if he happens to lose. Maybe other heroes exist in that cinematic universe, but a major team doesn’t come together until a later film, and those other heroes are busy keeping people safe in their neck of the woods.\r\n\r\nIn the 2025 version of Superman, the film begins with Superman losing for the first time. The story Gunn wants to tell is how Kal-El faces the challenge of not only losing, but continuing to lose nearly everything that he holds dear. Superman gets his ass kicked throughout the film and barely scrapes by in fights.\r\n\r\nSuperman reintroduces color to superhero films after what felt like an eternity of a more serious comic book movie era, where everything tried to be serious and washed out in color. Superman feels like opening an old issue of Action Comics or a Superman comic from the 90s. Colors are bright and radiant to an extent that feels almost cartoonish, like a comic book.\r\n\r\nLex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult) has a plan that results in the entire world turning on Superman and Luthor being in control of the United States when it comes to interacting with metahumans (humans with superpowers) and whether they pose a threat or not. Superman disappears after being taken captive, and it’s up to Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan) and Mister Terrific (Edi Gathegi) to save him.\r\n\r\nI’ve never been a huge fan of Superman. The original 1978 film, Zack Snyder’s Man of Steel, and Superman: The Animated Series from the late 90s are the highlights of the character for me. In Gunn’s film, David Corenswet doesn’t specifically add anything new to the character that we haven’t seen before. That’s not ragging on Corenswet’s performance, but it seems to be how the Superman character is.\r\n\r\nHe is a god among men, and the thing that makes him special is that he not only cares about the human race, but also views himself as human, because despite being an alien, he also makes mistakes. Corenswet delivers that bold sense of hope Superman is known for and is the embodiment of the modern version of the character.\r\n\r\nIt feels like Gunn knew that Superman’s straightforward demeanor couldn’t carry the film, and that’s one of the reasons why he surrounded him with so many supporting characters. Gunn has made a career of giving the spotlight to losers, outcasts, and characters who never should work together but are either forced to or feel like the family they’ve never been able to have once they’re all together.\r\n\r\nLex Luthor has a short fuse in this film, but that fuse turned to ash eons ago. He is seething with his hatred for Superman. He is envious of Superman’s popularity, but also hates the fact that he isn’t from this planet. Nicholas Hoult goes completely unhinged in his performance, but the scary aspect is that the average person can either see red and let themselves give in to rage or think logically and sensibly while thinking about what comes next. Lex not only does both of those things in Superman, but he is almost always two or three steps ahead of everyone else in the film.\r\n\r\nUltraman and The Engineer (Maria Gabriela de Faria) work for Lex Luthor and do all of the heavy lifting and fighting for Lex. The Engineer has a suit made from nanotechnology, while drones operated by drones control Ultraman to do Lex’s bidding. The Justice Gang – consisting of Guy Gardner (Nathan Fillion), Mister Terrific, and Hawkgirl (Isabela Merced) – handles heroic matters when Superman has his hands full. Guy is this universe’s version of Green Lantern, Mister Terrific is an inventor who uses his high-tech gadgets to fight crime, and Hawkgirl can fly and swing heavy weapons or something.\r\n\r\nThe film devotes a huge portion of its story to Ultraman, while The Engineer and Hawkgirl are strong female characters without much to do. The inclusion of The Engineer is said to be building towards a film centered around The Authority, but Hawkgirl is kind of forgettable as a character. She has a memorable scene near the end of the film, but the character as a whole isn’t developed at all.\r\n\r\nFor a James Gunn film, the humor is toned way down in comparison to his other films. Nathan Fillion’s Guy Gardner embodies Gunn’s typical comedy with a charming sense of juvenile obnoxiousness that you can’t help but love. Gunn’s other films, specifically the Guardians of the Galaxy films and the Suicide Squad, were fueled by constant bickering. There’s a sequence where Lois interviews Clark as Superman that feels like it’s attempting to add weight to Gunn’s fascination with comedic arguing and succeeds for the most part.\r\n\r\nMetamorpho (Anthony Carrigan) is one of the more unique characters with some of the most visually impressive sequences in the film, and Krypto is a national treasure. It’s wild that Jimmy Olsen (Skyler Gisondo) is the biggest player of Metropolis, as every woman wants a piece of that.\r\n\r\nJames Gunn’s Superman rips the hope away from Superman and focuses on the real possibility of him not being able to save the day or even be the hero that people want to save them. Superman can eventually overcome impossible odds, but it’s earned, and nearly every supporting character is given the chance to contribute.\r\n\r\nSuperman is goofy, hopeless, and rewarding in all of the best ways. Some characters aren’t given as much time as others, but it feels like James Gunn is attempting to build a DC Universe full of interesting characters that are not only worthy of being on screen but deserve to be there.",

The entire cast is phenomenal, but newcomer Chase Infiniti is a true revelation, delivering a captivating and emotionally powerful performance that perfectly embodies the theme of generational hope.\r\n\r\nWhile I don't share the hyperbole generated by the initial reactions, it's clearly one of the most important and well-made films of the year. Driven by a masterful score and a sharp script from Paul Thomas Anderson, where every detail matters, it's a dense story about the battles we cannot escape and the family we fight for.\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

  "content": "The undisputed film of the year has only been in theaters for 4 days, yet it has already captivated audiences and critics alike, and not without reason. Amidst hundreds of mediocrities released every year, a film finally emerges that emphatically has something to say. And indeed, at the most suitable social and historical moment.\r\n\r\nThe film narrates the lives of people who chose to take action against the man-eating capitalist system of the 21st century, which inevitably degenerates into a fascist regime when reactions grow. And primarily, it focuses on the consequences these individuals face from the vengeful state apparatus, which sweeps away anything and anyone who dares to oppose it.\r\n\r\nThe film was released in theaters on September 26, 2025, before the first year of Donald Trump's second presidential term was even completed, and more than 3 years before the next presidential elections. Paul Thomas Anderson (PTA), writing and directing One Battle After Another, takes a clear political stance on what is happening in the United States and globally. The film may take place in the US, but it does not focus on specific individuals, not even as institutions, and thus could refer to any country where democracy is ailing.\r\n\r\nThe mastery of direction and the musical score is such that time flows relativistically quickly for the viewer, making the nearly 3-hour duration evaporate before you realize you’ve entered the theater. From a directorial perspective, new pages of cinematic history have been written, culminating in the car chase on the hilly Texas Dip highway of Borrego Springs. The performances of the exceptional cast are all very good, without any one standing out as Oscar-worthy. Sean Penn once again showcases his talent in the role of the villain, possessing the unique gift of becoming truly unlikable to the viewer in such roles (see Carlito’s Way, etc.).\r\n\r\nHowever, the essence and power of the film is undoubtedly its political message. Through the vehicle of fiction, Paul Thomas Anderson releases his political manifesto, which leaves no room for misinterpretation. From the title of the film to the shot of DiCaprio watching the film \"The Battle of Algiers\" by Gillo Pontecorvo, the message is clear. When democracy and individual freedoms are under attack, citizens must take action. In contrast, however, to \"The Battle of Algiers,\" where we observe, in part, historical events that took place during Algeria's liberation struggle against French imperialism, in Anderson's film we become spectators of events that have not yet occurred, at least not in the United States. Yes, protests, and indeed massive ones, have taken place and are happening more frequently lately. But the film One Battle After Another does not propose sit-ins and placards as a solution. On the contrary, it primarily serves as a manual on the \"how:. The \"when\", is still unknown. One thing is certain. American society is boiling. And some are preparing. On both sides.",

  "content": "A group of would-be revolutionaries in the USA storm an immigration centre and whilst they manage to free many of it’s captives, their leader “Perfidia” (Teyana Taylor) manages to make quite an impression on it’s commander “Lockjaw” (Sean Penn). Sadly for her though, she doesn’t remain free for very long afterwards but in that meantime she and fellow rebel “Bob” (Leonardo DiCaprio) have managed to have a baby. Spool on and now she is a teenager living quietly with her dad, entirely unaware of her dangerous provenance. “Lockjaw” has no intention of forgetting the slight paid to him, and when he cottons on to their location he sends in his heavies. She is apprehended, he escapes, and the rest of this follows his adventures as he tries to mobilise his old friends and rescue his daughter “Willa” (Chase Infiniti). Now this looks great, the pace is pretty break-neck and the dialogue is quick-fire and frequently quite pithy as we merge a series of scenarios that reminded me of the “A-Team”. DiCaprio looks like he is enjoying himself, as does Penn, but both of their characters and the underlying conspiratorial plot are disappointingly undercooked as the adventure builds and to it’s high octane conclusion. Does it really need to be so long? I’m not so sure. It does come across as a little disjointedly episodic at times but it is also politically bang-on (depending on your perspective) as it capitalises on currently salient points around immigration, corporatisation and militarisation. I didn’t love it and I do think it has been over-hyped, but it’s still a solidly entertaining watch.",

  "content": "Whenever a film playing in theaters is introduced by one of the members of the picture’s creative team, it’s a safe bet that it doesn’t live up to its pre-release hype. (Indeed, in all the years I’ve watched movies theatrically, that’s been the case every time with just two exceptions.) And, regrettably, that’s very much the case in this final installment in this long-running franchise. To put it simply, “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning” is an offering with a lot of problems, the biggest of which being the decision to split the story into two parts in the first place. As it stands, the narrative could have easily been condensed down to a single release. But, if the producers truly wanted to make two films to close out the franchise, they could have readily done so by making two distinct stand-alone pictures instead of trying to tie this offering to its predecessor, “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning, Part One” (2023), considering that the nexus between them is tepid at best. As a consequence, though, this two-film package makes for a needlessly long 5½-hour story that could have been told in much less time with some judicious editing. This suggests that milking the box office had to have been a strong incentive for how this project ultimately played out. And, even if that wasn’t the case, the least the creators could have done was to tell a better story: While the first part did a reasonably capable job of holding viewer interest, that’s out the window here with its many well-crafted but decidedly overlong action sequences (a la the most recent “Indiana Jones” offering (2023)); a story that elevates comparatively minor characters to unexplained relevance; under-utilizes the talents of several gifted cast members (e.g., Nick Offerman and Janet McTeer) while leaving others out entirely (where’s Vanesa Kirby’s White Widow, a character who played a key role in the first part?); and requires comprehensive audience familiarity with both the franchise’s complete mythology, as well as in-depth knowledge of the intricacies of AI technology. Most importantly, however, many plot elements of the picture go beyond being “impossible” to “wholly implausible” or even “difficult to accept,” with numerous scenes that are full of holes, rely on convenient contrivances or seem completely unfathomable. “Final Reckoning” even “borrows” elements from other movie narratives (most notably “Fail Safe” (1964) and “Terminator 2: Judgment Day” (1991)) that strain its efforts at originality. There’s also an almost self-congratulatory aspect to the production thanks to the inclusion of numerous flashback clips to previous installments in the franchise, introduced with somewhat tangential tie-ins, a cinematic stroll down memory lane that adds little (the film’s inspired reintroduction and effective use of CIA operative William Donloe (Rolf Saxon) from the franchise’s first release (1996) notwithstanding). In the end, however, this release misses the mark in myriad ways, and that even includes a rather lame conclusion that comes across as stretched out and unsatisfyingly anticlimactic (and that could have been handled better and differently in several alternate scenarios). In my view, this collection of blatant shortcomings is not the way to wrap up a storied franchise like this. I firmly believe that it should have come to an end with the release of “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” (2018), handily the best of the eight features in this series. Indeed, going to the well one (or two!) too many times can tarnish a mythology’s legacy, and “Mission: Impossible” is one such venture. It genuinely deserves to go out with a bang and not a whimper. Unfortunately, though, in this case, the latter is the reality, and that’s truly a shame.",

Quickly, though, we are reminded that the entity (anyone see the “Forbin Project” from 1970?) is bent on seizing control of the world’s nuclear arsenals and using them to start a process of mutually assured destruction that will eradicate all life on Earth. Luckily “Ethan” (Cruise) has the magic key that might lead to humanity’s salvation, but he also needs the support of his erstwhile bosses, the President of the USA, an aircraft carrier and a nuclear submarine that actually works. Once we have waded through all the recaps the story kicks in with plenty of opportunity for our ingenious hero and his team - largely without Ving Rhames this time - to put together a series of cunning plays and counter-plays to keep themselves ahead of not just the megalomaniacal virus but also the malevolent “Gabriel” (Esai Morales) who reckons he might be able to take control. It’s essentially a vehicle for the star for the supporting efforts from the likes of Hayley Atwell and Simon Pegg offer us little of distinction, but if you’re a fan of action adventure movies then this is the equivalent of a higher-tech “Indiana Jones” movie with car chases; loads of pyrotechnics; great visual effects, an energetic score and it culminates with an enjoyable aerial dogfight that just needed the Red Baron and/or Sir Sean Connery. I am struggling to believe this is really the last of these, but if it is then it’s a fitting denouement for a character that has largely delivered well these last thirty years and that has has come along way from the Peter Graves stuff from the late 1960s. It does need a big screen as it will look very ordinary on the television, but even though it is probably half an hour longer than it needs to be, is still a good watch.",

Its regrettable then that I can't find anything overly positive to say about \"Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning.\" \r\n\r\nI found the script for this film incoherent. From a storytelling perspective, it wanders about like a inebriated night clubber on a Saturday night. Its not helped either by a  weak core premise and villains who are, put simply, really none too interesting.\r\n\r\nOn the upside Cruise does his best and the action scenes are polished, as you would expected from a big budget film.\r\n\r\nIn summary, to my mind the least inspiring film, in the Mission Impossible franchise.

  "content": "My quick rating - 7.2/10. You’d think a 170-minute movie would have plenty of time to waste, but Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning sprints out of the gate and doesn’t look back. For something that clocks in at nearly three hours, it’s almost shocking how quickly it moves. The story is intricate, packed with moving parts, but still surprisingly easy to follow. Credit goes to the sharp editing that threads everything together without losing momentum. It’s clear the filmmakers wanted this to feel like the culmination of Ethan Hunt’s thirty-year journey, and in many ways, they pull it off—though maybe not quite as hard-hitting as one might expect from a grand finale.\r\n\r\nOf course, the real selling point here is the action. Tom Cruise once again takes every opportunity to play Mr. Show-Off with his stunt work, and honestly, I’m not mad about it. Whether it’s leaping off impossible heights, riding vehicles where no sane person would, or holding his breath longer than a Navy SEAL, Cruise continues to prove he’s Hollywood’s most committed daredevil. Sure, the Fast and Furious franchise gets ribbed for ridiculous, physics-defying set pieces, but let’s not kid ourselves—the Mission: Impossible films are guilty of the exact same thing. The difference is, these stunts are both insane and staged so well you can’t help but buy in.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking. There are shots here that are simply jaw-dropping, and the underwater submarine sequence is a masterclass in tension. It’s one of those rare moments where I completely forgot the film’s narrative hiccups because I was so locked in. This is the kind of spectacle that demands the biggest screen possible, and it delivers on that front without question.\r\n\r\nThat said, there are issues. For one, the script leans heavily on exposition, so much so that I occasionally wanted to yell, “Enough talking, just throw Tom Cruise off another cliff already!” And while it’s fun to see familiar faces like Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg return, the film introduces so many additional characters that several of them feel like nothing more than pawns shuffled around the board. They’re there to keep the plot moving, not to give us anyone new to root for.\r\n\r\nThen there’s the villain problem. Gabriel, played by Esai Morales, makes for a sinister presence, but his routine is frustratingly repetitive. He shows up, threatens or mansplains something, then disappears until the next scene, where he does the same thing again. It’s hard to feel the weight of the supposed ultimate adversary when his menace keeps fading into the background.\r\n\r\nAnd that brings me to the finale. For a movie carrying the subtitle “The Final Reckoning,” it doesn’t quite land the emotional haymaker I was expecting. It’s still thrilling, still entertaining, but it doesn’t pack the kind of gut punch you’d hope for from the end of a thirty-year saga.\r\n\r\nEven with those flaws, I can’t deny this is a wildly entertaining blockbuster. The tension, the stunts, the sheer spectacle—it’s everything you’d expect from a Mission: Impossible film, even if it stops just shy of greatness. Respect where it’s due: Tom Cruise keeps raising the bar, and for that alone, this ride is worth taking.",

  "content": "Seventeen children ran out of their homes one night at 2:17 am. They ran into the street and disappeared into the darkness. They all attend Maybrook Elementary, and all of them were from Justine Gandy’s (Julia Garner) class. The one student who didn’t leave was Alex Lilly (Cary Christopher), who is now quieter and reserved than ever. \r\n\r\nParents of the missing children, including Archer Graff (Josh Brolin), believe that Justine Gandy either had something to do with it or knows where they are. Things turn hostile, and people begin dying in gruesome ways as this seemingly cursed town scrambles for answers. \r\n\r\nIn 2022, writer and director Zach Cregger wowed audiences and critics with Barbarian. Now Cregger returns with Weapons, a film with a bigger budget, bigger stars, and a more intricate story that intertwines horror, drama, and comedy. \r\n\r\nHow the children are disappearing can be solved relatively easily while researching the film online, but it’s best to go in blind. Half the charm of Weapons is riding through the mystery as it unravels because it takes some violent and unexpected detours. The film is told through the perspectives of five individuals: Justine, Archer, a cop named Paul (Alden Ehrenreich) who has a complicated relationship with Justine, Alex, and a drug addict named James (Austin Abrams). \r\n\r\nWeapons isn’t as shocking or as scary as Barbarian. There are still moments of extreme gore and several moments that take you off guard, but the creepiest parts of Weapons are nightmares that Justine or Archer has. The unsettling sensation is there, but the fact that you know that these are nightmares and the film chooses not to hide that in the slightest makes its impact less potent. \r\n\r\nEverything in Weapons is tied to Alex’s aunt Gladys (Amy Madigan). Gladys is incredibly sick and comes to stay with Alex and his parents. She wears a bright red wig, puts on entirely too much red lipstick, and wears vibrant, colored clothes. If it wasn’t for her pale, wrinkly, and sickly looking frame, she’d have a clown-like appearance. She appears in the dreams Justine and Archer are having, and there’s a reason for that. \r\n\r\nThe film is surprisingly funny. There are several laugh-out-loud moments sprinkled throughout the film, but James is in the film for several important reasons. His motivation is simple for a guy who is constantly tweaking, as he is constantly trying to make money as quickly as he can to get to his next fix. He becomes the comedic catalyst for Paul, and his audible reactions as he’s caught on multiple occasions are amusing. James is the main comic relief of Weapons, but he also stumbles onto the first strong lead of what happened to the missing children. \r\n\r\nCamera placement is interesting in weapons as it’s constantly behind the actors. You notice body language more while staring at someone’s back, and it also makes it feel like you’re either following or chasing them the entire film. There’s also an emphasis on doors. There is a specific door to a specific house in the film that is just as threatening closed as it is open. From the outside looking in, there’s no difference. So the threat of not knowing what’s inside and what’s on the other side of that door is always there. \r\n\r\nWeapons expands upon Zach Cregger’s storytelling and directing capabilities and offers what is arguably the biggest crowd-pleasing finale of any film this year. It’s much more layered and caters to more than just one specific audience, like Barbarian did. There’s gore and tension, humorous interactions, and the character drama in between keeps you interested throughout. \r\n\r\nIt’s a well-written and unpredictable story, but it also feels like something is missing. It could be that it isn’t straightforward horror or that its reputation has built it up a bit too much. Weapons is a bonkers mystery that is worth seeing, and Zach Cregger is as bold as ever as a filmmaker, but it simply doesn’t leave you with that same sense of being completely blown away like after viewing Barbarian for the first time.",

  "content": "\"WEAPONS\" strikes the perfect balance between visceral horror and psychological discomfort. The deeply unsettling premise stems from the simultaneous disappearance of nearly all the students in a class (except one) in a single night, without explanation, creating a constant tension in the narrative. Zach Cregger, in his dual role as director and screenwriter, creates a web of parallel narratives that intertwine with precision, proving emotionally powerful and insidious in its construction of mystery.\r\n\r\nThe cast - especially Julia Garner as teacher Justine, Josh Brolin in a tormented fatherly role, and Amy Madigan as a sinister, mythical figure - infuses the characters with depth and dramatic intensity.\r\n\r\nThe technical quality is on par with the performances: Larkin Seiple's cinematography imbues the most disturbing scenes with an almost supernatural light, while the editing pace maintains suspense without resorting to easy solutions. The film doesn't just scare; it makes us think, reflect, and feel the growing panic in the community it portrays.\r\n\r\nOverall, \"WEAPONS\" stands out as a sophisticated and ambitious thriller that goes far beyond conventional horror. Its approach, anchored in symbolic realism and imbued with metaphorical violence, stands as a social and psychological commentary on the contemporary climate of paranoia, evoking, without explicitly stating, echoes of real school tragedies. The tension builds organically and culminates in a brutal climax, yet consistent with the entire preceding development. It's a remarkable cinematic experience, one of those films that crush your mind and continue to resonate even after you leave the theater.",

  "content": "It’s a bit like a wheel with lots of spokes, this mystery. It starts with a scenario in which seventeen kids all get out of bed at precisely 2.17 am, leave their well-appointed homes, only to never been seen again. The cops are baffled and the parents are suspicious. Of what? Well, they were all from the same class of “Justine” (Julia Garner) and the only other pupil to turn up next day: “Alex” (Cary Christopher). What has she done with them all? What does she know? We start with a telling of events from her point of view, then next it’s the perspective of angry parent “Archer” (Josh Brolin) to weave his part of the web; then policemen “Paul” (Alden Ehrenreich); her boss “Marcus” (Benedict Wong) and then, finally, we get the perspective of the only “surviving” pupil who has recently welcomed his eccentric aunt “Gladys” (Amy Madigan) who is apparently on death’s door, and who seems somewhat distracted as he comes to school. Is that because his classmates have all gone awol or maybe he knows more than we think? To be honest, there’s not so much mystery here, but there are some solidly entertaining performances and for the first hour or so, quite a bit of intriguing menace too. The overlaying of each story takes us from similar timelines of the puzzle but never repetitively. Each one of these people has a demon of their own, they are connected to some of the others and not to others, and the whole unravelling process becomes more of a study of small time communities, attitudes and superstitions as it sort of shakes off it’s horror cloak and becomes something altogether more rushed and predictable. Garner, Christopher and Madigan deliver quite well, but Brolin is about as charismatic as a tent pole and as he starts to feature more in the denouement he does rather encourage you to hope that he goes the way of the missing kids. It’s very much at the better end of the genre from 2025 so far, but it still can’t sustain the mysterious “Pied Piper” sense of peril through to an ending that is hardly original.",

  "content": "If a horror flick hopes to succeed, it must fulfill one basic requirement – it has to be scary. Regrettably, however, that’s where the latest offering from writer-director Zach Cregger drops the ball, a downfall brought on by a host of other shortcomings. The film chronicles the mysterious overnight disappearance of all but one student from the third grade class of newly hired teacher Justine Gandy (Julia Garner). While there’s no direct evidence implicating her in this troubling event, she quickly becomes a target for scrutiny and ridicule, particularly since none of the other elementary school’s classes reported any missing pupils. Officials are at a loss, and the only one of Ms. Gandy’s students who did not vanish, Alex Lilly (Cary Christopher), is unable to shed any light on why he was spared the same fate as his classmates. As the investigation continues, Justine’s background – most notably her penchant for alcohol abuse and her tendency to become too involved in the lives of her students – comes under closer examination by the police, the school principal (Benedict Wong) and the father of one of the disappeared children (Josh Brolin). The story is told in a nonlinear fashion with chapters based on the experiences of the film’s primary characters, with each segment gradually (one might more realistically say tediously) revealing different pieces of an enigmatic puzzle as seen from their respective perspectives. Admittedly, this is an interesting and commendable approach for telling the tale, one not typically employed in horror films. However, that narrative is also part of the problem, given that it’s slowly paced and sparsely frightful. It’s also seriously lacking a much-needed revelatory back story, leaving viewers wondering why events are unfolding as they do (and, consequently, leaving them unsure why they should care, either). As the picture plays out, it also loses focus, uncertain whether it wants to be a sinister thriller or a sidesplitting campy romp (I’ll vote for the latter option here, as that seems to be when the picture works best, especially with the arrival of Alex’s mysterious Aunt Gladys (Amy Madigan), who bears an uncanny and inexplicable resemblance to Bozo the Clown). All things considered, though, these elements don’t hang together well, and, as the film drones on and on, it’s easy to lose interest, especially since the rationale behind them is largely unclear. What’s more, several passing plot devices of a questionably stereotypical nature have been incorporated here as well, leaving one to ponder the reason for their inclusion. “Weapons,” unfortunately, is yet another example of a supposedly scary movie gone wrong, one that fails at its basic task and doesn’t deliver the goods on so many other fronts. Maybe the time has come for Hollywood to give this genre a rest for a while so that it can work out its growing list of issues before production begins on a round of more underwhelming, overhyped releases like this one.",

Of course, he has to be fairly clandestine about this as his dad will go ape if he finds out and fellow, and competitive, student “Astrid” (Nico Parker) - on whom he has a terrible crush - might decide to take her axe to both him and his new friend. There are a few slight modifications from the animation (2010) but otherwise it largely sticks to the story with a lovely hammy effort from Butler, an enjoyably mischievous one from his multi-appendage sidekick “Gobber” (Nick Frost) and two solid performances from the leads. It’s Thames who really steals the show amongst the humans, with a cheeky and personable effort which must have been quite a task as he spent much of the filming dangling in front of a green screen. As to the visuals, they are great. A combination of dragons galore, huge scale pyrotechnics and loads of imagination immerses you into a story of family and friendship without even the vaguest hint of the moralising that often peppers this genre. They say that, aerodynamically, a bee ought never to be able to fly: well I think that could be said of almost all of the critters here as they dart about menacingly and colourfully for a couple of hours of what is really good fun. It’s well worth a cinema outing as the whole thing looks and sounds great on a big screen and dare I say it, I might quite like a sequel if they can keep the standard of storytelling up to that of the imagery.",

  "content": "The How to Train Your Dragon live-action remake is a shot-for-shot remake of the original 2010 animated film. It is DreamWorks Animation's first foray into live-action and original screenwriter and director Dean DeBlois returns.\r\n\r\nThe few highlights of the live-action version of the film are that the majority of the dragons transition to live-action or are computer generated to extremely satisfying results. Monstrous Nightmare (the red dragon with the long snout that can ignite its entire body on fire) is exceptionally cool.\r\n\r\nVisually, How to Train Your Dragon is stunning. Many live-action shots are realistic copies of what was accomplished in the animated film which is a major accomplishment regardless of whether it was shot on location or required a green screen and various other visual effects. No one is taking away from the fact that the film looks incredible.\r\n\r\nGerard Butler, the one returning actor from the animated films, acts his ass off as Stoick. Butler’s performance was already solid, but him embodying the character and dressing as him brings out more emotion and more passion in his acting. DeBlois claims that Universal Studios wanted to tell the same story with this film; to embellish what made the animated film great. DeBlois says that the live-action version enhances the original, but the only significant enhancement is Butler’s performance.\r\n\r\nAll of the jokes and story points are the same, which don’t hit the same in live-action. It seems like an obvious fault to say that a live-action film just isn’t as animated or as energetic as an animated film but that is exactly the case here. Performances lack that cartoonish nature that made How to Train Your Dragon entertaining, funny, touching, and memorable. None of the humor works here as none of the other casting choices work like they’re supposed to.\r\n\r\nThe only reason this was remade was to add people of color to the cast. This would be fine if it was done for a valid reason, but nearly all of the black actors are background characters or have one or two lines. Ruffnut and Tuffnut are no longer actual twins. Ruffnut is suddenly a BBW and both twins are redheads. Julian Dennison (The Hunt for the Wildepeople, Deadpool 2) is Fishlegs and his performance is mostly fine as he captures the same energy, but it’s just too brief to make much of an impact.\r\n\r\nAstrid is now portrayed by Nico Parker while Gothi, the town elder, is played by Naomi Wirthner. Both characters are now portrayed by biracial actors. Wirthner is fine as Gothi because Gothi doesn’t have any lines. Parker portrays Astrid as a super bitch. In the original film, Astrid was trying to prove she was the strongest despite being a girl.\r\n\r\nHiccup’s unorthodox methods and seeming entitlement annoyed her and the ride on Toothless softened the character and represented the fact that Berk’s stance on dragons could be altered. Now Astrid stomps around like an entitled brat for what feels like a two-hour tantrum. Not to mention Hiccup (Mason Thames) looks 25 and Astrid (Parker) looks 12. Thames is younger than Parker in real life, but still.\r\n\r\nI revisited the first two How to Train Your Dragon films before seeing the live-action remake and watched How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World after. With a franchise, it’s usually a good idea to revisit the older films so major characters and story points can be fresh on your mind. Doing so before this film made it incredibly boring. This new version of the film is made for people who either haven’t seen the original film in a very long time or for a new generation of people who have never seen it. Revisiting the other films just made this one feel boring and long; the live-action film is both of those things but seeing the other films beforehand made it feel even more boring and long.\r\n\r\nAt least with live-action Disney films the animated films are used as a base and new material is built around that. The live-action Lilo & Stitch at least had the balls to try a new ending and Jumba was turned into the film’s major villain with no redemption arc. An exact replication feels so unnecessary on all accounts and something worked along the way because a live-action sequel is already greenlit.\r\n\r\nDean DeBlois and Universal Studios have somehow recreated an incredible film about dragons and the struggle to survive and turned it into this lifeless, carbon-copy shell of its former self. Hiccup’s initial riding of Toothless has this magical and tingle-inducing aura about it in the original film and here it just feels like retreaded terrain with no charisma. This is a film aimed to enhance the filmmakers and studio’s pockets and nothing more.",

  "content": "Sometimes movies have a way of surprising us in unexpectedly pleasant ways. And this latest installment in the “Jurassic” franchise is just such a case. Admittedly, I had more than a few reservations going into this one; I couldn’t help but think that this was a cinematic commodity that had run its course, that it was essentially out of gas to offer anything new of genuine value, and, to a certain degree, that’s true, at least where originality is concerned. However, despite the picture’s expected plunge into familiar territory, director Gareth Edwards’s latest feature offering is nevertheless highly entertaining, even if not particularly groundbreaking. Perhaps that rests with the fact that this is arguably the most Spielbergian installment in the series, in many ways reflective of the iconic production that launched the franchise in 1993. In yet another story involving self-serving agenda-driven characters placing themselves in tremendous peril by venturing into a world of dangerous, genetically manipulated dinosaurs recklessly brought back to life for profit and entertainment purposes, the film follows a narrative formula that most viewers will find more than a little recognizable. But what helps to set this installment apart from many of its predecessors is the quality of the filmmaking itself, specifically its ability to effectively build and maintain tension, its capacity for presenting story arc elements in fresh and inventive ways, and its overall production values, most notably its fine (and occasionally unanticipated) special effects and its efforts in upping the talent quotient of the cast with such commendable additions as Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali. Most importantly, though, this offering is to be applauded for its continuity in staying on track in terms of tone, self-aware of what kind of a movie it truly wants to be. This differentiates “Rebirth” from many of its previous releases, which often couldn’t decide whether they wanted to tell bona fide sci-fi-based tales or present themselves as campy romps (as seen, for example, in the now-famous (or is it infamous?) Bryce Dallas Howard high heel sequences in the first “Jurassic World” offering (2015)). What’s more, Spielberg’s influence in bringing this production to life is clearly present in the finished product, both in terms of honoring the merits of the series’ premiere installment, as well as in its respectful homages to the auteur’s classic 1975 offering, “Jaws.” To be sure, there are some aspects here that are wholly predictable (such as little doubt as to which characters will be offed and when), and there are times when the pacing could stand to be brisker, particularly when the film strives (sometimes a little too hard) to invoke a greater degree of character depth and development than what has typically been the case in previous “Jurassic” releases. In addition, the picture suffers from occasional plot holes, several contrived narrative devices (including one egregiously silly element near the film’s outset that nearly cost me my hopes for the remainder of the release) and more than a little blatantly shameless product placement shots. On balance, though, this is a surprisingly good picture in a series that’s now seven installments deep, an accomplishment that few franchises (other than the “Star Trek” and “007” series) can boast. Don’t be too quick to sell this one short; it may not be perfect, but it’s certainly enjoyable summertime action-adventure fare that makes for a good time on a lazy Saturday afternoon when you don’t feel like going outside to brave the heat.",

  "content": "Well at least there is one scene where huge great dinosaurs walk, accompanied by John Williams’s original theme, to remember - but otherwise this is a really disappointing video-game of a film that offers us nothing at all that the Jurassic franchise hasn’t already. By now, these great creatures have largely been taken care of by Mother Nature and have been reduced to living in small groups in equatorial zones around the world where they just want to be left alone to eat and be eaten, protected from a humanity which is “expressly” prohibited from going there. The grasping “Krebs” (Rupert Friend - Orlando Bloom must have been busy) has a plan to cure heart disease and so recruits special ops veteran “Zora” (Scarlett Johansson) to help him secure the living DNA from three of the greatest of these creatures. They wouldn’t know one if they saw one though, so have to convince the nerdy scientist “Loomis” (Jonathan Bailey) to accompany them and their local fixer “Kincaid” (Mahershala Ali) and they head deep into these deadly waters. Meantime, a family are blithely sailing from Bermuda to Cape Town, apparently unaware of the dangers posed by these Vernian monsters. They are dad, young daughter, hormonal older daughter and her bone idle boyfriend, “Xavier” (David Iacono). Boy are they in for a shock when they cross some huge great, and angry, Mosasaurus and end up with most of their boat pointing the wrong way in the water, but with “Xavier” still able to catch some rays whilst they await rescue from, well you can guess who comes, and largely what happens from here on in. For much of the movie, we have two parallel storylines to underwhelm us: the unarmed yet remarkably resilient family have to find an abandoned HQ whilst the mercenaries play a sort of level-by-level game navigating the usual island full of beasties adventures that haven’t really advanced much since it’s nearest biological cousin - “Jurassic Park III” (2001). Oddly enough, I didn’t think these visual effects were anywhere near as effective as in the originals. Maybe we are all just too used to these great animals lumbering about on land, breaching like whales at sea, or swooping and pecking relentlessly from the air? Johansson does join in enthusiastically and Jonathan Bailey really has one one of those smiles on his face that suggests he is enjoying his days in front of the green screen knowing it has to be easier than singing “Not Getting Married” on stage eight times a week - and probably better paid. The others really only make up the numbers, though, with a few characters obviously designated as dino-fodder early-on as it rehashes scenarios from just about everything from “Indian Jones” to “Harry Potter”. It might be like comparing apples and pears, but I have to say I found the current “How to Train Your Dragon” a much more enjoyable adventure about man’s relationship with thick-skinned, scaly, predators, because this entirely forgettable film will do little more than slot nicely into the Christmas television schedules with little, if anything, to distinguish about it once it’s grand scale cinema run has concluded. PS: I don’t know about inventing a miracle-cure drug, but whoever designed JB’s glasses ought to patent a design that stays firmly affixed to his face the entire time without moving, cracking, breaking or even slipping down his nose!",

  "content": "17 years ago, a group of scientists got the bright idea to mutate dinosaurs. One of those mutations was a Distortus Rex, a Tyrannosaur mutation, also known as the D-Rex. Thanks to a Snickers wrapper, the D-Rex escapes, causing the facility to be shut down.\r\n\r\nIn the present day, five years after the events of Jurassic World: Dominion, dinosaurs are dying out and can no longer survive Earth’s environment. However, closer to the equator, the tropical atmosphere allows them to flourish. ParkerGenix, a pharmaceutical company, wants to manufacture a drug capable of preventing coronary heart disease. But they need to extract blood samples from three of the largest living dinosaurs: Mosasaurus (water), Titanosaurus (land), and Quetzalcoatlus (sky).\r\n\r\nSo a group of covert operatives decides to travel illegally to Ile Saint-Hubert to retrieve the samples, where they’ll most likely face certain death and where the D-Rex now roams free.\r\n\r\nJurassic World Rebirth is a lot like smashing the first three Jurassic Park films together with disappointing results. Written by David Koepp (Jurassic Park, The Lost World) and directed by Gareth Evans (Godzilla, Rogue One), Rebirth feels like it recycles all of the major action sequences from the Jurassic Park films with no character development whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThe motive for every character in Rebirth is money. The film gives these moments where it seems like it’s going to reveal some sort of back story or give some sort of reason for you to care about these emotionless doofuses, but the film quickly backtracks or gives a half-ass response before tumbling into non-seriousness.\r\n\r\nZora (Scarlett Johansson) just finished a mission where she lost someone she was close to. Duncan (Mahershala Ali) had a son who died, which caused his marriage to end. The people with Zora and Duncan are just in it for the money, like them. A family is sailing in the Atlantic Ocean as some last hurrah before the college-age daughter goes off to NYU and has the nerve to act like victims when the Mosasaurus wrecks their boat.\r\n\r\nReuben (Manuel Garcia Rulfo) is a dad that decided to take his two daughters and her daughter’s boyfriend (who is a lethargic turd, by the way) out in a boat in the middle of nowhere because “they’d done it before.” His youngest just wants to eat licorice, the NYU-bound daughter makes terrible decisions, and her boyfriend Xavier (David Iacono) is lazy and unlikeable, and you just want to slap this entire family for two hours straight.\r\n\r\nThe film opens with the D-Rex escape and then flounders about in trite, boring dialogue for 45 minutes until the Mosasaurus shows up. The problem is that you end up despising all of the human characters. Zora doesn’t take anything seriously, Duncan laughs at everything, Henry Loomis (Jonathan Bailey) is a nerdy paleontologist who has no actual qualities about himself apart from his dinosaur knowledge, and everyone else either whines about everything and survives the entire film and whines forever, or is a loud but eventual dinosaur appetizer.\r\n\r\nRebirth does give more screen time to lesser-known dinosaurs, as velociraptors and T-Rexes are reduced to mere cameos. Most of the screen time is split between the Mosasaurus and Quetzalcoatlus, which allows Rebirth to spend more time in the water than previous Jurassic Park and Jurassic World films. Many people get eaten throughout Jurassic World Rebirth, which is satisfying given how painful it is to endure their presence. It’s also interesting that the dinosaurs get more birdlike throughout the franchise. The Quetzalcoatlus sequences are cool because of the claustrophobic nature of its nest and the sheer design of it, which resembles a bird with its feather-like appearance and beak-like nose.\r\n\r\nThe character development in Rebirth is nonexistent, but so is an actual ending. All these people die, and the survivors settle on doing this one specific thing, and then the credits roll as they’re riding in the boat away from the deadly dinosaur island. There’s all this dialogue about how they shouldn’t go there, how they know it’s stupid, and how it’s highly deadly and illegal. But then everyone acts surprised and angry when people start dying and things go wrong. The entire film is almost as dumb as the D-Rex design.\r\n\r\nJurassic World Rebirth is the worst film of the Jurassic Park/World franchise because it has nothing original to offer. It spends so much time paying homage to the films that came before it that it lacks its own identity. These are some of the most annoying and entitled cinematic characters of the year and you root for them to end up in an archaic intestinal tract and grunted out into antiquated dino shit.",

  "content": "“Jurassic World Rebirth” swings the franchise back to where it all started, both literally and thematically. Leaning hard into nostalgia, director Gareth Edwards peppers his film with sequences that mirror the most memorable moments from the original “Jurassic Park” so closely you can practically hear the 1993 film reel whirring in the background. But instead of feeling like a cheap rehash, these callbacks often land as thrilling homages that give longtime fans the satisfying jolt of seeing familiar sights updated with today’s high-tech CGI. If you love dinosaurs and all things in the series, this is a more than decent seventh installment.\r\n\r\nThe story picks up five years after the story line in “Jurassic World: Dominion.” Dinosaurs now barely cling to survival and live solely in isolated tropical zones that mimic their prehistoric habitats. At the behest of greedy drug company representative Martin Krebs (Rupert Friend), an expedition is launched to collect DNA from the last three colossal creatures with the intent to manufacture a revolutionary medical breakthrough (and of course, make the company mega rich). Martin assembles a team of mercenaries (Scarlett Johansson, Mahershala Ali) and a dino scientist (Jonathan Bailey) to help, but things take a turn when they rescue a family (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Luna Blaise, Audrina Miranda) stranded at sea.  \r\n\r\nWhile the story and tone may be a slightly different shift from the other films, this one still checks many of the usual blockbuster boxes (and sometimes it does so lazily). I caught myself thinking, “Haven’t I seen this before?” several times, but I stayed engaged with the story. Edwards brings a confident hand to the chaos, balancing massive action set pieces with quieter, tense moments that recall Spielberg’s original. Themes of empathy, redemption, and the perils of unchecked scientific ambition are explored, along with some not-so-subtle commentary on human greed and unlikely heroism. The characters are thoughtfully written too, with several showing personal growth during their adventure. By casting accomplished actors, the performances are strong and elevate the material significantly.\r\n\r\nThe visual effects are by far the best thing about the film, and they are nothing short of jaw-dropping. The dinosaurs look incredibly lifelike, and it’s thrilling to watch them roar and stomp throughout the tropical island. CGI technology has come a long way, and this is one of the best looking films in the entire series.\r\n\r\n“Jurassic World Rebirth” knows what it is: a big summer spectacle. On that front, it absolutely delivers. This entertaining thrill ride is pure popcorn entertainment with just enough heart to make you care. \r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

It is really hard for me to watch a longer video without doing something else too but I watched the entire length of this movie without thinking anything about doing something else or eat or touching my phone. Some more thoughts if you already watched the movie and just want to read things others say but you really should not care about: could it have been better? yes, i missed more info about certain events or characters. not much more, but just a little bit more. the ending? perfect. I expected something else then it still delivered. I don't really know how to say this but you can feel proud watching this, the entire way through the movie. There is nothing to really cringe about and I really appreciate this. This alone makes this movie in the top for me. A lot of new and relatively new movies (especially drama, fantasy, super hero things) are cringefest and in parts uncomfortable to watch. This is not. I am happy.",

  "content": "With Sir Lewis Hamilton and F1 media veteran Ian Holmes amongst those at the helm of this production, you can be certain that it’s going to be as an authentic story of all things F1 (can’t be bothered finding the trademark symbol) as you’re ever likely to see. It’s all about team “Ruben” (Javier Bardem) whose cars couldn’t beat an egg and so is looking at ending up broke! His remaining driver is British rookie “Joshua” (Damson Idris) but he’s nowhere near experienced enough to make any impact on the problem. For that, he needs to coax back “Sonny” (Brad Pitt) who did drive these cars twenty years ago but hung up his helmet after an accident and then became an itinerant driver eking a living across the USA. Can he be tempted? Well we’d have no film if he wasn’t so the next question is: can he manage to salvage this operation before it’s sold for scrap? True to form with this sport, what now ensues sees all the glitz and glamour of circuits around the world; money no object cars, training and equipment; testosterone galore both in the car and with team tech director “Kate” (Kerry Condon) as well as a whole slew of rule manipulating, crashes, downright cheating and I have to say, some of the best action and in-car photography I’ve seen on a big screen. Indeed, I could cheerfully have lived without the dramatic characterisation here altogether, and just stuck to the tensely directed and really compelling action sequences that, especially using the in-car cameras, is genuinely quite exciting to watch. You really do get a sense of the speed of the cars racing round the tracks and of the phenomenal engineering that goes into the design and manufacture of these cars that at times look no more substantial than an Airfix kit. Pitt is in his element here delivering a character that’s a lovable rogue meets smug git whilst Idris comes across entirely naturally as the youngster out of his depth but willing and determined to learn. The soundtrack from the likes of Queen and Led Zeppelin livens up what I’d have to say isn’t Hans Zimmer’s most memorable score, and with the last half hour largely devoid of the romantic and emotional clutter, we watch something that shows us this circus in full pomp. You don’t need to be remotely interested in this topic to enjoy this film, you only really need a pulse and a great big screen.",

Their only route to salvation would appear to be to give up their new shiny haloes and start working with the dastardly “Kitty Kat” who has a cunning plan to turn a spaceship into a giant magnet that can collect all the gold from the face of the planet. Even the burgeoning romance that might (or might not) be going on between “Fox” and mayor “Diane” is unlikely to stop the police commissioner from getting them behind bars once again. They’ve got their work cut out for them, and as everyone knows - there’s no one scorned like a cat in heels!  It reminded me a bit of one of the early “Mission Impossible” films, with the emphasis on the gadgets and the scenarios, but not really on the characterisations. Aside from a little wolf/fox mischief the whole thing just followed an all too predicable pattern of out of the pan into the fire escapades that can only ever really lead to “Bad Guys 3”. The animation is great and there is plenty of action, but I wasn’t overwhelmed by the originality of any of this and I couldn’t help but wish that they were just plain, out-and-out, bad again. All this goody-goody stuff changes the dynamic between the critters, and not in an enjoyable way. My own favourite, “Tarantula” doesn’t feature nearly enough and there’s also an awful lot of dialogue. I might just be desensitised to these animated crime capers now, but this just didn’t do anything for me. Sorry.",

  "content": "The Bad Guys 2 begins with a heist in Cairo, Egypt, five years prior, where we see how Mr. Wolf (Sam Rockwell) acquired his trademark black car. In the present day and after the events of the first film, Mr. Wolf, Mr. Shark (Craig Robinson), Mr. Piranha (Anthony Ramos), and Ms. Tarantula/Webs (Awkwafina) all struggle to find jobs. They’ve all gone good and no longer pull off heists, but have recently been rumored to have gone bad again because a new thief known as the Phantom Bandit is framing them at every scene of the crime. Meanwhile, Mr. Snake (Marc Maron) is suspiciously happy, relaxed, and barely around.\r\n\r\nMr. Wolf and his friends are roped into one final job by a snow leopard named Kitty Kat (Danielle Brooks) and her team, consisting of a Bulgarian wild boar engineer named Pigtail (Maria Bakalova) and a sarcastically deceitful raven named Doom (Natasha Lyonne). This new group of female criminals has dirt on current mayor Diane Foxington (Zazie Beetz), and Wolf will do everything he can to keep her safe, even if it means going back to prison.\r\n\r\nThe Bad Guys had killer animation and an incredible voice cast, but the issue was that the film was massively predictable, even if you didn’t read the books. The chemistry amongst the cast drove the film, but the humor was so-so. The animation was an incredible blend of 2D and 3D animation, and while the film’s style had similarities with Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, visually, no other animated film looked like it.\r\n\r\nAs a sequel, The Bad Guys 2 expands on just about everything the original film did. While the animation is the same style, it explores vast new territories, whereas even something as simple as a car chase feels more impressive. The Cairo opening of the film (which is also Webs’s first job) features a car chase between The Bad Guys and what appears to be the entire Cairo police force. The chase includes driving on walls, releasing a bunch of caged chickens, driving in reverse in a roundabout, and the entire police force having to all ride on one motorcycle because all of their other vehicles were destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe animated heist comedy sequel also has big moments in a lucha libre wrestling ring and even travels to space for a massive finale. The lucha libre material allows for so much fluorescent and dramatic lighting, which results in some really eye-catching visuals between hydraulic bouncing low-riders and dynamic character introductions. Going to space allows typical physics to not be an element anymore, which sees anti-gravity enter the picture. Mr. Piranha’s nervous flatulence is taken to Rocketman (the 1997 Harland Williams movie) extremes, and it’s great.  \r\n\r\nThe sequence where Mr. Wolf and his buddies jump onto the MoonX rocket that has already launched is crazy and feels like something ripped straight out of one of the Mission: Impossible films. It moves at an accelerated pace, the gang has to think fast and use all of their animal attributes to stay on the rocket as its many sections keep falling into the atmosphere, and the sequence amplifies what is already a thrilling and inventive use of camera perspectives. \r\n\r\nThe humor in the film feels way more adult this time around, too, especially when it comes to Mr. Snake’s new romance with his girlfriend, Susan. When they kiss, Snake tries to swallow her entire head, which is already disturbing. But there’s a lock-picking sequence where Mr. Snake is describing what he’s doing, and it’s blatant innuendo.\r\n\r\nMr. Wolf drives a hatchback car (like a Toyota Tercel) in the present day that smokes, sputters, and is on its last legs. The gang is broke now, with a constant barrage of eviction and past due notices arriving daily. As Mr. Wolf is parking before a job interview, someone drives past him and calls him a jackass. This is a completely fair term when donkeys are probably a part of this anthropomorphic world somewhere, but it's not the friendliest term for a family film.\r\n\r\nA frustrating aspect of the film is that The Bad Guys have to prove themselves yet again. They went good and had this big production of Professor Marmalade’s (Richard Ayoade) downfall. So the fact that they have to do it all over again is a bit redundant. The sequel does a solid job of portraying why Mr. Wolf and his friends could be The Bad Guys again to the public eye, but it’s lame how quickly everyone turns on them.\r\n\r\nThe Bad Guys 2 is bigger, badder, and funnier than its predecessor. The gags are wilder and more creative, the jokes land and make you laugh, and the new characters are just as intriguing as the familiar ones. Unique locations in the film allow the animation to construct some of the most visually impressive and charismatically animated sequences of the year, as well. Being a good guy has never felt so rewarding and entertaining.",

  "content": "The gang of animated outlaws returns for “The Bad Guys 2,” a sequel that ups the ante with its sharper, more character-driven story. This time around, the film leans more toward a stylized crime caper than a mindless kiddie cartoon, resulting in a grittier, slightly darker tone than expected.\r\n\r\nAfter spending years being very, very bad, criminals Wolf (voice of Sam Rockwell), Snake (voice of Marc Maron), Tarantula (voice of Awkwafina), Shark (voice of Craig Robinson), and Piranha (voice of Anthony Ramos) are trying to go straight. The group of friends soon learn that it’s not so easy to navigate a world that’s not keen on giving second chances. Despite their best efforts, their new “Good Guy” lives are quickly upended when they’re dragged back into the world of high-stakes heists by a slick all-female crew known as The Bad Girls. What unfolds is a globe-trotting mission full of twists, trust issues, and one very elaborate criminal scheme.\r\n\r\nThematically, the film has more on its mind than most animated fare. It explores whether true change is possible and honestly depicts the struggle to shed the labels of your past. There’s a surprising amount of emotional weight beneath all the action and antics, particularly in how the characters grapple with acceptance, identity, and redemption in a society that already has its mind made up about them.\r\n\r\nThe film visually delivers with stylish animation and action scenes that are fluid, fast, and impressively staged. The diverse voice cast is excellent across the board, breathing energy and nuance into the characters without slipping into caricature. These aren’t generic animated archetypes, but characters that are flawed, funny, and fully realized.\r\n\r\nOf course, the movie does require a healthy suspension of disbelief. This is a world where talking animals and humans coexist without much explanation, and while the film doesn’t bother justifying it, most viewers probably won’t mind. Still, some of the more absurd plot elements (including the villain’s big evil plan and a trip into space on the back of a rocket) will stretch the patience of some kids and most adults.\r\n\r\nWhile it’s marketed as a family film, this one definitely skews older. Younger children might find it too long, too talky, or just too dark. There’s a more mature tone here than the first film, making it more of a heist thriller than a forgettable Saturday morning cartoon.\r\n\r\nWith a satisfying ending that sets up potential future installments, “The Bad Guys 2” is a sequel that dares to deepen its characters and themes rather than just replaying the laziest hits (okay, there are a few lowbrow fart jokes, but at least they’re funny and aren’t out of context). The film is stylish, smart, occasionally silly, and a welcome shift away from typical animated fluff. It may not be for all ages, but for fans of animated films that aim a little higher, this is one bad crew worth rooting for.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

How can a spider be so cute?! \r\n\r\nThe antagonist seen in the trailer are all lovely new additions with their own, very distinct personalities. Also, Kitty is basically Tai Lung, so, that's cool.\r\n\r\nOn a tech side, which I can only barely judge really:\r\nEverything looks really nice with clean, quick animations and damn did I love the gold particle effects in one scene especially!\r\nThe facial expression, like in the first movie, are really lovely as well.\r\n\r\nSo, yeah, definitely recommended! By far not as emotional heavy as movies like Coco and Toy Story 3, but hey, it's good for a chance ro just enjoy some happiness instead of wanting to cry in a comedy movie! \r\n\r\nGo watch it! \r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n(To add to some of the other reviews on other sites: yes, so many hot characters!

  "content": "I must admit, I’d completely forgotten “Nobody” (2021) when I sat down to watch this, but once it picks up an head of steam it’s actually quite a good fun, entirely senseless, stream of violence that does raise a smile. Still beholden to “The Barber” (Colin Salmon) after his first outing, “Hutch” (Bob Odenkirk) has been carrying out some dangerous tasks to try and reduce his $30 millions debt. After this most recent task, though, he declares that he is going to take an holiday with his wife (Connie Nielsen), his kids and his dad (Christopher Lloyd). They decide to return to one of his childhood haunts but aren’t there very long before “Hutch” sees red and is smashing up the people, the furniture, the fruit machines - even a duck-boat, and that earns his the attention of the menacingly ruthless “Lendina” (Sharon Stone) whose drug-smuggling enterprise is being interfered with, and she’s none too happy about that. When the pyrotechnics manage to destroy a fairly massive shipment of her cash and her “product” she is just going to have to come and settle the score herself - and that’s the denouement this builds to, quite entertainingly, for an hour and an half. The only thing it is missing is an alligator as noses and bones get broken left, right and centre; there is loads of betrayal and some new friendships made before the wonderfully hammy Stone and the underused Lloyd make their presence felt: the former more in the style of something from “John Wick”, the latter more from “The A-Team”. If their is a moral, well it’s probably never to give your arcade tickets to the girlfriend of the son of the local kingpin, otherwise maybe they’d just have eaten candy floss and gone home more rested.",

Cabbage that stank and coffee that wasn't real coffee. \r\n\r\nI have to say I've come to feel the same way about a lot of Western entertainment in recent years. It lacks vibrancy, individuality, it lacks flavour. \r\n\r\nThe latest and I have to say  unwanted iteration of \"Nobody\", the unimaginatively  titled \"Nobody 2\" meets that definition. What made the first film work is precisely why the second film fails. It was a little original the first time around, with a reveal, that is, the suburban father being a talented assassin, no one had expected. With that out of the way whats left is anti climatic, repetitive  exposition, that's as uninspiring as its tired, 1970's theme park, setting. \r\n\r\nI know people starved for any kind of action film will like it. I get that. Speaking for myself personally, I'd like a little more. A dash of creativity, a spark of inspiration, not just more of the same beige entertainment, off the lazy Hollywood production line. \r\n\r\nIn summary, \"Nobody 2\" is alright. Its a basic action flick that fills the entertainment gap but still leaves you craving something more substantial. A mediocre watch.",

  "content": "Though Cillian Murphy takes top billing and turns in a visceral effort in the title role, this is really a formidable ensemble effort as he leads a small group to teachers in what seems to be a constant rearguard action with some of the most unruly teenagers you’ll ever see. Helped out by his deputy “Amanda” (Tracey Ullman) and self-medicating regularly, he has the added pressure of a local BBC television crew coming to do a piece on the place; the local MP is also coming to get in on that action and the local council are also along this day to tell them all that the school’s future - at around £30k p.a. per pupil, is making the whole enterprise increasingly unfeasible. Our first glimpse of the residents sees us meet “Shy” (Jay Lycurgo) who is dancing about in a field slowly getting ”baked” at 10am! Then there’s “Jamie” (Luke Ayres). Larger than life in every sense and sharp enough to wind up just about everyone else; “Riley” (Joshua J. Parker) is akin to the Duracell Bunny only at ten times the speed. “Shola” (Little Simz) is the newbie teacher and Emily Watson’s “Jenny” tries to fathom out the psychology of their erratic behaviour. They are all foul-mouthed, violent and obnoxious, sure - but they are all also bright; they fight and brawl but there is loyalty amongst them, affection even. Each character gets their moment under the spotlight, but essentially we focus on “Steve” - a man who has demons of his own and on “Shy” whose behaviour has left his mum and stepfather to cut all ties with the lad. You get the sense that both men are in a very similar boat, only one of them wears a tie and the other some orange-foam headphones - and both deliver emotionally-charged performances. Ullman is strong and sympathetic in support to just about everyone and there is a unifying cameo from Roger Allam who plays the typically pompous and condescending MP “Montague-Powell” (pronounced “Pole”) who, like all but those who actually lived in this rapidly dilapidating stately pile, had little idea of just what went on here, and of just how crucial this infrastructure was in offering a semblance of hope, security and consistency to young men who’s lucidity ebbed and flowed as readily as the tides we see so often on the poster on the wall. The last few minutes remind us, powerfully, that these staff are professional people who must try to balance the demands of their careers with those of their personal lives, and the clever use of a tape recorder to serve as an aide-memoir to “Steve” has a double benefit of also helping the audience to appreciate just how stressful all of their lives were. No matter just how futile their efforts frequently appeared to be, these were not people inclined to give up - regardless of the sacrifices they would routinely and repeatedly have to make. The kids? Well the acting on display here is natural, entertaining, chilling and acrobatic all whilst offering us a sense of their vulnerability, their loneliness and their inter-dependence - for all their bravado and practical jokes. It’s a breakneck piece of cinema that serves to make us realise that there can be no price put on their vocational skills nor on the provision of “care” for these people whom society at large would doubtless consider a threat and who would almost certainly incarcerate them. It’s a very tricky subject to get across with integrity, but I think this does make you sit up and think - and laugh occasionally, too.",

  "content": "Hmmm! I wasn’t sure if I was watching a sentimental edition of “Hawaii Five-O” here or a collection of outtakes from a “Sonic” movie as this rather disappointingly trundles along for the guts of two hours. It’s starts off quite promisingly as we see the “Grand Councilwoman” sentence the latest creation of madcap scientist “Jumba” to exile under the supervision of himself and Earth expert “Pleakley”. It turns out that the eponymous blue critter is actually quite a malevolent beastie adept at causing no end of mischief, and with the authorities now on his tail, he concludes that the safest thing to do is to hide in plain sight and get him self adopted by the none-too-bright “Lilo” (Maia Kealoha) who actually thinks he’s a dog! What is even dafter is that her elder sister “Nani” (Sydney Agudong) also reckons there is nothing so abnormal about a lively blue pet that can enunciate - though that’s perhaps because she is dazzled by the affections of the beefcake poster boy next door “David” (the hilariously wooden Kaipo Dudoit). Anyway, that’s the scene set as the predicable character arcs take us on a journey from bereavement and rebelliousness to the certainty of it’s long-in-coming denouement. It has it’s Laurel and Hardy moments, and at times there is some very light comedy - usually from Billy Magnussen, but I’m afraid that the story hasn’t the courage of it’s initially mischievous convictions and I rather lost interest as a sea of sentiment washed over me. Maybe it needs a “Brightburn” style director’s cut to spice it up a bit, but as it is it is an ok watch for the kids but not much more.",

  "content": "While watching Disney’s new live-action version of Lilo & Stitch, the film felt fairly accurate to the original 2002 animated film for the first half of the film while the second half seemed insanely different in comparison. However, upon revisiting the original film, the live-action version features many unwanted modifications.\r\n\r\nPleakley and Jumba are butchered in the new film. Now played by Billy Magnussen and Zach Galifianakis respectively both spend the majority of the film as humans (they use alien technology to mimic humans early in the film). This was likely done as a cost-cutting measure, especially after the opening of the film is all CGI, but it’s awkward. Lilo & Stitch was originally meant as a Disney+ exclusive and has the lowest budget ($100 million) of any Disney live-action remake since Cruella.\r\n\r\nMagnussen at least has the same personality and a similar voice to Kevin McDonald’s in the original film. The new film turns Jumba into the main villain and strips the character of his Russian accent. In the original film, Jumba is hunting Stitch up until the point where Stitch simply asks Jumba to help him which he abides by.\r\n\r\nAs humans, both Magnussen and Galifianakis seem to be wearing false teeth or something as they both have overbites that completely alter their speech. It gives the characters this uncanny valley appearance that is way more unsettling than it should be.\r\n\r\nCobra Bubbles is no longer a former CIA agent turned CPS social worker. He’s now just a CIA agent with no personality whatsoever. Courtney B. Vance portrays Bubbles in the film and while his acting skills are fine his frame isn’t big enough. Oddly, Disney is currently hiring actors who never saw the original film for their remakes though. Galifianakis didn’t even know who Jumba was while Courtney B. Vance didn’t watch the film because Stitch scared his kids. It’s no wonder their performances aren’t satisfying.\r\n\r\nThe new film splits the Bubbles character into two characters. Bubbles is a straightforward CIA agent while Tia Carrere (the original voice of Nani) portrays the CPS social worker and is essentially all of the softer and kinder aspects that made Bubbles interesting. She manifests what made Bubbles interesting, but is otherwise a bit flat while trying to be a worthwhile character on her own.\r\n\r\nLilo and Nani now have neighbors who are also part of their Ohana. The film strips David of whatever charm he may have had in the animated film. Kaipo Dudoi portrays him as a bumbling idiot who can’t talk or put a sentence together to save his life. His grandma Tutu (Amy Hill) is almost never in the film without riding her 4-wheeler. She takes Lilo to the pound to pick up Stitch behind Nani’s back whereas it was Nani’s idea in the animated film.\r\n\r\nSome big alterations come in the form of both Lilo and Stitch. Lilo lashed out in the animated film but had a vivid imagination. In the new film, Maia Kealoha has the right voice and mannerisms, but the way she is written injects all of the obnoxious behavior of her character and none of what makes her interesting.\r\n\r\nIn the 2002 film, Stitch doesn’t say more than three or four words at a time until the ending where he asks to say goodbye and talks about his little and broken family still being good. Most of his dialogue is his alien language and various catchphrases. He begins talking in full sentences halfway into the live-action film. There are also no cute and fluffy jokes, which is a crime in itself.\r\n\r\nThe new film erases Stitch’s infatuation with The Ugly Duckling, which feels like a huge story shift. Stitch learns what family is and learns that he doesn’t have parents because he was made in a lab and not born naturally. He relates to The Ugly Duckling because he wants to be a part of a family. A family he never had can’t come pick him up or make him feel better, so he finds his own.\r\n\r\nThere’s also this new concept of Stitch getting heavier the longer he’s in the water. This new story element will obviously factor into how things unfold later in the film, but Stitch didn’t like water originally and couldn’t swim. For possessing “enhanced intellect,” deciding to go into the water when you can’t swim and because you’ll likely never reach the surface again if you fall in seems dumb.\r\n\r\nThe other differences are mostly little ones that are still bothersome. There’s less of an emphasis on Elvis and his music, Stitch loses his red alien clothes after he’s run over in the animated film whereas he just kind of lands naked in the live-action one, he adores cake in the live-action film whereas he takes one bite and then spits it back up whole in the animated, there’s no coin-operated spaceship sequence or Stitch getting into the laundry and wearing a bra on his head and a towel like a cape to look like a superhero, and he hijacks a Power Wheels in the new film instead of a Big Wheel.\r\n\r\nThe film looks fairly good, as all of the animated characters transitioned to live-action rather seamlessly. All of the Stitch sequences are great. Stitch's interactions with Lilo are still fun. The sequences with Jumba’s portal gun are some of the best in the live-action film. As a huge fan of the original film, this remake suffers from feeling unnecessary, especially since Stitch is still one of the most popular Disney characters.\r\n\r\nLilo & Stitch is a watchable live-action Disney remake with some entertaining moments, but its knack for revising half of what made the animated version memorable and molding it into something more mediocre is baffling.",

  "content": "This is quite an entertaining stand alone fantasy adventure that doesn’t really require you to know anything about what’s gone on before. Thanks to the sacred lotus, there’s a bit of reincarnation going on, but will that be completed in time to save the population of the “Chentang Pass” about to be attacked by an army of lava-borne devils? With certain defeat looming, the immortals start to take an hand in things - not unlike the story of the siege of Troy, and just like that take from antiquity, there is plenty of betrayal and duplicity to complement the more traditional stories of loyalty, family and team building as the story gradually builds to it’s pot-boiling climax. The CGI is better than many, much less two-dimensional, and there is lots of vibrant action as the naive but honourable young “Nezha” must find his own destiny, define his relationship with the more clean cut “Ao Bing” all despite the distant intervention of the “Loong” dragon kings and always under the watchful gaze of the cloud-hopping “Wu Liang” - a being outwardly benign and munificent, but is he all that he seems behind that grey beard? If you are of a mind to look deeper, then it may well offer up a critique of modern China - or, quite possibly many other societies, where the weak are manipulated and persecuted, where family is increasingly undervalued and where power and riches are the true gods. Essentially, I just found it to be a classily produced computer animation that mixed the astonishing richness of Chinese mythology with a solid adventure concept and just a little bit of pantomime humour as we go along. It looks great in a cinema, and doesn’t hang about getting off to a lively start  and pacing well for a couple of action-packed hours.",

  "content": "**“Ne Zha 2” – A Spectacle with Hidden Flaws**\r\n\r\nNe Zha 2 is undeniably one of the most talked-about Chinese animated films this year. It shines in visual spectacle and box office performance, yet its storytelling, character development, and marketing approach have raised considerable controversy.\r\n\r\n**Strengths: A Blend of Technical Brilliance and Emotional Pull**\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the film’s visuals are stunning. From the vast underwater world to intense battle sequences, the technical craftsmanship sets a new benchmark for Chinese animation. The art direction, with its distinct Eastern fantasy flavor, delivers imagery that rivals Hollywood productions.\r\n\r\nOn an emotional level, the bond between Ne Zha and Ao Bing still resonates. Themes of friendship and family, though somewhat conventional, are presented with enough intensity to move audiences. For fans of the first film, this familiar emotional thread is a key factor in sustaining box office momentum.\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses: Shallow Story, Stagnant Characters**\r\n\r\nBut when we shift our focus from spectacle to story, the shortcomings become apparent.\r\n\r\nContrived storytelling: Many conflicts feel forced, driven by the need to move the plot rather than by genuine character motivation. Supporting roles such as Shen Gongbao or Lady Stone are reduced to narrative props.\r\n\r\nRepetitive character arcs: Ne Zha’s rebellious transformation was already central in the first film, yet this sequel repeats the same beats without offering meaningful growth.\r\n\r\nUneven pacing: The film relies heavily on set pieces while skimming over emotional build-up. Comedy and tragedy often feel abrupt, creating the impression that technical “show-off” takes precedence over genuine storytelling.\r\n\r\nAs a result, despite its dazzling surface, the film often feels hollow, lacking the lasting depth that keeps stories alive in memory.\r\n\r\n**Marketing and Box Office Tactics: Overexertion**\r\n\r\nAfter release, the film’s run was extended four times, stretching from the Lunar New Year season all the way into summer. While promoted as a response to “audience demand,” it was largely a deliberate strategy to inflate box office numbers. This prolonged dominance squeezed out newer films and led to audience fatigue.\r\n\r\nEven more curious was the phenomenon of fans buying multiple tickets to give away to friends or colleagues—essentially acting as street promoters for the studio. While this boosted revenue figures, it also undermines the authenticity of box office as a measure of genuine audience interest. Numbers driven by hype are not the same as numbers driven by real demand.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion: Industrial Triumph, Narrative Regret**\r\n\r\nNe Zha 2 stands as an impressive industrial achievement, showcasing China’s growth in animation technology, marketing, and commercial execution. Yet its reliance on spectacle and aggressive box office tactics highlights a core issue: without strong storytelling and deeper character work, such success risks feeling hollow.\r\n\r\nThe film is both a milestone and a mirror—it reflects the heights Chinese animation can reach, while reminding us that lasting impact still depends not on hype or spectacle, but on the strength of the story itself.",

Like It honestly seems like the producers didn’t even try, since some scenes look copied and pasted from the original and the movie in general don't make sense in many parts nor what the actual \r\nSubject for the movie was, I feel so disappointed in this since I was so excited to see the movie to end up feeling dissatisfied and definitely disappointed😕",

  "content": "Despite the ever-growing popularity of horror films, I can honestly say I’ve really tired of half-baked releases that just don’t cut it, and that’s very much the case with this debut feature from writer-director Michael Shanks. By “half-baked,” I’m referring to pictures that aren’t especially scary, fall into patterns of predictable plot developments, routinely incorporate vague, unexplained elements, and fail woefully in their attempts at trying to offer audiences “something more” in terms of meaningful content, themes or insights. Regrettably, this combination of underwhelming qualities often results in meandering narratives that make little sense and don’t deliver on their hoped-for entertainment and visionary promises. It’s particularly disappointing with offerings that aspire to the commendable “smart horror” moniker yet still manage to come up short, as is so here. For what it’s worth, “Together” follows the cryptic, unsettling experiences of Tim (Dave Franco) and Millie (Alison Brie), a tale in which these real-life off-screen spouses portray a long-term unmarried couple whose relationship has hit troubled waters, resulting in a gap wider between them than what most of us saw during the days of social distancing. This becomes further aggravated when the long-term city duo relocates to the country, where Millie takes a new teaching job while Tim tries to sort out his future as a wannabe rock star. They genuinely seem to love one another, but is that enough to sustain their partnership? And, when they fall prey to a series of odd paranormal experiences that simultaneously drive them emotionally further apart while bringing them physically closer together (literally) than they ever could have imagined, their lives and world are turned upside down. In telling their story, the filmmaker seeks to make a statement about the challenges and joys that can accompany long-term romances, using a horror context as the backdrop for the exploration of these notions. And, while this approach may have some laudable merits on paper, the execution of this idea nevertheless leaves much to be desired, leading viewers through a series of underdeveloped and unrelated episodes that collectively fail to gel. Sadly, whatever connections were being sought after here are often scattered, employing a variety of tropes that just don’t mesh well. The film is at times romantic, at times modestly frightening and at times comedically campy, but it never settles on a consistent path as the story plays out. What’s more, the chemistry between the two leads is never truly convincing, making one wonder why these two partners are together in the first place and how they’ve managed to stay together as long as they have. In short, this offering ironically never really hangs “together” in my estimation, a major letdown for what was supposed to be one of the most anticipated releases of the summer movie season. Unfortunately, though, this typifies what has happened with so many of today’s horror flicks, including many of the more ambitious projects that have sought to raise the bar for this genre. Indeed, there’s not much to see here, folks, so my recommendation is to simply move along.",

Luckily there is a pool there so they don’t suffer from thirst before awakening in the morning and clambering out. No harm done, it appears, until poor old “Tim” goes to take a shower and finds he is no longer master of his own movements. He bounces around that shower cubicle like something magnetic is manipulating him.

The ending isn’t the best, it sort of fizzles out disappointingly but along the way there is a bit more of a story to it, Franco and Brie gel well as they master the art of painful looking body-popping and the visual effects are creepy and effective.

  "content": "With “Everything, Everywhere….” (2022) and “The Last Showgirl” (2024) recently under her belt, you just know that Jamie Lee Curtis is going to give her part in this everything she’s got, and she has great fun as the grandmother “Tess” in their quite imaginative rehash of the original from twenty-odd years ago. This time, the body swapping has not just seen her and daughter “Anna” (Lindsay Lohan) change places, but her own daughter “Harper” (Julia Butters) and her best friend “Lily” (Sophia Hammons) who just happens to be the daughter of “Eric” (Manny Jacinto) to whom “Anna” is shortly to be married. Now the four of them have to find some way of getting back into their own bodies before “Ryan” (Mark Harmon) has his increasingly eccentric girlfriend “Tess” put in sleeveless jacket whilst “Anna” has to convince her own daughter that her new marriage plans won’t affect their relationship. The men in this film are pretty hopeless. Harmon is as wooden as one of the chopsticks that could be used in the new restaurant of “Eric”, who doesn’t look old enough to have a teenage daughter and sports some sort of faux British accent that attempts to legitimise the plot’s grand scheme to relocate his new family to London. Butters and Hammons don’t really have so much to do and are adequate, but the thrust of the comedy and the writing is manna from heaven for a Lohan and Curtis who are clearly enjoying this daft romp down memory lane. It uses the three generations (and their gaps) entertainingly pinging fashion, music, sexist and ageist attitudes as it goes, whilst shamelessly ogling the out-of-his-depth record store owner “Jake” (Chad Michael Murray) whose sexy arrival reminded me of one of those old Nick Kamen 501 ads. It does run out of steam a bit towards the end as it succumbs to a little too much yucky sentiment, but JLC crawling along the floor doing her “stretching” and Lohan showing us how definitely not to flirt are a good laugh. They do say that youth is wasted on the young!",

It’s a love letter to a subgenre often dismissed, yet one that, when done right, can provoke genuine, infectious laughter like few others.\r\n\r\nLiam Neeson leads a cast fully committed to the silliness, with a script that honors the legacy of one of the most beloved comedy franchises of the 20th century. For longtime fans, I imagine it’s a nostalgic and comforting trip down memory lane. For newcomers like me, it’s the perfect gateway into the world of Frank Drebin (Jr.).\r\n\r\nA simple, light, and above all, tremendously funny film – exactly what cinema should also be.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

  "content": "**Review: The Naked Gun (2025) – A Goofball Reboot That Delivers Laughs, But Lacks the Original's Bite**\r\n\r\nDirector Akiva Schaffer’s The Naked Gun (2025) revives the iconic spoof franchise with Liam Neeson stepping into the oversized shoes of Frank Drebin Jr., son of Leslie Nielsen’s legendary bumbling detective. While the film captures the absurd spirit of the ZAZ (Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker) classics, it’s a mixed bag of inspired gags and missed opportunities, earning its place as a fun—if uneven—successor 15.\r\n( @ https://purocine-hd.blogspot.com/2025/07/the-naked-gun-2025-movie.html )\r\n\r\nThe Good: A Worthy Homage with Modern Twists\r\nLiam Neeson’s Deadpan Buffoonery: Neeson’s gravelly gravitas is repurposed for comedy, playing Drebin Jr. as a rogue cop parodying his own Taken persona. His delivery of lines like “I’m sure it’s Carrie who writes!” (when asked about Miranda rights) lands well, though he lacks Nielsen’s innocent charm 19.\r\n\r\nPamela Anderson’s Scene-Stealing Turn: As femme fatale Beth Davenport, Anderson shines with comedic timing, especially in a bizarre snowman ménage à trois sequence and scat-singing bits. Critics praise her as a revelation 56.\r\n\r\nJoke Density: The film packs rapid-fire puns (“UCLA?” “I see it every day!”), meta gags (the villain’s “P.L.O.T. Device”), and slapstick (Drebin biting gun barrels). The “chili dog intestinal calamity” scene is a standout 19.\r\n\r\nVisual Upgrades: Schaffer’s dynamic cinematography (e.g., swooping fight scenes) modernizes the franchise’s flat TV aesthetic, though some argue it undercuts the original’s minimalist hilarity 9.",

  "content": "That trailer with the little girl going into the bank left me dreading this. I thought it was going to be terrible, but it isn’t. It is very much a respectful homage to all things “Airplane” and “Naked Gun” from years gone by and Liam Neeson and Pamela Anderson have entered into the spirit of this entertainingly. There is the thinnest of plots about a megalomaniac technology mogul “Cane” (Danny Huston) who has a gizmo that can calm everyone up instead of down. “Drebin” (Neeson) is the son of the legendary “Police Squad” father and he has to try to thwart these evil plans in the face of both a shrewd enemy and his ruthless enforcer “Sig” (Kevin Durand) as well as with his own under-pressure boss (CCH Pounder) who keeps threatening to shut him down! When a body is discovered in an electric car in a river, he is introduced to the victim’s sister “Beth” (Anderson) and soon this pair are working in tandem. Can they stop the New Years’s balls from dropping? Jeopardy there isn’t, but if you remember those other films you’ll appreciate the double-entendres, the literal expressions - “take a seat”… “no thanks, I have some at home already” - kind of thing, and the entire ensemble seem to be up for hamming things up (especially Durand who is about as intimidating as yesterday’s toast) as we head to an enjoyable denouement that squeals predicable and sequel in equal measure. Anderson is on great form as she delivers her lines in an “ok, cue Pam”, stilted, sort of fashion. It also benefits greatly from being tightly scripted, edited and put together. It’s not even ninety minutes long so there isn’t really time for us to tire of the joke. It is good fun, silly and a bit puerile, put still a good laugh.",

  "content": "An old adage in Hollywood advises against remaking the classics given that, with few exceptions, most fail to live up to the quality of the originals. So it’s always a pleasant surprise when a reboot comes along that defies the conventional wisdom. Such is the case with this wild, wacky, sidesplittingly hysterical installment in the “Naked Gun” franchise, the first since the 1994 release of “The Naked Gun 33-1/3: The Final Insult.” To call this offering a remake per se isn’t entirely accurate; it’s more of a continuation of the franchise’s mythology, even though it’s also an origin story of sorts featuring the start of the legacy of Detective Frank Drebin Jr. (Liam Neeson), son of the late infamously incompetent but always-triumphant Detective Frank Drebin Sr. (Leslie Nielsen). As with this series’ prior releases, the story here is basically incidental, serving primarily as a vehicle for carrying the endless stream of hilariously silly bits, sight gags and slapstick humor that have come to characterize the zany nature of these films. Essentially, though, the younger Drebin intrepidly, albeit it ineptly, seeks to solve the mysterious death of an electronics genius in a fatal car crash that’s initially chalked up to suicide but that may actually be murder to cover up a bigger and more fiendish plot. Aiding Drebin is his trusty sidekick, Ed Hocken Jr. (Paul Walter Hauser), son of his dad’s late wing man, Ed Hocken Sr. (George Kennedy), and the sister of the deceased (Pamela Anderson), a blonde bombshell femme fatale who frequently and brilliantly steals scenes with her unexpected but often-unassuming antics. While most of the gags land solidly and consistently (including some very off-the-wall material), there are a few times when the picture tries a little too hard, but they are far more the exception than the rule. Along the way, the narrative also incorporates nods to an array of other releases, such as the “Mission: Impossible” and “Kingsman” movies, as well as passing homages to its predecessor pictures. At the same time, though, this offering deliberately introduces aspects of the protagonist’s character and back story that are all his own, efforts to clearly set it apart from predecessor films. That’s smart filmmaking, to be sure: A picture that pays tribute to its heritage while simultaneously establishing its own destiny, a release sure to make series creators Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker proud of what their successors have produced. Much of the credit for that goes to writer-director Akiva Schaffer, as well as the undoubtedly influential hand of producer Seth MacFarlane, whose presence here may be somewhat low key but is nevertheless undeniable. Kudos also go out to the fine ensemble, performers who absolutely rose to the occasion when needed, vanquishing the doubt that many may have held about them before the picture’s release. In fact, that could be said about “The Naked Gun” as a whole: I’ll admit to having my doubts about whether the cast and crew would be able to pull this off, but they did – and skillfully at that. It’s a genuine pleasure to once again see a comedy in a theater that actually makes me laugh out loud, something I haven’t done to this degree in quite some time. So, to put it modestly, I guess you can probably tell I really liked this one.",

  "content": "The Naked Gun is written by Dan Gregor, Doug Mand, and Akira Schaffer, while Schaffer also directs. The Gregor, Mand, and Schaffer were also behind Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers. The new film is not only homage to The Naked Gun franchise, but also to 1990s comedy in general. The comedy in the film is strictly gag after gag with little breaks in between. The story is basic and barely followed; it’s strictly there to help bridge the downtime from one gag to the next. The majority of the film rips off other big action films.\r\n\r\nThe trailer and references to characters from the other films make this clear, but this is a legacy sequel to The Naked Gun 331/3: The Final Insult and not a reboot. Lt. Frank Drebin Jr (Liam Neeson) is the son of Leslie Nielsen’s version of the character, but not the baby at the end of The Final Insult. It’s said that Liam Neeson’s character is a child from a relationship Frank Drebin didn’t know he fathered and is much older.  \r\n\r\nThe film opens with a bank heist lifted straight out of The Dark Knight (complete with music that sounds similar to Hans Zimmer/James Newton Howard’s score). Frank takes out all the bank robbers by himself, but not before the P.L.O.T. Device is stolen, which was the real target. Drebin begins investigating the death of Simon Davenport, who worked for Edentech mastermind Richard Cane (Danny Huston).\r\n\r\nCane intends to use the P.L.O.T. Device to devolve humanity back to their barbaric Neanderthal ways. The rich will hunker down until the poor and mediocre all kill each other, while the wealthy can rule what remains of the world (a la Kingsman). While Frank believes Simon committed suicide, his sister Beth (Pamela Anderson) tries to convince him otherwise. Frank and Beth begin working together to thwart Cane’s plan.\r\n\r\nLike Rescue Rangers, the comedy of The Naked Gun is extremely hit or miss. Some of the gags work incredibly well, including an infrared sequence that looks like Frank and Beth (and a dog) are committing sexual acts on each other, and a romantic montage involving a snowman that is the most outrageous part of the film.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, the comedy isn’t necessarily straightforward, but its spitfire formula is somewhat exhausting at times and feels like something that wouldn’t be as enjoyable on repeat viewings of the film. On the other hand, though, there are some aspects to the film hidden in the background, like Easter eggs that may only be caught on the second or third viewing.\r\n\r\nThere are some truly hysterical moments in The Naked Gun; Frank and Cane’s lengthy conversation on the Black Eyed Peas and Frank’s rant about TiVo to Beth are the memorable cream of a ridiculous crop.\r\n\r\nThere’s a Daffy Duck Looney Tunes short from 1948 called Daffy Dilly. A tycoon named J.B. Cubish will pay $1 million to the first person who makes him laugh. Daffy tries everything in his comedic arsenal, but nothing works until Daffy clumsily trips and falls and makes Cubish laugh hysterically. The end of the short sees Cubish throwing pie after pie at Daffy’s face while laughing uncontrollably.\r\n\r\nThe Naked Gun’s comedy is essentially throwing pie after pie at the audience and seeing what sticks or will be remembered. It just keeps piling on. Maybe you like pie, but having them thrown at your face for 80 minutes, regardless of whether they’re different flavors or not, becomes redundant, overwhelming, and overkill.\r\n\r\nThe whole point of the Naked Gun franchise is that there isn’t a structure apart from making way for the over-the-top silliness. It looks like the film was a ton of fun to make because all of the performances are just as preposterous as the rest of the film. But maybe The Naked Gun is too on the nose and captures an era of comedy that doesn’t work as well anymore.\r\n\r\nOur attention spans may not be what they used to be, but a handful of seconds of story sandwiched between six excessive gags, a dozen absurd one-liners, and Liam Neeson choking down chili dogs so he can crap his pants for a longer period is excessive.\r\n\r\nThere are some fun and hilarious moments in The Naked Gun, but it’s a barrage of slapstick comedy with unlimited ammo regarding its ludicrous content. The film is a lot like having a thousand punchlines to one joke or one setup. People enjoy gag reels from movies, but The Naked Gun is like 700 gag reels stitched together to make a somewhat cohesive film.",

  "content": "Liam Neeson is the one bright spot in director Akiva Schaffer‘s otherwise disappointing reboot of “The Naked Gun.” His deadpan delivery and complete commitment to absurdity prove he was the right actor to inherit the legacy of Leslie Nielsen’s iconic Lt. Frank Drebin, but even he can’t carry the film all by himself. With a script peppered with unfunny Millennial pop culture references and mostly lazy, ill-timed jokes, this is one of the biggest disappointments of the year.\r\n\r\nFor the first half, it’s a promising, chuckle-filled ride with a couple of inspired gags that even had me laughing to the point of tears. But then something goes horribly wrong. The laughs evaporate, the energy dies, and the film collapses into a pit of painfully unfunny slapstick and stale parody.\r\n\r\nWhat starts off as a decent spoof with real comedic potential quickly devolves into a slog of cheap, juvenile humor that never lands. The story is serviceable and the tone mimics the original ridiculousness of the original films, but the second half is so lacking in wit or timing that it feels like a completely different (and far worse) movie.\r\n\r\nIt’s frustrating, because this could have worked. Neeson is great, and there are flashes of brilliance in the form of creative sight gags and one-liners, but they’re buried in a script that runs out of steam far too early.\r\n\r\nInstead of revitalizing the beloved franchise, “The Naked Gun” limps to the finish line with the kind of sophomore-level comedy that makes you cringe more than laugh.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

  "content": "Now I don’t suppose you’d have kicked “Prince Julian” (Isac Calmroth) out of bed for eating herring, but right from the start this apple of everyone’s eye looks distinctly dull! I’m not sure that the besotted “Elvira” (Lea Myren) realised that when she embarked on quite a tortuous make-over to turn her chubby and buck-toothed body into something that might turn the head of this royal highness, but needs must when the debt collectors are circling. This is probably the most grotesque take on the “Cinderella” story you are ever like to see, as it pretty graphically shows the life of this young girl, her stepsister, her mother and her downright cruel Svengali who thinks nothing of stitching her eyelids on or rearranging her teeth - without, of course, any anaesthetic. Where this also drifts away from the more traditional approach is the venality of the whole thing. “Elvira” is certainly a victim of greed, but it’s more a sort of uneducated and vulgar kind from her guardian rather than anything more spiteful or hateful. Moot point? Well, not really as in the end it is actually quite difficult to actually loathe this family desperate to climb the silky pole. I almost felt sorry for all of them. It’s gory, there’s a fair smattering of sex and our princeling can even turn his hand to poetry - though not the stuff that Yeats might have to worry about. The production has been eerily and effectively crafted with plenty of detail in the settings and costumes, and the overall message of style over substance and social and sexual conformity is writ large throughout. It turns out that there are more ways than one to get your foot in that slipper, and not all of this will be for the squeamish. I enjoyed this dark, occasionally comedic and poignant look at just what we’ll do to for love, lust and lucre.",

  "content": "As a massive Looney Tunes fan, it was questionable whether or not The Day the Earth Blew Up would even see the light of day let alone be released theatrically. Originally conceived as an HBO Max (now Max) original, the company decided not to release it at all.\r\n\r\nUnlike Bye Bye Bunny: A Looney Tunes Musical which was canceled mid-production and Coyote vs. Acme which is a fully completed film that was shelved, The Day the Earth Blew Up was shopped around to other distributors where GFM Animation picked it up for theatrical distribution.\r\n\r\nIn The Day the Earth Blew Up, Porky and Daffy have practically been together since birth. They’re raised by a burly, bearded, lumberjack-looking farmer named Farmer Jim. As the two grow up together, Daffy is the crazier of the two whereas Porky kind of goes with whatever Daffy does without voicing how he feels.\r\n\r\nAfter Farmer Jim waddles off into the sunset (literally), Porky and Daffy are left with his home which they run into the ground over a handful of years. After trying to tend to various minor repairs before a neighborhood standards review, they are given ten days to fix the gigantic hole in their roof that they somehow overlooked. Otherwise, their house will be condemned.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a meteor has crash-landed on Earth which smashes through Porky and Daffy’s roof upon entry. The meteor brings a strange bright green alien goo with it. After Porky and Daffy struggle to find a job to help pay for their roof, gum flavor scientist Petunia Pig comes along and offers them jobs at the Goodie Gum factory.\r\n\r\nHowever, the scientist who discovered the meteor has been brainwashed by the goo and dumps more goo into the factory’s latest gum flavor batch that is shipping worldwide. Whoever chews this infected batch is turned into a gum-chewing zombie and the only one that knows about it is a lunatic duck that nobody believes.\r\n\r\nThe Day the Earth Blew Up takes a ton of influence from Bob Clampett; not only from the Looney Tunes shorts he directed but his animation style as well. The film is traditional animation, which means it’s hand-drawn, and every line of dialogue has a variety of memorable facial expressions that feel like they’re lifted straight out of The Great Piggy Bank Robbery (1946).\r\n\r\nThe animated sci-fi comedy has a long list of influences including several Bob Clampett shorts from 1946 including Kitty Kornered and Baby Bottleneck, old school creature features such as The Thing and Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and surprisingly a meteor drilling story point that feels like it’s lifted straight out of Armageddon or The Core.\r\n\r\nThe film has a whopping 11 credited writers and four story consultants, which after watching the film isn’t surprising. The film changes course and objectives countless times over an all-too-quick 90 minutes. For those unaware, when HBO Max launched it was the streaming location for animated content. Part of that content was a new batch of Looney Tunes Cartoons that ran for six seasons. These new shorts took heavy inspiration from the original Looney Tunes with crisp animation, were still totally gag-driven, and even had a more adult kind of vibe much like Ren and Stimpy.\r\n\r\nThe Day the Earth Blew Up was created during that Looney Tunes Cartoons stint on Max, so it has similar high-quality animation. The film toys with lighting in a way that makes it feel like a classic horror film with drastic color changes and heavy shadows. And the monster and alien designs are so much fun. The lead alien, known only as The Invader, has a plan for Earth that is too absurd not to love.\r\n\r\nThe Day the Earth Blew Up deserves all of the support it can get. The film feels like a last chance for the Looney Tunes franchise to be successful. Traditional animation is also rare these days. When the inevitable embrace of AI is just around the corner and everything animated relies on CGI these days, hand-drawn animation hasn’t looked this good since Cuphead.\r\n\r\nThe Day the Earth Blew Up is a crazy unique take on alien invasion and zombie films with a Looney Tunes twist that is fun and hysterical. The eye-popping animation is gorgeous and glorious. This is a film for Looney Tunes fans, horror, sci-fi, and film fans alike. It captures the magic of the classics while delivering something entirely fresh and worthwhile.",

  "content": "Well, one off from two of this year's most expected movies alongside 'The Battle of Five Armies'. Like all the Chris Nolan fans, I was equally excited to see the movie on the opening day opening show. But I slightly disappointed that it was not a digital 3D film. I agree, this science-fiction was more dramatized than usual space travel stories does with an adventure-thriller. Almost a 3 hour long stretch movie did not waste much time to take us to the core of the story. Get prepared for this extremely rare voyage into the space with a logical explanation for everything you see on the screen. Well done research for the most matured and intelligent writing. All the credit must go to Nolan brothers. A good sign from Jonathan Nolan, who can make big in the entertainment industry in a future like his brother.\r\n\r\nAs we know many had liked 'Inception', to me that was a simple multi-layered action movie, that's all. But the same stuffs that used in this film makes sense. In fact, you have to have a little knowledge over how the universe works, so then it will be easy to catch the scene and situations while watching the movie. Totally like a documentary style concept, but with the additional stuffs like characters and its emotions add flavor that gives a movie look. An educational movie, though it also can work for those who wants just entertainment. Only the slow movie pace would test their patience.\r\n\r\nIt all begins like Shyamalan's 'Signs' movie with a family living surrounded by corn field. Then switches to 'The Astronaut Farmer' and going through 'Gravity', finally meets the 'Inception'. It was just a reference to call the movie setting that brings constant change for every half an hour. Like the opening scene and the end scene had over a 100 years difference.\r\n\r\nAs I earlier said it was the story of a family alongside the future of humankind and decoding universal mysteries through travelling in space and time. This movie would a reasonable for those who thought '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a boring piece, Cleverly written cinematic piece especially for science geeks. I don't know how perfect the movie to the actual present astrophysics, but will justify for the common people's capacity of understanding with an encourageable amount of commercial elements in it to entertain as well.\r\n\r\nThe first three quarters of the movie was well made. It puts me in a unblinkable position like a story was narrated by Brian Cox in a television series. Like I said, lots of astrophysics involved in it, but strangely human emotions were also exhibited equally that I never expected one from Nolan film. It was not an ordinary sentiment, but was strong enough to make a man cry for happy and sad situations in the movie. I liked science and emotion coming together. In fact, it saved the movie, otherwise it would have been a science documentary straight from NASA production through Nolan direction.\r\n\r\nThere are many surprise elements in the movie and of course there is a twist at the end. We can call it a series of twists like the layers. Compared to last quarter of the movie to the rest, it completely detaches which opens broadly to the different directions. And that happens so fast rushing towards the other end. Which give an impression of the movie 'Inception'. In a perfect way to say the first 75% was 'The Tree of Life' and the remains are 'Inception'.\r\n\r\n‘‘This world's a treasure,\r\nbut it's been telling us to leave for a while now.’’\r\n\r\nAll the actors were so good. Matthew McConaughey steals the show as he dominates the majority of the screen space in the story presentation. There's no ruling out the fine performance executions from Anne Hathaway and the young star from the Twilight movie, Mackenzie Foy. The remaining cast was having less scope which were like the guest appearances that was widened a little broader, but was perfectly fitted for the story. Especially Matt Damon's was the crucial one.\r\n\r\nRemember the movie 'Contact', a lovely movie, which was ruined by its fictional ending. Something like that happened in this film as well. The story was initiated with a realistic approach with actual scientific contents as per the present understanding about the universe. But the end was let me down with the layered contents that kind of impossible to agree with it. As a cinematic theme it worked, yeah, a good solution for this wonderfully written story. We know that the time can't run backwards, so that's the trouble.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this movie defines in a new way, I mean scientifically the existence of ghost. It was not a horror movie, but I liked supernatural force that merged with this science fiction theme. That explains and gives vast ideas to expand our physics beyond something and somewhere yet to reach. Hats off to the director, because he was not thinking of making money here. His idea was to implement what the humans are understood so far about the cosmos. And he very nicely transformed those into the silver screen with the blend of human emotions. In my opinion, this will replace '2001: A Space Odyssey' for sometime till another one make this way.\r\n\r\nI could have not asked a better space travel drama than this, especially when I heard Nolan doing a science-fiction I believed he gonna rock it. He was so true to the science and the human feelings in this film. If you had seen enough movies before like this one, you can recall your memories like the Tom Hanks parts from 'Cloud Atlas'. But still independently stands strong and falls in a never seen before category.\r\n\r\n‘‘Maybe we've spent too long\r\ntrying to figure all this out with theory.’’\r\n\r\nThe end scene leaves a hint of a possible sequel. I would be happy if that happen in a near future, but definitely that would be a completely different cinema as per how this one ended. I know his fans want that to happen and so am I.\r\n\r\nThe visuals were not that great, but simply very good. To see those in digital 3D would have given us a different experience, sadly Nolan was not in favor of that technology. Hoping this movie would get as many as the Oscars nod. Especially not getting into the best motion picture shortlist would be a shame. Like I said I'm no one fan, I just love watching everyone's every movie. I would have went to see it again if it was converted into digital 3D, since I'm modern tech geek when it comes to the films.\r\n\r\nIt will become a talk of the week, perhaps month all over the world, so don't leave behind when your friends talk about it. What I gonna say is it is a must see asap if you are a movie fanatic like me otherwise Nolan movies does not need anyone's recommendation because his movies usually sell itself like the hot samosa.",

  "content": "People seem to think that if you enjoy a Christopher Nolan movie, you are a fanboy and the film couldn't really be that good. That is not true. He has never made a bad movie, Insomnia is probably his worst and it is still an excellent movie. \r\nInterstellar is up there in his top 3, with The Dark Knight being number 1 and Inception in number 2. I don't think he will ever make a better movie than The Dark Knight, it is without a doubt a masterpiece of cinema in my opinion. It can be enjoyed on so many levels.\r\nI remember seeing Interstellar in the movie theater and being on the edge of my seat the whole time. It was breathtaking but the end left me confused so i walked out disappointed. \r\nSince then i have watched it many times but it only took a second viewing to realize what a great ending it is and here is why. How many people discuss the end, was the wormhole open or closed for him to make it to Brand, what happens next, is there a sequel. I discuss this with people who hate the movie and the debate will still last a good 30 minutes if not more without getting heated. It is a wonderful story told through the eyes of a genius film maker who deserves more than he receives, an oscar would be nice start.\r\nI read hat his next movie is to be released in July 2017, I can't wait to find out everything about it like i have since he began.\r\nIf you're unsure about Christopher Nolan, watch his career from the beginning starting with Doodlebug.",

The photography is very nice but the movie commits all the same mistakes than previous Nolan's movies. I think mistakes but it may be that they are the points Nolan fans enjoy the most ...\r\n\r\n* The story makes you believe it is a realy deeply thought plot but, in the end, it has so basic mistakes and stupidities that make it nonsensical.\r\n* There is a general ambience of every moment being epic; deep, solemn and smart dialogues but, at some point our highly trained engineer and pilot behaves really stupidly.\r\n* To keep the mentioned constant feeling of being in an epic moment, Nolan uses a thumping and insistent soundtrack. As it is not a moment, but a 3h movie, it is really tiresome.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the movie is OK but you can only think this is a great movie if you are a real Nolan fan.",

  "content": "\"Man kind was born on earth, it was never meant to die here.\"\r\n\r\nIT has been two days since I watched it and I still can't get it out of my head. I can safely say that it has been a long LONG time since a movie had this much effect on me after watching it. And the only thing I can think of now is to somehow Re-Watch it again.\r\n\r\nThis movie was surprisingly different from Christopher Nolan's recent works because they had been great cinematic entertainment pieces catered to a wider audience with a blockbuster approach, this certainly didn't felt like that and hence the polarizing response it got. It is an ambitious project that is not meant to merely entertain, walk into it knowing that. I'll say this though, If it works for you, you'll be in heaven.\r\n\r\nThe premise of the movie is that Earth is no longer capable of supporting humans on it, we must find a new home to avoid extinction. This scenario is told from a very personal perspective and not from a Global scale like some sort of apocalyptic catastrophe disaster film. At the core of the movie is the Father-Daughter relationship. The movie takes its sweet time to develop it too.\r\n\r\nMathew McConaughey, not surprisingly, gives an amazing performance as the main lead. He really carries the film, some scenes were very emotional due to his great performance. The rest of the cast does a great job as well, especially the Daughter played by Meckenzie Foy. The One character that I never expected to be great was the robot TARS. He also acted as the source of the humor in the movie, well executed, timely and grounded.\r\n\r\nInterstellar tackles a lot of themes, Survival, Humankind, Love, Time etc, out of which 'Time' had the biggest impact on me. With relativity being a big part in the film, the whole sequence about it just struck me very deeply and I found new respect for Time. I'm actually at a loss of words to describe it. Also, there is a lot science in it so it can be confusing for many and in Nolan's tradition, it also has twists and mind numbing ending, where the more you think about it, the more numbing it gets.\r\n\r\nThe visuals of this movie are breathtaking. Great cinematography and CGI. The depiction of wormholes and blackholes and other space entities were the best I have ever seen. They just suck you into the movie. Along with that, you get to listen to one of Hans Zimmer's best scores. The score not only felt personal, going perfectly with the movie, but also different from his recent works. There were times where combination of epic photography and soundtrack made the scenes timeless, like I was completely sucked into it and didn't had a clue about my surroundings. I didn't want those scenes to end.\r\n\r\nAlas, the movie was not perfect. My biggest gripe with it is that the pacing and editing was off at times. Some scenes dragged on while others were cut far shorter. The beautiful views of space could have definitely benefited from a few seconds longer onscreen time. Also, I wished there was more space exploration in it.\r\n\r\nWith all the remakes, rehashes, reboots and sequels we are getting in these times, it is great to see original gems like these. This movie is definitely one of this year's best, one of Nolan's best work and one of the best movie I have seen in recent years.\r\n\r\n9.5/10",

  "content": "This was my most anticipated film of 2014, and I was not disappointed. \r\n\r\nThe story was slightly difficult to follow on the first watch, but that was to be expected in a film dealing with complicated fields such as astrophysics and time dilation. Many didn't find its overall message - that love is the most powerful force in the universe which transcends space and time - to be very appealing, but I thought it was an interesting take on special relativity and how two people can be bound by a common feeling, even when they're in different parts of the universe at different times. I also thought the acting was believable, for the most part, and I didn't think anyone was miscast. I enjoyed the surprise appearance from a certain famous actor about halfway through.\r\n\r\nBut what really blew me away were the visuals and the soundtrack. I believe it was Quentin Tarantino who once said movies and music go hand in hand; that a moving image complimented by the right piece of music can create art. Well, the visuals in this film, which took my breath away, and the score, which perfectly captured the 'feel' of the cosmos and all its wonder, proved him right. I think this was Hans Zimmer's best work yet, and although I'm not Christopher Nolan's biggest fan, I will continue to follow his work if he can pull off more movies like this. \r\n\r\nMy only regret was not seeing this film in IMAX.\r\n\r\n10/10",

  "content": "That this movie, at the time of writing this, holds an 8.8 rating at IMDb is simply beyond my understanding. Needless to say I did not really like this movie. The story is not very good, the science is ludicrous and the visuals not all that impressive. Maybe the latter would be better in a big theater (I watched this on my home cinema system which has a relatively large screen by European standards) but I am not really sure about that either.\r\n\r\nBe warned that the rest of this review might contain a spoiler or two.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts of with the usual “I told you so” wet dream of the green fanatics on a dying Earth so it is off to a depressing start right away. That is an overused concept today as far as I am concerned. Then they pour it on with a school official claiming that he Apollo missions and moon landings never happened. What the f…? If they wanted to depress the audience right from the start they succeeded, at least with this audience.\r\n\r\nThe story proceeds with our heroes finding these gravity waves in the sand and by a huge stretch of imagination decrypts them to mean coordinates which leads them to the secret NASA base. Once there Cooper is told that he is their best choice of pilot for a “save the human race” mission through a wormhole. Yeah, right! This guy was former NASA. His whereabouts could hardly been unknown to them. If he was their best choice why would they entrust a mission to save the human race to someone else until he stumbled onto their door? Typical Hollywood nonsense!\r\n\r\nThe movie is full of this kind of rubbish. Romilly wastes 23 years of his life doing pretty much nothing except deciding not to go into the sleep capsule. The supposedly highly trained and vetted professor that they do find turns out to be a psychopath as well as and idiot almost blowing up the ship when trying to proceed with a docking that all the systems tells him have not succeeded. Then they proceed to dock with the main ship and stop its spin as well as bring it out of orbit around a planet with the shuttles engines. That is one hell of a powerful shuttle not to mention the strength of the docking mechanism! This just goes on. When someone is not doing something illogical or stupid (or both) they sit around talking, philosophizing and dragging the movie forward at snails pace. 169 minutes is way too much for this movie.\r\n\r\nThe movie ends up in one big time travel mess (okay they do not travel in time, just sends messages through time but still…) during a bunch of psychedelic scenes while traveling through the back hole. Science? Not so much. And what about this totally ludicrous massively illogical and inefficient robot design?\r\n\r\nThe one good thing I can say about this movie is that the performance of most of the actors, especially Matthew McConaughey, are quite good. For the rest, not my cup of tea.",

I'm really into space and everything about it, so this movie was my cup of tea. \r\nThe soundtrack is the best of the movie. It points out flow of time, which is the most discussed issue in the movie. Special effects are breathtaking. Even with some small mistakes, it is pretty accurate and expectable. There is some visually pleasing cinematography too, including Saturn, the curvature of spacetime or majestic black hole, which is really satisfying. Some scenes are loud and thrilling, but some moments are so quiet, that you actually think, you are in space!\r\nThe movie is long but gripping. The plot, although it's complicated, is told easily and understandably. But the end of the movie is difficult to understand, since it contains time loop and time travel at the same time, but if you listen carefully, you will get it. I watched the movie 7 times and I still enjoy it!",

Rage, rage against the dying of the light\".\r\n\r\nThe story is about a team of explorers undertakes the most important mission in human history; traveling beyond this galaxy to discover whether mankind has a future among the stars.\r\n\r\nChristopher Nolan once said that 2001: A Space Odyssey was his all time favorite film and how he wanted to do a small tribute to he's next film. And then comes a movie called \"Interstellar\" that will put a smile on Kubrick face if he was alive today, because Interstellar is one of the best movie of 2014 and the best movie experience I've had at the cinema.\r\n\r\nI saw this movie in IMAX and all through out this film I felt like I was in space floating around with Mconaughey and Anne Hathaway. I had that feeling that I was going deep into space just like are main character's, going deep into space just like the viewing auditions and me.\r\n\r\nThe visual effect's in this movie are some of the most stunning, beautiful and Jaw dropping effect's I've seen since 2001: A Space Odyssey. The performances were brilliant, The cinematography was breathtaking and hard to look away. The directing by Christopher Nolan and let me get this out there, this man is a true director; he knows cinema and knows how to interested people into seeing he's films and I'm still shocked that he hasn't won an Oscar yet.\r\n\r\nNow most people or critics have said that last third of this movie ruined the movie for them, but I actually like the ending to the movie. It's new for Nolan because he always ends on a deep and cold note, but this movie didn't and I didn't mind it.\r\n\r\nMy only nick pick with the movie is some of the character's in this movie wasn't all that interesting. Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are the only character's that to me were interesting and I cared for them, but the rest of the character's I didn't really care for.\r\n\r\nOverall Interstellar is a mind-blowing movie with fantastic visual's, interesting story line and the movie will keep you interested till the end.",

Apparently a physicist was involved who had veto power if the script wandered out of the realm of what is at least theoretically true or possible.\r\n\r\nBut I have never let inaccuracies get in the way of enjoying science fiction movies anyway, as long as the movie is entertaining and otherwise doesn’t insult my intelligence. In the movie Monsters, for example, I read that giant the aliens looking like octopuses could not have walked upright. Fair enough, but it is entertainment, not a documentary.\r\n\r\nSo the human story of Interstellar held my attention in spite of the length of the film, and despite the elaborate special effects, that story drove the movie and my appreciation of it. I have always liked good time travel movies as well, and theories of space and time come into play in Interstellar as well.\r\n\r\nOh, and I say it is entertainment rather than a documentary, but it is not light entertainment. If you want to give this movie a fair chance, give it your full attention. It is not Mars Attacks, where you can watch it while distracted by life and still pick up on  plot details.",

  "content": "The geeky young “Elio” has been orphaned into the care of his military aunt “Olga” who works for Uncle Sam helping folks to navigate the debris that’s floating around in outer space. He likes to speak his own language “Elioese” and is fascinated, obsessed even, with making contact with alien life. He’s convinced that there is intelligent life out there, so imagine his surprise when he hears of a possible response from the Voyager mission sent decades ago. Next thing, well he is transported to the kaleidoscopic “communiverse” where everyone share peace, knowledge and friendship. Well, nearly everyone. The nasty “Grigon” wants to join but when they politely decline he threatens them with obliteration - and a verifiable obliteration at that. Clever these folks may be, but fighters they are not so it falls to “Elio” to prove his worth by trying to negotiate some sort of truce! Off to the big warship he goes, and that’s where he meets “Glordon” and learns a great deal more about his potential foe, and about friendship and loyalty as they embark on some lively escapades. Now there’s not a great deal here that could ever be called original. It’s got plenty of themes and tech rehashed from films gone by, but it’s still an enjoyable and fun tale with a message that resonates engagingly. It challenges stereotypes on just about everything from machismo bullying to parenting and cuddling and though the visuals are up to their usual high standard, fluid, imaginative and colourful, they don’t overwhelm the simplicity of the thrust which is a story about trust friendship. Will you recall it this time next year? Well no - probably not, but it keeps clear enough of too much sentiment, has some tea-time menace, mischief, laser cannons and it also reminded me of when I had a radio ham call sign too.",

  "content": "Elio is a heartwarming, intergalactic adventure that once again proves Pixar's mastery in crafting family-friendly stories layered with deeper emotional undercurrents. The voice cast is impeccable, with every performance radiating charm and sincerity, making it easy for viewers of all ages to connect with these vibrant characters. The score, as is typical for the studio, plays a pivotal role in guiding the emotional journey, gently elevating moments of wonder, sadness, and joy without ever feeling overbearing. There's an infectious sense of fun throughout, with plenty of space-faring antics to keep kids engaged, while older audiences will find value in the themes of loneliness, grief, and the universal desire for belonging.\r\n\r\nHowever, Elio doesn't reach the emotional or narrative heights of Pixar's most iconic offerings. Its message, while undoubtedly impactful and accessible, feels too broadly framed to leave a lasting personal mark. The themes are universally relatable, but the movie's refusal to dig deeper into its more profound ideas keeps it from resonating on a soul-piercing level. It's touching, yes, but in a way that feels like a gentle nod rather than a heartfelt embrace. Still, Elio remains a commendable addition to Pixar's filmography - emotionally rich, charmingly performed, and filled with enough heartfelt moments to justify the trip across the stars.\r\n\r\nRating: B",

  "content": "Elio (Yonas Kibreab) is an 11-year-old boy who has recently lost his parents. He’s been taken in by his aunt Olga (Zoe Saldana). Olga works in orbital analysis and is gone a lot. Feeling like he doesn’t belong anywhere and nobody wants him, Elio finds comfort in interplanetary life. He takes on an obsession with ham radios and attempts to communicate with aliens while simultaneously trying to get abducted nightly.\r\n\r\nOne night, Elio is finally abducted by aliens. He’s introduced to an incredible new environment with alien species the likes of which the human eye has never seen or interacted with. He wants to stay forever until they reveal that they think he’s the leader of Earth. Elio lies his way into the alien community, but to stay he must risk his life to save them.\r\n\r\nThere are themes in Elio that are circled back around in elegant fashion. Elio loses his family before the film even begins. He’s also weird enough that he doesn’t have any friends. The film tries to paint Elio in a creative light like he has this big imagination because he’s invented his own language and can lie himself into and out of any situation. But he mostly comes off as a shitty person that treats his hard-working aunt, who only wants to support him and for him to love her, like dirt.\r\n\r\nThe animated sci-fi adventure film is about Elio coming to terms with the loss of his parents. He feels alone, has low self-esteem, and has extreme acceptance issues. But the film explores what it’s like to find your own family made of new friends and that you’re never really as low or alone as you think you are.\r\n\r\nHe is initially shipped off to boarding school because of his uncontrollable behavior and inability to not be a destructive shit. Once he’s at the Communiverse, he meets a liquid-like supercomputer named OOOOO. She clones Elio and sends his clone back to Earth so no one will notice that he’s gone. But as Elio checks up on him, he sees what it’s like to be a family with his aunt and becomes homesick.\r\n\r\nVisually, the film is at its best when Elio is at the Communiverse. The Communiverse is filled with all sorts of alien leaders from all over the galaxy with the intent of sharing their knowledge with others and hopefully recruiting other respectable leaders. These sequences are filled with all sorts of eccentric creatures while its “alien” explanation allows things like basic physics or logic to be thrown out the window.\r\n\r\nHands down the best character and most enjoyable part of the film is Glordon. He is worm-like and his design was inspired by larval insects and microbiotic creatures like the tardigrade. His mouth seems to go on forever and is overrun with teeth kind of like a Dune sandworm. He can spin web like a spider and is heat and lava-resistant. He looks menacing and scary, but once he gets an English translator has an adorable little kid’s voice and is super expressive even though he doesn’t have any eyes. The friendship he develops with Elio has way more of an impact than the one the film forces him into with his aunt.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Elio crawls at a slug-like pace through what feels like the longest hour and a half of the summer. It struggles through its first hour as Elio lies to everyone around him, gets in way over his head with the aliens, and attempts to abandon his aunt forever. Elio’s big plan is to join the alien community and leave Earth with no intention of ever going back. But apart from the enjoyable montage of Elio showing Glordon the Communiverse, the entire movie is just “Oh no, I lied too hard and don’t know what to do now.”\r\n\r\nAnimated films and TV shows have used slow-motion before, but Elio has some of the worst slow-motion effects in the history of animation. The slow-mo here looks like it was a decision that was made in post-production as the effect doesn’t look to be part of the animation but the editing of the film itself. It’s done in a way that makes you think the projector is acting up or something. It’s so jittery and awkward looking and the intended effect is probably not whatever you see on screen.\r\n\r\nElio is visually fun to look at and it gets somewhat entertaining in its last 20 minutes or so, but is otherwise a big, disappointing bowl of intergalactic garbage. The film chooses to follow an unlikeable character who is a brat the entire time and the main takeaway is that he shouldn’t be so much of a shithead and be decent to those who actually care about him for some reason. There’s something fun and whimsical here trapped inside the body of an entitled, lie-spewing thundercunt.",

I won't say it broke new ground however I did think it was a step up from John Wick: Chapter 4. **3.5/5**",

  "content": "This isn’t a film, it’s a live action video game with a predictable plot and loads of energetically choreographed CGI to substitute for anything vaguely akin to a story. It starts with the young “Eve” (Victoria Comte) who witnesses her father’s death at the hands of “The Chancellor” (Gabriel Byrne) before being adopted into the secret society of “John Wick” by “Winston” (Ian McShane) and his drag-like boss (Angelica Huston) where she learns to combine the artistic skills of a ballerina with deadly ninja ones - as she morphs into Ana de Armas (whilst everyone else remains exactly the same). Anyway, none of that really matters as she accidentally discovers the identity of the tribe who ruined her life and despite warnings of dire consequences, sets off on a lethal mission of retribution that takes her to a Czech Republic where everyone speaks perfect English. The thing is, it appears that her gang and the one she is pursuing have a sort of unwritten truce, and given she is about to throw that under the Skoda, Angelica has no choice other than to bring out of retirement the legendary you know who. Will that make anything any different or safer or even less repetitive? It not so much that this is derivative and really quite dull, it’s that the dialogue is woeful and the constant frying pan to fire scenarios where people get used and abused are ridiculous. Knives, guns, bottles, pots, pans, kettles - even a pair of ruthlessly applied roller skates and some flamer throwers help our heroine along but it’s hilarious that they always appear just when she needs them. She’s got the points and gone up a level, She also heals as if she were the sister of “Wolverine” and no amount of training is going to remove a six inch shard of glass from your body without it impeding your ability to scale a wall and wield a pick axe. Maybe I just wasn’t in the mood, but just like the series upon which this is based, it is unoriginal and after the umpteenth time she has survived against innumerable odds to fight again just had me wondering how long until she’s back with “Ballerina II - the Pirouette”. All of that said, though, it does look good on a cinema screen and that’s where it ought to be seen. It will be even more unimpressive on a television where you can easily hit the fast-forward button.",

  "content": "_Ballerina_ is a culmination of everything that works in the John Wick universe, but also dialed up to new heights. The movie is quite a simple vengeance story at the center which is sadly left unfulfilled but it is how well every other element of the movie is taken that makes this story actually work at the end of the day. The action is the same John Wick action we know and love but with so much more creativity infused this time around, from people popping like a balloon by way of grenade to people being lit on fire like crazy. This different approach to the action of the main John Wick films, which is often cold and very mechanical, makes Ballerina stand out on its own. Of course, _Ballerina_ also stands out because of the committed efforts of Ana de Armas as Eve who the audience actually gets to care for in the movie. That's why John Wick's inclusion here seems like a massive 4th wall break because the audience is locked into Eve and her vengeful mission. Other flaws of this movie lie in character development, balance, motivation, and redemption but also in short plot points and vague plot points. Lastly, the world building in _Ballerina_ is a healthy amount, especially for a spin-off film, making the movie that much more interesting. _Ballerina_ is another stellar addition to the John Wick universe that I hope has legs to continue in the future.",

  "content": "From Australian twin filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou (Talk to Me), Bring Her Back follows brother and sister Andy (Billy Barratt) and Piper (Sora Wong). Piper is mostly blind (she can see shapes and colors) and Andy has taken care of her for as long as they can both remember.\r\n\r\nWhen Andy and Piper’s father dies suddenly, they are adopted by a woman named Laura (Sally Hawkins). Laura has a mute son named Oliver (Jonah Wren Phillips) and had a daughter who was also blind and is still grieving her death.\r\n\r\nWhat begins as an awkward transition during tragedy becomes an abhorrent struggle for survival as Andy and Piper eventually uncover what Laura has planned for them.\r\n\r\nTalk to Me was a riveting horror debut by the Philippou brothers/RackaRacka and had the benefit of being injected with the incredible concept of chasing the high that comes with being possessed. Bring Her Back is a bit more familiar as it deals with a woman attempting to bring her daughter back to life in the body of a similar vessel.\r\n\r\nCinematographer Aaron McLiskey and sound effects editors Lachlan Harris and Lee Yee deserve a ton of credit for making certain elements of Bring Her Back look and feel like someone with impaired vision is experiencing them.\r\n\r\nVisually, the film often focuses on what’s taking place in the foreground while the background is blurry with just enough movement for the brain to piece together what’s occurring. When Piper and Andy are in Wendy’s (Sally-Anne Upton) office, the woman in charge of placing them in the foster care system, the first thing you see and hear are the bracelets on Wendy’s wrist as she types.\r\n\r\nIn the sequence when Andy is driving Piper to Laura’s house for the first time the visor is down during a sunny day. Andy notices that Piper can’t see or feel the warm color of the day and puts the visor up, which sees an immediate change in Piper’s behavior and body language.\r\n\r\nAndy and Piper find their deceased father in the shower, which results in Andy having a traumatic response to showers throughout the rest of the film. During their father’s wake and every time Andy considers taking a shower, Andy has a panic attack. Andy breathes heavily and understandably looks shaken during these sequences, but it’s highlighted by the way the sounds of the world are muffled by his accelerating heartbeat.\r\n\r\nThe concept of the film is that the living situation with Laura is meant to only be a temporary thing. In three months, Andy will be old enough to apply to be Piper’s guardian. Laura, who has slowly been figuring out a way to bring her daughter back this whole time seemingly waiting for a blind girl to end up in the local foster system, meets the siblings with mind games the minute they walk in the door.\r\n\r\nLike Talk to Me, Bring Her Back is jarring and relentless at times with unsettling moments going a step beyond what would be physically comfortable. Oliver’s moment in the kitchen with the knife is a solid example. The highlight of the film is Sally Hawkins's performance. Hawkins has never shied away from challenging films, but Bring Her Back is her first interaction with the genre and she delivers in every way imaginable.\r\n\r\nLaura is a nasty character with one goal in mind and Hawkins's performance blurs the line between pure terror and actual empathy for her. While Laura downright murders people in Bring Her Back and commits all these heinous acts, she is still a mother who has never gotten over losing the person she cared about the most in this world. And part of you still feels sorry for her by the end of the film.\r\n\r\nThe juxtaposition of what Laura is presenting as a seemingly caring foster mother and the dark ritual she’s planning for Piper is somewhat disappointing. Knowing Laura’s intentions so early on in the film (it’s given away in the title and all of the marketing of the film) makes some of the slower moments in the film feel a bit longer than they should. How the film slowly reveals what’s going on with Oliver is a bit more satisfying.\r\n\r\nThere’s a palpable tension early on where Laura seems like she could either be a gypsy-like character that dabbles in some sort of dark arts or just has a weird infatuation with the dead but cares about the well-being of Andy and Piper. Riding that tension a little bit longer where the film could have felt like it could have gone either way may have had a better payoff. It feels like modern horror films, especially the ones from this year, give a peek behind the curtain too soon and you’re left riding this varying wave of monotony.\r\n\r\nBring Her Back is another mesmerizing effort from the Phillipou brothers with gnarly sequences that teeter on being fully gruesome. Sally Hawkins portrays a nurturing nightmare of a motherly figure to terrifying perfection.",

  "content": "When their father is found dead in the shower, seventeen year old “Andy” (Billy Barrett) wants to look after his blind step-sister “Piper” (Sora Wong) but he’s just too young. Rather than split them up, social services offer to send them both into the care of “Laura” (Sally Hawkins) who has recently lost a daughter of her own. She seems to take to the young girl, but is completely indifferent to her big brother and both siblings are perplexed by the presence of the mute “Oliver” (the scene-stealing Jonah Wren Phillips) who seems to inhabit a world all of his own. As the newcomers try to settle in, it becomes apparent that “Laura” has an agenda that might not synch up with either “Piper” or “Andy” and when she clearly starts to sabotage not just their relationship but also any chance he might have for guardianship, an ulterior motive starts to rear it’s brutally ugly head. This is a completely different type of horror movie from most I’ve seen, and that’s largely down to Hawkins. She exudes a potent combination of trustworthiness and coercive intimidation really quite compellingly. Her character got quite successfully under my finger nails as she played her manipulative game and unusually, I found myself caring about these two youngsters. It’s tensely directed, set amidst a remote farmhouse and plays nicely to assumptions that this woman has been endorsed by the authorities, so therefore she must be kosher for these kids still dealing with the grief of finding their dad on the bathroom floor. It also benefits from concluding in a largely unexpected fashion, and it’s safe to say that the underpinning psychology of this story of bereavement and desperation is quite a compelling watch. After about twenty minutes, try watching it with your eyes closed for a short while - it is quite scary.",

  "content": "After the explosive and inventive horror of TALK TO ME, my anticipation for Danny and Michael Philippou's follow-up was immense. I was prepared for intensity, but nothing quite readies you for BRING HER BACK, a film that perfectly defines the term \"tough watch.\" This is a profoundly discomforting and disturbing experience, featuring some of the most visually shocking and traumatic scenes in recent memory. The true standout is the makeup and prosthetics department, whose gruesome work is so visceral it burrows under your skin, no matter how seasoned a horror viewer you might be. The Philippou brothers once again demonstrate their exceptional storytelling craft, employing a stark \"show, don't tell\" approach that trusts the audience's intelligence to piece together a layered narrative. While the underlying story is more straightforward than their debut, the masterful control of tone and pacing builds an almost unbearable tension, sustained by tremendous performances. Sally Hawkins is predictably brilliant, but it's the young cast — led by Sora Wong and Billy Barratt, and featuring a spectacularly creepy Jonah Wren Phillips — that carries the movie's heavy, dark heart.\r\n\r\nWhere the film elevates itself from mere shock horror to something truly profound is in its brutal thematic exploration. This is a story about how unresolved grief can corrupt and metastasize, twisting a mother's love into a monstrous, obsessive force that perpetuates cycles of abuse. The supernatural elements serve as a dark, powerful allegory for the very real horrors of identity erasure and the vulnerability of foster children, used by adults to fill their own emotional voids. Andy, our voice of reason, anchors the narrative as he fights to protect his blind stepsister, Piper, from the chillingly manipulative Laura, a woman whose unholy grief drives her to commit unspeakable acts. It's a complex, harrowing dynamic that's almost perfectly executed, save for one bold decision regarding a character's fate that feels tacked on for shock value rather than narrative substance. Still, this is a minor issue in an otherwise remarkable work.\r\n\r\nAn unforgettable and essential piece of modern horror, as thematically rich as it is visually terrifying.\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

  "content": "Imagine if your room-mate kept getting recurring nightmares that she was going to find herself impaled on a rusty bit of iron after falling from a collapsed revolving restaurant hundreds of feet in the air? Yep - I’d probably just quietly put a pillow over her head one night, too. Luckily, “Stefani” (Kaitlyn Santa Reyes) gets to go home and try to get to the bottom of things. When she mentions this to her family, it turns out that the dream has it’s roots in fact and that is all comes down to whacky grandma “Iris” (Gabrielle Rose) who lives in a remote location that wouldn’t have looked out of place in a “Mad Max” movie and who has her own theory about just what happened on that very night, fifty years ago, and about death. As with the other “Final Destination” series, death is much more of an animate object with a plan, a scheme and boy does it not like it when a plan doesn’t come together. Pretty swiftly, the young lass concludes that over the intervening years the grim reaper has been settling scores and now it is the turn of her family. They all think she’s bonkers, but when their attitudinal cousin “Erik” (Richard Harmon) finds himself having an exceptionally narrow escape, they begin to sit up and take notice. Thing is, though, do they seriously think they can thwart the original man with the scythe? You know that expression about a moth fluttering it’s wings by the Amazon and there being an tsunami in Sri Lanka? Well some of the deathly cause and effect scenarios here are just as entertainingly far fetched as we learn to appreciate the terrors of some otherwise benign garden implements, a nose-ring and a rusty old weathervane - to name but a few instruments - that can be used to facilitate our always brutal and gory journey to the hereafter. The disasters-in-waiting are all fairly visually teed up for us, so we can anticipate the grizzle before it inevitably occurs - but what we can’t always do is anticipate just how these incidents will pan out. Death may have a plan, but it’s an adaptable one and as the family start to dwindle in typically slasher-horror fashion we are able to pick out favourites (mine was the annoying “Aunt Brenda” (April Talek)) and hope that they might be next! This is enjoyable stuff that needs to be watched in the spirit intended. No, the script isn’t up to much nor are any of the standard acting performances from the Blumhouse book of scream then run before making implausible decisions and ending up - well you know how that usually pans out. Aim low and be prepared to be entertained, and though overlong, this ought to make you giggle and cringe a little.",

  "content": "<em>'Final Destination Bloodlines'</em> is unexpectedly terrific. I watched the original five movies two months ago and highly enjoyed the first flick, though the subsequent follow-ups weren't the best (though I did like <em>'Final Destination 5'</em>). This is the best sequel, no doubt.\r\n\r\nWhat I wanted going in was mindless fun and cool deaths. For me, it ticked both of those boxes with full conviction. I think I gained entertainment from every offing, which is pleasing. They are very nicely done, rather creative too. I'm sure the plot has holes, but honestly... <a href=\"https://youtu.be/RsYi2VH2y6U?si=EYdGbleQqyzUPFt6&t=2\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>\"we don't care\"</i></a>.\r\n\r\nThe cast are all pleasing, there isn't anyone who blew me away or anything but I did really enjoy those onscreen here. Kaitlyn Santa Juana is the standout, but Gabrielle Rose, Richard Harmon and the rest (I see you, Teo Briones of <em>'Chucky'</em>) are all good value. The special effects are satisfying, as well.\r\n\r\nI will state that the film is possibly more funny than I think it intends to be, which isn't a bad thing whatsoever for me but I did sense it wasn't quite intending to be as amusing as it is in parts; even if they are, of course, going for laughs still. Maybe I'm wrong. All's well that ends well, either way.\r\n\r\nI'd rank this higher than the original. There isn't much in it, but this does narrowly outdo that one in my opinion. Kudos to all involved, because this release could've easily went down like a lead balloon (that sounds like a plot for one of these films; I want compo if that's what FD7 turns out to be, New Line Cinema).",

There's also a competently handled dose of sixties nostalgia, that taps into the kinds of fears anyone who has  eaten at a revolving restaurant, perched atop a tall tower, might entertain. Having eaten at two, one in Hong Kong and another in China, myself, this felt familiar and did make me chuckle (nervously).\r\n\r\nWhere I believe, this film falls down, is it could have crafted, cunningly clever kills, without the need to make them gratuitous. I found this aspect of the film, off putting and I probably wont watch another, for this reason. Its cheap, tasteless, sensationalist and frankly, unnecessarily degrades, what otherwise, could have been an eerily entertaining experience.  \r\n\r\nIn summary, a lot to like but the heavy handed, gratuitously cruel, cringe worthy, death scenes, for me, detracted from the enjoyment of this film.",

The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na’vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na’vi learns to be ocean Na’vi and then fight Stephen Lang. But the new movie also focuses on a group of annoying teens that constantly get themselves in trouble and peril over and over again throughout the much too long 3+ hour runtime and sidelining better, more established characters. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original at every turn. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that’s all it is.",

Score (Simon Franglen) remains epic, and the genuine dynamics between the characters of the Sully family lead the viewer to strongly, emotionally invest in them - the performances of the cast, namely Zoe Saldaña, are vital for the film's success.\r\n\r\nToo bad the recycled, generic narrative doesn't keep up with the creativity, dedication, and innovation levels allocated to the technical elements. Underwhelming to the point of making the three-hour runtime feel heavier than it should, but for fans of the original - which remains supreme - it's far from ruining one of the year's must-see theater experiences.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B+",

  "content": "An exciting return to Pandora: the world of Na&#39;vi. One of the best movies, like 2009&#39;s Avatar, to see in 3D! The characters seem to come out of the screen and it seems to witness the events firsthand. The world of Na&#39;vi has changed and is once again in danger. Man is the cause of evil as in reality. We are destroying our planet that used to be our Pandora. Pandora is our home, we are Pandora. The houses of the Na&#39;vi look like the tents of the American Indians, for me this is no coincidence and recalls the genocide of the American Indians. In my opinion it is a good sequel that deals with very relevant themes such as love, family and mourning. The initial water monologue which then returns towards the end is very poetic and universal! Emotional film that in some parts makes you cry. I recommend viewing in 3D for those who have already seen the previous film and were fascinated by that amazing world and the protagonist&#39;s love and life story.",

  "content": "**My rating: 10/10**\r\nWhy? I rate any movie based on a few things. Warning! Potential Spoilers.\r\n\r\n**1. Story**. Is the story compelling, does it stick in your mind after the movie, haunting you like a ghost, forcing you to think about it and even your own life? Does it have any positive messages aka moral of the story.\r\n\r\nThe story of The Way of Water is indeed compelling. The Conflict is multifaceted. Family conflict, Human-Na'vi conflict, Tribal Conflict and most importantly, personal conflict, aka identity conflict. The identity conflict is mostly fuelled by outcast feeling. There are a lot of people including Jake who at some point feel like they don't belong. I believe most people feel this way at some point in life, you don’t need to be in the protected minority groups for you to feel like an outcast. And while we may not be accepted for who we are, defining who are begins with ourselves first. Our world is full of people who want to be identified in one way or another. But have they identified themselves first? Just remember, most people feel discriminated for one reason or another in life. Religion, gender, skin colour, country, body size or smartness in school, political affiliation. Nobody gets love all round all times. Know who you are and don’t fuss to much about it. Learn a losson from Spider (Miles Socorro).\r\n\r\n**2. Characters**. Are there likeable characters you can get attached to? Characters you remember later, characters that inspire. Characters that grow.\r\nSpidey is a new character, and he has a great story to tell. Jake has changed a lot too and for good reason. People undergo a lot of transformation in life. You can’t be what Don Williams calls a Rake and Ramblin’ Man your entire life. I read an article review complaining how Jake tucked his tail and ran. That review completely missed the point. Jakes decision may not have been the right one, but put in his situation, it is a decision that a lot of people would make. \r\n\r\n**3. Acting**. Is the acting good? Is it realistic enough to be believable to a point you forget the people are just acting? I was more than impressed by Neytiri’s “gone nuts” scene. I felt her pain, and in that instance, I was nuts too. I honestly forgot this was just a movie. Actors can make you cry, and that is just how it should be. You forget that it is just an act, no need to cry. I also read an article that complained about the dialogue of the teenagers. I don’t know what the reviewer expected. Philosophy from teens? Their conversation is believable enough for their age.\r\n\r\n**4. Everything tied together**. A good story told by good and believable characters needs a setup. Something to tie them together into a bundle.  Avatar ties everything together with wonderful visuals. I don’t need to say more.",

The emotion in the film feels forced and the story is like swapping a blue thread for a green one as it threads the same, withered fabric from 2009. This is a special effects extravaganza with nauseating results that only partially impresses and mostly succumbs to being its own biggest fanatic.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://boundingintocomics.com/2022/12/19/avatar-the-way-of-water-review-mo-navi-mo-problems/",

  "content": "Well we ought not to have expected \"Jake\" (Sam Worthington) and \"Neytiri\" (Zoe Saldana) to have let the grass grow during the intervening years since we were first introduced to the idyllic world of \"Pandora\". Now with four children and their human friend \"Spider\" (Jack Champion - remember Johnny Sheffield?), they are living life to the full. Until, that is, one night they see a new star in the sky. Star? Well, no - it's the ships announcing the return of the human beings, this time even more bent on the conquest of their planet now that the Earth is finally on it's knees. Armed to the hilt with the latest technology and weaponry, and commanded by the essence of the departed \"Col. Quaritch\" - who also now leads a squad of Na'vi-esque avatars of his own - things look ominous for the \"Sully\" family. Realising that they are front and centre for their persecutors, they relocate to (saddle themselves on) a remote, water-based community where they hope, rather unrealistically, to be able to sit it out... This is undoubtedly a beautiful piece of cinema to watch. 3D and IMAX with a classily crafted score from Simon Franglen and a message that trumpets the cruciality of the symbiotic relationships between all creatures that live on a world where co-operation and understanding are vital to the survival of all. Thing is, though, that all of that glorious cinematography starts to get just a bit repetitive after about an hour and the middle portion of this really does drag. Indeed, were this to have been a long \"Blue Planet\" style documentary alerting us to the dangers of mankind's rampant abuse of resources with scant regard to the implications for any other species, then I would have enjoyed it better in three parts with Sir David Attenborough's mellifluous narration. It isn't though, and the story is stretched so terribly thinly that - sorry, sacrilege I know - I was actually bored a bit. It does pick up for the last forty minutes or so as the denouement provides for loads of action-packed pyrotechnics but to be honest, I had sort of lost interest by that point. Certainly, it is a great looking film that offers us food for thought, but as a story - I thought it weak, predictable and at times it does just a little too much of it's own recycling. Indeed - had their children actually done what they were told in the first place, there might not have been much of a story at all! Essential on a big screen.",

  "content": "Avatar: The Way of Water is a visual spectacle from start to finish. The scenery, cinematography, and CGI constantly had a smile on my face, but is it enough to carry the film?\r\n\r\nWhile the previous entry had its fair share of story-related problems, the sequel corrects most of my issues and delivers a heartfelt family story. The main improvement from the first entry is character development. I had a genuine emotional connection with the Sully family and was invested in their safety. These feelings created some genuine tension when any of the family members were in danger, I felt my body tense up as I waited to see what the conflict's conclusion would be, which is a gigantic improvement from the first film where I could not care less who died or survived.\r\n\r\nThe return of Stephan Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch brought the overly campy villain back to the screen in a bad way. Quaritch is a caricature of a \"villain\" where his actions and attitude are evil for the sake of being the bad guy. His anger toward Jake Sully does seem a little bit more believable hear as his previous self was murdered by him, but the over-the-top theatrics are just too much for me.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of the story that did not feel right to me was the children constantly disobeying their parents for the sake of plot progression. Countless times, Jake Sully's kids would do the opposite of what they were told, leaving them in a vulnerable state to be captured. This danger forced Jake Sully to constantly expose himself and help draw the threat ever closer to his family. The moments that result are great as we get to see the dichotomy between Jake being a father and his militaristic background. This is at the heart of the story and worked for me.\r\n\r\nI was surprised to see how well-paced the film was despite its over three-hour runtime. There are some pretty slow parts, specifically the second act, but the visuals and the character journeys that happen during these parts are so interesting that they didn't impact me negatively; I was just happy to see new and beautiful aspects of Pandora.\r\n\r\nThe performances were fantastic throughout. It is a testament to both the actors/actresses and also the technology that can display such complex emotions and visual nuances on entirely CGI creatures. Sigourney Weaver was a highlight with Kiri, who was at the forefront of the entire film. To be completely honest, I did not even know she was played by Weaver; the mix between her performance and voice modulation created a compelling 14-year-old girl that was a huge part of the story. Sam Worthington was incredible and Zoe Saldana was perfect. Saldana does so much acting with her facial expressions as Ney'tirl, which is on display during many emotional scenes her character goes through. She was a bit sidelined during this film, but when she was on screen, she was impactful.\r\n\r\nAvatar has some incredibly heavy themes at play. One of the strongest and most relevant messages was anti-poaching. I mention this because there was such a hard scene in this movie that had me on the verge of tears. It was something I'd never seen in the film; it was both beautiful in the brutality it displayed and the emotional response of the Na'vi.\r\n\r\nOverall, this movie is deserving of the hype and needs to be seen on the biggest screen available. James Cameron delivered on the 13 years build-up to the sequel and has gotten me excited for the three sequels planned for the next decade.\r\n\r\nScore: 88%\r\nVerdict: Excellent",

Unsurprisingly, characterisations fare little better, being of the decidedly card board cut out, variety. Fight scenes, which populate much of this flick, feel like something thrown together, by a well funded group of fantasy larpers. \r\n\r\nOddly enough, a portion of the acting is actually quite worthwhile, especially the villain of the piece played by the talented Robert Sheehan but really, that's about it. \r\n\r\nIn summary, a basic sword and sorcery tale,that's mildly watchable but lacking in many respects. I personally feel the film from 1985, is vastly superior. Take a look at both and see if you don't agree with me.",

  "content": "**A long format review from 2012**\r\n\r\nMy new favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe film, undoubtedly! Order goes thusly;\r\n\r\n1. The Avengers\r\n2. Iron Man\r\n3. Thor\r\n4. Captain America\r\n5. Iron Man 2\r\n6. The Incredible Hulk\r\n\r\nI had the privilege of going to Sydney and watching this almost a full three weeks before it’s American release, in a special advance screening for fans and a handful of critics. I drove up and back on a day trip with my mate HRV, spent over $400 between us… So worth it.\r\n\r\nI think perhaps my expectations of The Avengers were too high. In fact I know they were, even so, I feel that it almost managed to meet them. All but two of the fears I had about this epic were quashed without a doubt. I initially was worried about Mark Ruffalo helming the role of The Hulk/Bruce Banner after taking over from Edward Norton who was ousted after his first appearance. My complaints were completely unfounded however, as Mark Ruffalo presents us with an at least as good Marvel Hero. \r\n\r\nIn terms of entertainment, The Avengers is one of the greatest feats ever produced. At the screening I went to, I actually missed more than a couple of lines due to the fact that the entire bloody cinema was in hysterics from some classic Joss Whedon (Director - Buffy, Angel, Firefly, Dollhouse) humour. The squabbles between these larger than life characters are not quite up to the peak that Jon Favreau’s Iron Man & Iron Man 2 sit on, but in terms of film in general, they are some of the better interactions I’ve ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe only weak points I really have to whinge about are both quite minor, and perhaps can be rectified in the MCU future. Firstly, Thor’s return to Earth (whilst brilliantly dramatic and pretty) was quite weak in terms of exposition. That said, this isn’t a Thor movie, so we don’t need to know everything that happens to him. Also, in next year’s Thor 2, it is very possible we’ll discover more specific details about the first few scenes of his return. Secondly, Loki’s army also came across to me quite weakly. In case we have any Marvel aficionados in the crowd, I won’t spoil it by telling you who they’re supposed to be, but in general the whole army was essentially a meat shield used to bump out scenes in which The Avengers get to kick ass. A very enjoyable part of the film, but one that doesn’t really drive the story at all.\r\n\r\nI feel the only way I can adequately describe just how much you need to see this movie (in cinemas) is this: For those of you who understand me, you will be know and be aware of just how much I fucking hate the concept of Blu-Ray. I am going to buy a Blu-Ray player, a HD television, and Blu-Ray discs, just so that I will get more special features when The Avengers is released. Never have I even considered doing such a thing before.\r\n\r\nThe Avengers doesn’t get into your mind and rape it in the best way possible like Revolver or Donnie Darko. It doesn’t get into your guts and turn them with nostalgic violence like the brilliance in Doomsday or Outpost. It gets into your heart, and leaves you not just wanting, but needing more. Long live the MCU!\r\n\r\n90%\r\n\r\n-Gimly",

Sure there is a little bickering in between them but not too much to distract from the fun.\r\n\r\nI’ve always liked Robert Downey Jr’s portrayal of Tony Stark and his sharp tongue. I did wonder how they where going to get the Hulk in there since he’s supposed to be uncontrollable but they did it. Okay they downplayed his uncontrollability a bit but I can live with that. I absolutely loved the “puny god” scene (if you haven’t seen the film yet you’ll have to see it to know what I mean, I wont spoil it in advance).\r\n\r\nI have to say that I found Thor himself a bit underwhelming again though. I just expect something more imposing as the good of thunder. But then I’m Scandinavian so…\r\n\r\nAnyway, this was a great film. I enjoyed it very much.",

Music is scored by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Seamus McGarvey.\r\n\r\nAsgardian outcast Loki (Hiddlestone) has struck a deal with the Chitauri to exchange the Tesseract for an army with which he can attack Earth and thus control it. With the Earth in mortal danger, S.H.I.E.L.D director Nick Fury (Jackson) activates the Avengers Initiative; a collection of super heroes and deadly assassins who, if they can actually come together as one united force, hold the fate of the Earth in their hands.\r\n\r\nI have no real frame of reference with The Avengers comic book world, when I was young I read a bit of Spidey, Batman and was kind of partial to The Fantastic Four, but I really don't remember story lines and gave up reading that sort of stuff once sport and exams came into my life. I love movies and as I enter the later stages of my forties I'm pleased to say I have a wide range of film genre interests. I have very much enjoyed The Avengers solo films so far, with the exception of Iron Man 2 which quite frankly is average at best, but the reality is that if The Avengers failed as a movie, that Whedon got it so wrong, then I wouldn't be foaming at the mouth or proclaiming that the director be stripped naked and whipped around the streets of Hollywood! As it is, with one or two minor irks aside, The Avengers is about as much fun as I have had with a movie in quite a few years.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't know if the makers got the essence right, or if the story is at one in the Marvel Avengers Universe, I just know that it is a right old blast and made a colossal amount of money at the box office, even trumping The Dark Knight Rises in that department. It's a film full of derring-do heroics, ripe witticisms, wonderfully staged action, simmering sexual tensions, ego collisions, charm, heart and splendid human interactions. It looks fabulous on Blu-ray, the art design, the colour photography and Silvestri's score rumbles like thunder and crackles like lightning, just as a super hero movie score should do. The cast performances are hugely enjoyable as they bounce off of one and other, feeding off the respective thespian energy with a knowing of the right tone to make this colourful comic book world be all that it can be. While Whedon, with a weight of expectation akin to Atlas holding the World on his shoulders, comes through with flying colours with astute pacing and an impressive marshaling of an acting army.\r\n\r\nFlaws? Jackson's Nick Fury could have done with more screen time and Cobie Smulders is sadly short changed as well. The Chitauri are only really a threat because of their sheer numbers, not because of any great alien design, and, well, The Hulk CGI hasn't really advanced much from the 2008 version, but really these are small itches rather than big ones. Is The Avengers the best film of 2012? It will be seen as such for many fans of the source(s) who have waited with baited breath for this coming together of their heroes, and that notion really shouldn't irk the more highbrow film fans out there. Me? No it isn't the best film of 2012, but as I found my self perched on the edge of my seat as the finale unfurls in a wave of explosive heroic energy, and I caressed my ribs from laughing out loud, I knew then that undoubtedly The Avengers is the most fun film of 2012. 9/10",

Pretty swiftly, thanks to the intervention of the newly mobile tech gazillionaire “Alt” (Jermaine Clement), she finds herself working on something she’d vowed never to touch again, else niece “Cady” (Violet McGraw) is gonna be toast. Luckily, she can count on the help of the benevolent “Christian” (Aristotle Athari) and a supply of kit that could build a space shuttle from scratch. Of course we, watching, all know this is bound to be but a cunning ploy by the demonic robot to reincarnate and cause havoc, and so down the predictably latex brick road we go. Now it’s not actually that much worse than the first film. There are some pithy lines contained amidst the endless dialogue and there are even a few laughs to be had as the acrobatics see furniture trashed and limbs torn asunder with the reliability of a “John Wick” film. The acting is all pretty feeble but I did quite enjoy the messy savagery of the denouement even if it is very nearly smothered in a syrupy gloop of disappointing sentiment and by the time it was all over, I was surprised that I didn’t hate it.

  "content": "I’m sure I remember reading that the first of this trio of films (2019) was going to be a one-off? Well obviously it wasn’t and despite a fairly thin plot here, it is quite hard to believe that the “Crawley” clan and their staff are really going to be hanging up their hats here, either. This time, it’s the American cousins who are due to visit them all with, they hope, some good news on the inheritance front following the death of the mother of the Countess (Elizabeth McGovern). It also transpires that “Lady Mary” (Michelle Dockery) is at the centre of a scandal that could well have lasting repercussions for her role as the new mistress of the Abbey. On that front, the Earl (Hugh Bonneville) is struggling to let go of the reins and with “Carson” (Jim Carter) and “Mrs. Hughes” (Phyllis Logan) retired; “Mrs. Patmore” (Lesley Nicol) about to hand over the kitchen to a “Daisy” (Sophie McShera) who’s now married to the newly promoted butler “Parker” (Michael Fox) it’s all change at this grand stately home. They might be able to rescue their socially volatile situation if they can convince none other than raconteur Noël Coward (Arty Froushan) to come visit with their acting pal “Dexter” (Dominic West) - remember he took “Barrow” (Robert James-Collier) to be his “dresser” last time. With all of this happening, brother “Levinson” (Paul Giamatti) arrives with his dashing financial advisor “Sambrook” (Alessandro Nivola) to reveal to “Cora” that there is quite a fly in the ointment and that irreversible change is looming for everyone. If this were a soap, this film would advance the plot only slightly from the last film. We have moved into the 1930s with fashions, music and attitudes beginning to change and though character progress is inevitable, the film misses the sparring between the now “Lady Merton” (Dame Penelope Wilton) and Dame Maggie Smith (to whom the film is dedicated). There is an attempt to recreate that, of sorts, with the curmudgeonly snob “Sir Hector” (Sir Simon Russell Beale at his most entertainingly pompous) and the whole production is classy, stylish and shows clearly that the spirit of Merchant Ivory high British costume drama is not only alive and well, but thriving too. Democracy and end of empire are coming to “Downton”, but let’s hope not too swiftly - else the late dowager will be spinning in her grave and the upstairs/downstairs mystique that made this work will evaporate into something altogether too egalitarian.",

That’s almost entirely down to a cheeky and engaging effort from Ben Wang as the young “Li Fong” who has recently (and reluctantly) arrived in Los Angeles from Beijing with his doctor mother (Ming-Na Wen) after a family tragedy which we go into a little more, later. He befriends pizza family “Victor” (Joshua Jackson) and his teenage daughter “Mia” (Sadie Stanley) but quickly - and quite brutally - discovers that former prize-fighting dad is in hock to a loan shark and so wants to try to punch his way out of his problems. When he realises that the young lad has some skill with kung-fu, they decide to team up and that’s the start of their escapades that ultimately pitches the new arrival against local champion “Conor” (Aramis Knight). For that challenge, he is lucky to have the help of his visiting Chinese mentor “Shifu” (Jackie Chan) who manages to elicit the assistance of the original “Karate Kid” himself (Ralph Macchio) so he may practise the more cerebral “Miyagi” form of karate. Predictable? Well, yes and Macchio is about as wooden as one of his late, lamented, master’s bonsai trees but there’s a little gentle mischief from Chan and just about enough action to stop the melodrama from swamping the thing. You will probably never recall it half an hour after you’ve seen it, but it’s is probably second to the original (1984) and passes a couple of hours effortlessly.",

  "content": "Where do you start with Tron: Legacy? It’s a sequel to a minor cult hit that arrived in theaters 28 years ago, a film more renown for its (at the time) state-of-the-art design than its coherent story or classic characters, rekindled now not as a reboot or remake, but as a direct sequel to that long-ago work.\r\n\r\nTron's esteem may have grown in the intervening years (much the same fate as another maligned-at-the-time science fiction film, Blade Runner), but time has been mostly unkind to it; Disney attempted to stage a run of pre-LEGACY screenings of the original film, but modern audiences greeted its dated appeal as unintentionally hilarious. Frightened by the impact this might have had on their $170 million spectacle, they pulled plans for a theatrical release, and whisked the recent 25th anniversary DVD off of store shelves. And so, bereft of a childhood that contained Tron, I went into the sequel with naught but a Wikipedia plot breakdown (which was, to be honest, frustratingly informative) to fill in what turned out to be largely irrelevant narrative gaps. I say that to say that I am reviewing Legacy solely for Legacy's sake, untainted by nostalgia or high expectations.\r\n\r\nMore than two decades after the events of the first film (which, for the uninitiated, involve a computer programmer [Jeff Bridges, reprising his role] being zapped from the physical world into the computer world he created and fighting an oppressive digital tyrant within), we’re introduced to that computer programmer’s twenty-something kid, heir to his father’s tech empire and not terribly happy about it. It seems he’s still hung up on his father’s mysterious disappearance long ago, and a mysterious message leads to him discovering Dear Old Dad’s secret underground lab, where he’s accidentally zapped into the digital world as well. I’m afraid I’m not spoiling anything to go ahead and say that within he finds his trapped father, and they must fight their way back out. To give more plot details would be unfair and pointless. Suffice to say that once within the digital realm, it becomes action beat after action beat wherein our young hero rescues dad and his requisite romantic interest until the film ends.\r\n\r\nOh sure, there are good guys, and there are bad guys, and there’s a token stab at depth, but what does it matter? That digital world looks really cool, right? And that’s why we go. The sad truth of the matter, however, is that what looks awesome in a two-minute trailer begins to wear on the eyes when presented long-form. “The Grid” exists in three colors: neon blue, neon orange, and black. Well, two colors and an absence of color, I suppose. As nifty as this may seem, two-plus hours of this (particularly at the reduced light offered by 3D projection) robs it of interest, and the whole thing becomes a dull slog. 3D works by enhancing depth, but little to no depth is present when the film is lit and shot in such a stylized manner. To boot, only the bad guys are orange. And as our audience proxy characters are good, we’re robbed even of the contrasting orange to break up the monotony.\r\n\r\nThere are some neat sequences, of course: the initial lightcycle battle, a digital dogfight later on, etc. Garret Hedlund and Oliva Wilde are perfectly fine in their frankly bland roles, and Jeff Bridges squeezes what depth he can into his dual characters (actual Kevin Flynn and his twenty-years-younger digital duplicate, thanks to some unnerving but nifty visual trickery). The film is far from the unwatchable dreck of, say, The Chronicles of Narnia: Voyage of the Dawn Treader. It’s just...not very interesting. Techno group Daft Punk’s score was easily the best part of the film, and something I’d actually recommend picking up with no hesitations. At its best, the Daft Punk score and stylized imagery (early in the film, before it wears you down) do provide a unique and imaginative experience. It’s just one fit for the length of a music video, not a feature film.\r\n\r\nBut let’s not kid ourselves: Tron: Legacy is a flashy, ridiculous spectacle that exists solely to put pretty pictures onscreen for two hours and drive a $4+ 3D surcharge. And I say that with no judgment. Some films simply are what they are, and you’ve no more right to expect a dog to meow than to glean from them deep meditations on the human condition. The history of cinema is full of this kind of shallow but aloofly entertaining distraction. But is it wrong to want more of these kinds of films? Take Star Wars, for instance: its strength lies mainly in its revolutionary aesthetic and special effects, but it’s the characters that we remember from the film, not just how cool some set-piece looked. And Lucas isn’t even a terribly good writer; the strength of his characters came from that universal pull all great archetypes have, that ability for audience identification and empathy. Will the name Sam Flynn have the same kind of longevity? What about...uh, Oliva Wilde’s character? Apparently not, at least for me. (Note: IMDb says it’s “Quorra.”) If nostalgia for the first film is strong for you, or you’ve no qualms about paying $14+ for a mildly-distracting if uninvolving experience, go for it. Everyone else may as well save themselves the money. Maybe catch it on Blu-ray.\r\n\r\nI should note, though, that I can honestly say 3D added nothing to the experience, so if you want to be able to actually see in The Grid, save yourself the money and hop into a 2D seat.",

I actually formed a connection with the characters in this one, which is the complete opposite to the original. The special effects (bar the de-aging) are a vast improvement, which is to be expected in fairness; I love the look of this.\r\n\r\nIt's nice to get a proper view into the 'outside' lives of the protagonists, rather than receiving a tiny backstory before shoving them into the new universe; I appreciated the build-up to the eventual entry. The score is also terrific, even if it's strange hearing Daft Punk's \"Outlands\" due to my familiarity of it coming from Sky Sports UK's Formula 1 opening credits.\r\n\r\nGarrett Hedlund is great in the role Sam, I enjoyed his performance from the get-go. Jeff Bridges is excellent too, I feel all the actors in general were given much more to work with in this one; I barely took notice of Bridges (& Co.) in the predecessor, but he stands out big here. Olivia Wilde and Michael Sheen are good, also. Cillian Murphy even makes a minute appearance.\r\n\r\nIt does, at least to me, feel like a very different film when compared to <em>'Tron'</em>, which may disappoint lovers of the latter but will be relief to opposing folk; e.g. me.\r\n\r\nWasn't sure what to expect from this, but thankfully it produces an entertaining time.",

  "content": "**Overall : Kosinski upgrades TRON in every way for a new generation with this stunning sci-fi adventure.**\r\n\r\nBelieve it or not, Top Gun was not the first franchise Joseph Kosinski revives with a legacy sequel over 30 years after the original. And just like Top Gun: Maverick, Kosinski did a masterful job bringing a series back to life. TRON: Legacy improved on its predecessor in every way. I remember seeing it in 3D IMAX and being completely blown away at the effects (although the de-aging effects are pretty dated but were impressive at the time), the soundtrack, the story, and the acting. Kosinski connected the past with the modern age by bringing back Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner while providing a story that engages and intrigues a new generation. I can't say I was a major fan of the original, but I loved this movie. This sci-fi adventure felt like the beginning of something incredible, but sadly Disney acquired Marvel shortly after the release of TRON: Legacy and shifted their focus to the MCU. Hopefully, after Kosinski's success with Top Gun: Maverick, the chances of a TRON 3 will be reignited because I am ready for more!",

I have already written about it and I stand by what I said: it is a film that I understand, that came in the wake of a popular fever around everything electronic, but that was made before its time, with visual and special effects that, today, seem as archaic as a 1990s cell phone. I don't know if this movie should be a sequel or if it should have been made a remake instead, but there's no doubt about the superiority of this movie: not only does it feature visual effects and CGI of great beauty and quality, as it has a frankly better script (which does not mean perfection).\r\n\r\nIndeed, the script is satisfactory, presenting an unlikely story, where a very rich young man decides to sabotage his own company thinking he is doing what his father, who disappeared for years, would approve. After that, he receives a message from his father, and the clue leads him to an old arcade, long closed, and to his father's old computer. It is there that the young man is sucked into a cybernetic space, controlled by a vile and dictatorial program. Yes, humans sucked, physically speaking, into computers. As if social media weren't enough! Added to this, the worn-out clichés of the relationship between an absent father and a needy son, an essay on a loving sub-plot without any logic, a cartoon villain without personality and made to hate.\r\n\r\nJeff Bridges returns to the character he played in the first film, both in the person of the actor we know, and in the figure of a young alter-ego, created digitally. The actor is good, and we already know his merits, but the truth is that he doesn't seem to be in great shape. He accompanies the film, following the action, but he is not particularly noticeable in this work, as he was not in the initial film. Garrett Hedlund has a little more visibility and is, in fact, the protagonist here, but he doesn't do much more than be an action figure.\r\n\r\nIt is in the technical aspects that the film stands out and deserves some praise, particularly thanks to the extraordinary design of the visual effects and the CGI, which are among the most elegant and well-executed we have seen. Recreating the concepts of the original film, they show a cleaner and more finished look, without obvious gimmicks that are unbelievable to the eyes, and with much better worked colors. However, a film is not made of style and extraordinary visuals, and there are many recent examples of visually amazing films that are worthless because they do not have quality stories. Also noteworthy are the sets and costumes, as well as the electronic soundtrack, by the French dJ duo Daft Punk.",

Darren Aronofsky once again demonstrates that he's a master of creating experiences that don't digest easily and continue to echo long after the credits roll.\r\n\r\nAustin Butler delivers an unforgettable performance, charged with magnetism and intensity, capable of elevating every scene to a rare level of authenticity. While some narrative choices are less satisfying, they don't diminish the value of a film that remains an emotionally devastating, compelling journey into the heart of a man torn apart by life.\r\n\r\nIt's an imperfect but powerful story, one that deserves to be seen and discussed with the same passion Aronofsky pours into every project.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B+",

  "content": "When filmmakers seek to stretch their creative juices by working on projects that aren’t typical of their normal output, they need to get their ducks in a row first if they hope to succeed in these new ventures. In tackling such productions, some have brilliantly broadened their ranges, while others have regrettably failed miserably. Rarely, however, do they fall somewhere in the middle, but such is the case with director Darren Aronofsky’s latest, a comedy/crime thriller that gets some things right and others not so much. Set in 1998, the picture follows the story of a once-promising baseball prospect, Hank Thompson (Austin Butler), whose chances of going pro were ruined by a severe knee injury, forcing him to settle for a routine job as a New York City bartender. It may not be everything he hoped for, but it pays the bills and provides him with a steady supply of his other passion, alcohol. However, his relatively mundane life takes a bizarre left turn one night when his shady, punked-out neighbor, Russ (Matt Smith), asks him to babysit his cat when a family emergency calls him home to London. It’s a favor that unwittingly draws Hank into the underbelly of his neighbor’s sordid, crime-ridden life. And, before he knows it, Hank is unexpectedly caught up in a web of theft, murder, mayhem and crooked cops, leaving him surrounded by an array of corpses and impending threats, with all implications pointing toward him as the perpetrator. He’s thus forced to take desperate measures to stay alive and ahead of the law, all the while struggling to protect his feline companion. The premise here is an intriguing one that gets progressively better as the film unfolds. However, it’s somewhat slow to start and features a profoundly dark narrative in the opening act, leaving one to wonder where the alleged comedy of this offering lurks. As the picture progresses, though, the promised (and often-inspired) humor gradually emerges, providing the much-needed comic relief called for to offset the story’s more sinister and decidedly edgier aspects. This welcome development genuinely helps to save the film from itself, a change in tone that’s significantly enhanced by a coterie of colorful supporting characters superbly portrayed by an excellent ensemble featuring the likes of Regina King, Liev Schreiber, Vincent D’Onofrio, Griffin Dunne, Carol Kane, George Abud, and, of course, Tonic the cat. The film also offers up a fine re-creation of life in 1990s New York down to the finest of details. When these elements are considered collectively, it’s easy to see how the director’s efforts at expanding his vision hit the mark on some points and not on others. In that regard, this offering shows the filmmaker’s promise for tackling projects beyond his typical fare, but a few more ducks need to fall into line before he can truly claim success when embarking on ventures into new territory.",

  "content": "When “Russ” (Matt Smith) asks his bartending, hard-living, pal “Hank” (Austin Butler) to mind his cat whilst he returns to London to look after his sickening dad, he’s narked but agrees. Little does he realise that “Russ” has been involved with some ne’er-do-wells in the city and so fairly swiftly “Hank” is having to develop an whole new pain threshold as first the Russians, then the Hebrews lay into him. The cops are soon involved and his paramedic girlfriend “Yvonne” (Zoë Kravitz) has to find new ways of stitching a wound - and all for what? “Hank” hasn’t a clue who they are, what they want, or where what they want might actually be? It’s only when the spikey-haired British geezer makes a reappearance that things might start to make some sense - but I wouldn’t bet on it! Now despite the fact that Butler is almost always being beaten up - often clad only in his Calvins - he manages to exude loads of charisma into this daft crime caper. Certainly, it plays fast and loose with medical science and serendipity does intervene once or twice more often than you could realistically expect, but it’s a solid action-adventure feature that is bloody, violent but still darkly entertaining. The scene-stealing Hasidic Hebrews (Liev Schreiber and Vincent D’Onofrio) won’t drive on the sabbath, but gun-toting? Well that appears to be allowed? There’s a manic enforcer who has traits reminiscent of an angry chimpanzee and there’s duplicity at every turn before a denouement that is fairly predictable, but nonetheless enjoyable to savour as the calamities accumulate and the initially gullible “Hank” discovers he and “John Wick” must be distant relatives. There’s a cat, and a bandage - but an American Humane Society disclaimer at the end, so clearly it can act too. It is a bit derivative but it doesn’t hang around and it shows us clearly than Butler isn’t just a pretty face.",

  "content": "**A beautiful film with a handful of odd choices.**\r\n\r\nI was hesitant going into this film. On one hand, it was a mainstream zombie film with a big budget and a competent crew. But on the other hand, it was in a franchise I have never loved, and it was the start of a new trilogy. So, while I was confident that it would be a solid movie, I did not know if it would work for me personally or if it would feel like it could stand on its own. I walked out of the theater satisfied with the film. And in the day since, I have grown even more positive on it and am giving it a **9 out of 10**. I think the part that will surprise people the most is the emotional weight that the film carries. And it all comes from the great set of characters and their relationships. There is a lot of heart and even some great humor to get you invested. This elevates the film above being just another fun zombie movie. But let's talk about the zombies/infected. There are a couple new ideas introduced with them in this that I really dig. They are more monstrous than ever, but they are also showing more humanity than ever. The action and kills are a lot of fun. Everything is as fast and terrifying as usual with this franchise. So, the action is mostly fantastic. I say 'mostly' because there are a couple of editing choices that I think distract from the action more than they enhance it. I can say the same for a handful of other points in the film. They chose to insert flashes of other footage at times. One of the times I loved it. One of the times it was weird and actually felt like a trailer for the movie. And another time, it was just very confusing. (I still don't know the meaning of it) Those are a couple of the times where the style didn't fully work. But for 95% of the film, it does! This film has a look that is so unique. **It feels both calm and like a nightmare at the same time!** I don't know how they did it. If you have seen the awesome trailer, you get a feel for the style of the film. It does not disappoint. Then, there is a scene at the end that sets up the future of the trilogy. This scene has a style and a tone that is like nothing else in the movie. Truly a WTF moment for the audience. It was bold, and it did not work for me. But since it was just a tease to the future films and not integral to this one, I am willing to forgive it. Because before that, we got an actual ending to the film that was emotionally satisfying. This film has no problem standing on its own. Sure, you are left with more to explore, and certain character arcs are left unfinished. But go in knowing it is a trilogy (and that the next one is coming as soon as this January), and these things hopefully won't bother you. - All in all, **I'm a happy zombie fan! :D**",

  "content": "***SPOILERS/STORY SUMMARY REVIEW***\r\n\r\nWhat I will say about this movie is it's not all bad. This first half was really good, with an opening that was reminiscent of 28 Weeks Later. Afterwards though, it cuts to completely different characters for basically the rest of the film. Which would be fine and all, just showing a snippet of how the infection was 28 years before the start of the movie, but it does a weird call back in the ending scene that feels extremely out of place compared to the rest of the film. Aside from that, the first half is really good and the tension of survival of a father and son feels heavy and suspenseful, especially with the addition of a new type of infected: the alpha. This new infected is basically a 'roided up super infected that is both smarter and stronger than normal ones. It's only after making it back to the safe village does the movie noticeably change mood to a more coming of age feeling movie, oddly reminding me a bit of Stand By Me.\r\n\r\nIt's at this point, my enjoyment of this movie kinda began to fall. This latter half just ends up with the boy and his mom going out to find a doctor. The whole trip, it kinda feels like things just happen. And sure, the second half is about accepting death, but it feels so paved over when the boy has a more violent reaction to his dad cheating than the guy who actually kills. It feels so jarring when that scene happens cause it doesn't really fit how the character acted beforehand. \r\n\r\nAfter all is said and done, boy stays outside of the safe village and wanders where it ends in a bizarre scene of him running into a pack of survivors which one turns out to be the kid from the opening scene. It's so weird cause it a group of 5 who at first I mistook as a gang of grannies doing par-core and brutalizing some runner infected all while some trash metal was playing in the background. I did get a laugh at the fact that I wasn't the only one in the theater wondering what the hell was going on when that scene started.\r\n\r\nTLDR: Movie is good and really suspenseful up until they return to base in witch it turns more into a bad attempt of a coming of age story that finishes off with a power rangers type end scene. This whole movie reminds me of what happened with Longlegs. Advertising made the movie seem like a much different movie vs the actual viewing experience. Don't know how the next to films are gonna be like (if they even release), but seeing how much this first film feels like a filler movie doesn't give me much hope that they'll be good....",

  "content": "It’s almost thirty years since Cillian Murphy wandered around in his hospital gown; the so-called “rage” virus still shows no sign of abating and with Britain effectively quarantined from Europe there are few outposts untouched by it’s madness. Protected by the tides, the small island of Lindisfarne is one such bastion and that’s where “Spike” (Alfie Williams) lives with his dad (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and his poorly mum (Jodie Comer). It’s a big day in the place when “Spike” is taken to the mainland by his father to make his first kill. That’s not least because he is barely twelve years old and because he has never seen anything of town nor land as far as the eye can see before. He’s also never seen any of the infected before, either. With this trip being fairly fraught and eventful and with one of his family friends at home telling him of a doctor “Kelson” (Ralph Fiennes) who might be able to help his increasingly disturbed mother, the newly emboldened “Spike” comes up with a daring plan to see if he can help make her better. It’s all pretty standard zombie fayre this film but though there is quite a decent effort from the confident young Williams and Comer does lethally equipped confused well too, the rest of it just lacks much for originality. There’s plenty of action, but there was that in “Shaun of the Dead” (2004) too - and at least that was funny. This is just all a bit intense, with the psycho-babble “up and down again” commentary and some inconsistently incorporated archive from old Robin Hood or Olivier films that seem to suggest something of the recurring nature of history, but also of this plot. Sure, it’s only part one of a trilogy and the iodine-bedecked Fiennes does introduce a little quirky intrigue for what might come next, but I was really quite disappointed with this over-hyped and all too often quite episodic horror, sorry.",

It's a whole lot of adults doing stupid !@#$.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing I dislike more in a movie than supposed competent adult characters doing legitimately stupid !@#$.\r\n\r\nDad is stupid.\r\n\r\nGrandpa, or whoever he is, is stupid.\r\n\r\nMom is fine.\r\n\r\nSoldier boys are stupid.\r\n\r\nVillagers are stupid.\r\n\r\nRage beasts are rage beasts, so they get a pass.\r\n\r\nThe boy is stupid, but I blame the father for that.\r\n\r\nAfter that hour and fourteen minute point that I mentioned, the movie focuses on the mom, the boy, and the doctor, and this is where the movie shines.\r\n\r\nBut then it's back to stupid.\r\n\r\n\"Samson\" has a really big d- <CACKLES> Is that thing real? How big does it get when... \"Samson's\" big d*** is probably the best part of the movie! I digress!\r\n\r\nThe last time we see the doctor, he's being stupid.\r\n\r\nThen we meet the \"Howzats\"!\r\n\r\nThe \"Howzats\" are all kinds of stupid, but they're stupid in the fun way. They're the only fun stupid in the movie.\r\n\r\nThere are two good bits in this movie - one is somewhere in the middle and the other is at the end, and that's the only reason it gets a 6/10. Hey! I made a rhyme!\r\n\r\nAlso, yes! I have seen \"28 Days Later\" and \"28 Weeks Later\".\r\n\r\n\"28 Days Later\" is one of my favorite movies in this genre and \"28 Weeks Later\" wasn't horrible, but this, this is not those movies.\r\n\r\nThis feels like \"Matrix: Resurrections\".\r\n\r\nThis feels like the director was told a movie was going to happen with or without him, so he made this.\r\n\r\nIf that ain't what happened, then I don't !@#$ing know, bruh.",

  "content": "Directed by Jake Schreier (Netflix’s Beef, Showtime’s Kidding) and written by Eric Pearson (Transformers One, Black Widow) and Joanna Calo (The Bear, Bojack Horseman), Thunderbolts* documents the emptiness surrounding Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) as she goes through the motions while working for the Ox Group led by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus).\r\n\r\nYelena still hasn’t recovered from Natasha/Black Widow’s death and is sick of killing people and doing villainous tasks for money. After a visit with her father figure Alexai Shostakov (David Harbour), Yelena decides to go straight and attempt to be a hero.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for her, de Fontaine is currently being investigated by the government and is on the verge of being impeached. Yelena’s last job is just an excuse for de Fontaine to tie up all her loose ends and appear innocent. Yelena finds herself trapped in a giant incinerator with U.S. Agent (Wyatt Russell), Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko), and a man plagued with memory loss named Bob (Lewis Pullman).\r\n\r\nThunderbolts* is a strange superhero film for a variety of reasons. The antihero dynamic already gives the film a dysfunctional Guardians of the Galaxy/Suicide Squad appeal, where a bunch of outcasts find refuge and redemption by working together as a team. But the film’s writing is interesting because Thunderbolts* doesn’t feature traditional character development. What these characters share is loss.\r\n\r\nIn a reveal that is likely not difficult to figure out, there’s more to Bob than Thunderbolts* lets on. Without fully spoiling the direction the film goes in with the character, Bob is able to see someone’s memories with physical touch. While this results in some interesting reveals from certain character’s pasts, it never really gets too deep even when Bob decides to share a bit more about what he’s gone through.\r\n\r\nWith Bob’s ability to enter people’s minds at will, the finale of Thunderbolts* has an Inception kind of element to it, but is more of a battle with inner demons than it is an all out CGI slugfest. The Thunderbolts* crash through dream barriers that alter physics while transitioning to whichever character is taking the lead in the sequence (the film typically goes back and forth between Yelena and Bob).\r\n\r\nBut the uniting of these characters still rides on trauma and loss. Yelena is searching for something to fill the emptiness inside of her. Alexei hasn’t been Red Guardian since the events of Black Widow and now drives a red limo for a job. He has completely lost whatever remained of his already dwindling super-soldier status.\r\n\r\nGhost no longer struggles to control her powers or her molecular status, but she does struggle with finding a purpose in this film. Apart from fighting and bickering with everyone, Ghost doesn’t add much to the film.\r\n\r\nU.S. Agent is in denial about no longer being Captain America. He acts like he has everything going for him, but has initially lost everything after the events of Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Valentina Allegra de Fontaine is on the verge of losing everything she’s been trying to build. Bob has always been alone. He’s never had friends and the void that has left inside him is quite literally a plot device for later in the film.\r\n\r\nBucky (Sebastian Stan) has been dabbling in Congress, but he’s kind of floundered around since Sam Wilson became the new Captain America. He’s not so secretly a part of the de Fontaine impeachment investigation and is searching for some sort of concrete evidence the only way The Winter Soldier can.\r\n\r\nThe film’s entertainment value is mostly invested in how unlikely this group of outcasts and shoehorned “heroes” are when they’re all trapped together in the same building. They initially start off being too stubborn to work together and it’s only once they learn how flawed the other costumed individuals are around them do they start to actually make a decent team.\r\n\r\nThere isn’t a ton of depth to Thunderbolts*, but it’s fun for what it is and is much more enjoyable than Captain America: Brave New World. The film is mostly setting up a new Avengers-like team for the next phase of the MCU although Sam Wilson’s Captain America is doing something similar. The film is purely worth seeing for Bob. The character has serious potential and Lewis Pullman has a clueless charm in his performance that coincides with one of the most powerful characters in the MCU.\r\n\r\nThunderbolts* is loaded with ass-kicking awesomeness. Florence Pugh is outstanding and Bob is the coolest character to come along in the MCU in a long, long time. Antiheroes are finally fun again.",

  "content": "Thunderbolts genuinely surprised me. I went in expecting a fun Marvel team up but got something even better: a fresh story, fantastic humor, and well-rounded characters that made it stand out in the MCU.\r\n\r\nThe Vault escape sequence was funny and memorable, capturing the chaotic spirit and humorous banter between the team. Valentina Allegra de Fontaine makes a standout villain, she was clever, cunning, and convincingly evil.\r\n\r\nThe character dynamics were great. Yelena Belova anchors the film emotionally, while Bucky Barnes feels more relatable and likeable than ever. Bob was a fun addition, bringing subtle humor and a few standout moments that added to the story's emotional beats and brought a few moments of intensity. The rest of the Thunderbolts comprising of Red Guardian, Ghost and U. S. Agent also shine, creating a team that's messy, fun, and surprisingly easy to root for.\r\n\r\nDirector Jake Schreier manages to strike a perfect balance between emotion, humor, and action, giving the film real heart amid the excitement. Although the ending was a bit unusual, it worked well. You could call the ending and the movie as a whole, bold, creative, and definitely memorable.\r\n\r\nOverall, Thunderbolts is a highly enjoyable MCU adventure that's a bit different from the norm - in the best possible way.\r\n\r\nDon't miss the end credit scene which got me pretty hyped about what Marvel has coming next.",

Prioritizing its broken protagonists' internal struggles over pure audiovisual spectacle shows a rare maturity in a franchise often criticized for sacrificing substance in favor of generic scale.\r\n\r\nThis bold approach allows the cast to shine - Florence Pugh especially, who firmly establishes herself as one of the MCU's core pillars. By exploring themes like depression, grief, abandonment, and reconnection with honesty and care, Jake Schreier transforms a blockbuster into a poignant meditation on shared purpose and what it means to live with open wounds.\r\n\r\nIn a landscape flooded with recycled formulas, Marvel has delivered something courageously human - making this Phase Five closing piece not only one of the year's biggest surprises but also one of the most emotionally resonant entries in the entire cinematic universe.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A",

  "content": "Superheroes are supposed to be special, gifted individuals, so it logically follows that movies about them should be equally special. However, as has become all too apparent in recent years, that quality has been steadily eroding in these films due to oversaturation in the cinematic marketplace, a circumstance that naturally begs the question, how special (i.e., how different or distinguished) can they really be when there are so many of them? Sadly, that's the key issue weighing down this latest release in the Marvel Universe. Even though the film serves as an introduction to a new slate of Marvel superheroes, the picture isn't particularly groundbreaking given the many similar offerings that have preceded it in this genre. Despite this film's few minor modifications to an otherwise-formulaic and shopworn narrative, in many respects, the picture's story feels like it's been cobbled together from elements in other superhero adventures. For instance, the band of heroes here consists largely of a collection of courageous misfits reminiscent of releases in the \"Suicide Squad\" franchise. Then there are the nerdy sidekicks, who feel like they've been culled from the \"Deadpool\" pictures. And the primary challenge these characters face comes from the threat of dubious weaponized technology wielded by a power-hungry leader, a scenario at the heart of films like \"X-men: Days of Future Past\" (2014) and \"Logan\" (2017). This patchwork of elements consequently makes for a plotline that frequently feels forced and somewhat disjointed yet also ultimately predictable. Its few departures from the tried and true, while modestly interesting, feel as though they've been included to silence critics as supposed evidence of the production's efforts to incorporate fresh new material. To its credit, \"Thunderbolts*\" features some genuinely funny comic relief and commendable performances by Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, though the action sequences come across as a little stale and the unimpressive CGI effects could use some shoring up. Director Jake Schreier does a capable job of doing what this film was essentially designed to do - give diehard Marvel fans another fix of what they truly crave. And that's fine as far as it goes. But, in terms of its contributions to the annals of filmdom, this is far from memorable filmmaking, especially in terms of originality. After all, cookie cutters are supposed to be used for making baked goods, not movies.",

  "content": "Hats off to Florence Pugh for injecting some charisma into this film, but otherwise I found it to be little different from the latest slew of “save the planet” Marvel adventures that follows a predictable pattern of escaping from the frying pan into the fire a few times before it culminates in a proud declaration that a new franchise has been born. It turns out that “Yelena” (Pugh) has been working for years as an assassin for the “Val” (Julia-Louise Dreyfus) whose director of the CIA seems to have been running unfettered off-the-books projects around the globe trying to impose her own brand of world order. The US Congress is breathing down her neck, now, though - so it is time to eliminate all the loose ends. Of course, that doesn’t quite go to plan and instead of disposing of the incriminating evidence, she merely galvanises an unlikely team of erstwhile employees of the agency to wreak their own vengeance. Meantime, the former “Winter Soldier” has got himself elected to the House and is now determined to work with those impeaching “Val” to bring her to book. Looks like “Buckie” (Sebastian Stan) might have to join this disparate group as it becomes clear that one of their number, the unassuming and pyjama-clad “Bob” (Lewis Pullman) might have more in common with “Brightburn” than “Superman”. What now ensues is the usual team-building exercise as they learn to trust each other, reveal secrets from their typically troubled pasts and, of course, kick some ass. David Harbour enthusiastically delivers his “Red Guardian” character, as does the very slightly menacing Pugh, but the others in the gang are all instantly forgettable and though ostensibly darker than many of its contemporaries, it still suffers from the perennial problem facing the whole MCU: they tee up these baddies with overwhelming psychological and physical prowess and yet you always know there will be sunlit uplands at the end. Stick around til the very end of the credits, though, for perhaps the most poignant part of this film. It is, after all, all about who sells the brand.",

  "content": "It's November 1st, 1971, I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron, who with her family, has been experiencing supernatural occurrences.\r\n\r\nThe key with The Conjuring is not that it has freshness on its side, as evidenced by the ream of horror fans arguing on internet sites about \"nothing new on the table\" , but while those fans will be going hungry for a very, very long time, The Conjuring does everything right for the splinter of horror it deals with.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot to admire about a horror film that in this day and age stands tall and proud against the ream of remakes, sequels and teen friendly slashers that \"haunt\" the multiplexes with all too much frequency these days. Free of gore and sex, this was automatically going to alienate a good portion of the lustful members of the horror fan base, but for those who like their horror served with appetising scares and a cauldron of suspense, then this delivers plenty to your particular table.\r\n\r\nForget the \"based on a true story\" tag, since it's kind of irrelevant in this new technological age, it's a selling gimmick that actually means \"this story might be true and we might have played with it a bit\". Regardless of hoax charges and embellishments, just buy into the premise, commit to it as a scary story in the same way as director James Wan has, for then the rewards are there for the compliant.\r\n\r\nStory essentially is based around an investigation in the early seventies by paranormal specialists Ed and Lorraine Warren, who aided the Perron family as they were victims of dreadful supernatural events at their Rhode Island home. Wan builds it deftly, letting us into the Perron families lives as they move into what they believe to be a dream home. Then things start to happen, but again Wan builds it in slow instances, creating a palpable sense of dread, his camera work intelligent. So when the big moments come they have maximum impact and have us also yearning for the Warren's to get involved.\r\n\r\nThere is no over killing of the boo-jump scares, they are placed with care and marry up superbly with the mounting tension. Naturally all the cliché conventions of the haunted house movie are here, strange smells, creaky doors, ominous cellar and etc, yet these are supplemented with Wan's talented knack for a good scare and a very effective production design. From mysterious bruises and literal leg pulls – breath holding games of hide and seek – to bona fide pant soiling moments, The Conjuring is a lesson in sustained unease until the big finale is unleashed.\r\n\r\nThe script is devoid of cheese and pointless filler, itself refreshing in a horror sub-genre that suffers often with these problems. Joseph Bishara's musical score is an absolute nerve shredder, and again it's a refreshing accompaniment because it doesn't resort to telegraphed shrieks to tell us to be afraid, it never overwhelms a scene. John Leonetti's cinematography has Gothic textures, both in the house and outside of the lakeside farmhouse, while the strong lead cast of Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston come up trumps for sure.\r\n\r\nMet with critical and box office success, The Conjuring justifies its reputation as a superb haunted house movie. 9/10",

  "content": "The Conjuring is a fairly classical horror/haunted house/exorcism movie. That was pretty much what I was hoping for. Slow and creepy build up to a final outburst and confrontation with an evil entity. This is a good movie although it is not really something new in terms of story. It is fairly impossible not to think about, and make comparisons with, The Amityville Horror when seeing this movie. I do not think it really deserves the glowing 9 or 10 star ratings that I have seen but it certainly do not merit those 1 or 2 star ones either. What were these people expecting?\r\n\r\nThis is a solid effort of making a movie along the classical lines of supernatural possession. As I wrote, it is not really something new, but it is nice to see a new movie using this kind of story without just turning it into a CGI gore-feast. Sure, the movie also includes the traditional pitfalls that most horror movies apparently must have like people thinking it is a good idea to walk down into the dark and scary basement all alone in the middle of the night.\r\n\r\nOne thing that irked me with the movie though was the idea of phantoms and performing exorcism being presented as kind of normal and accepted things. Of the movie would have played itself out 70 or so years earlier maybe but in the 1970′s? It just felt somewhat surreal to see this “ghosthunter” make presentations and talk to people like supernatural entities and the practice of exorcism was just things that happened.\r\n\r\nThe we have the ending of course. Not that it was overly bad but christ, if you are going to do an exorcism then do it damn it. Do not stop the procedure and look lost every time something goes bump.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I was not sure whether I was going to be disappointed or pleased when sitting down to watch this movie. On the whole I was pleased. It was a nice to watch a movie that was going back to the traditional values in horror movie making and it was as well implemented as one could expect.",

  "content": "\"Ed Warren\" (Patrick Wilson) and his wife \"Lorraine\" (Vera Farmiga) are renowned paranormal investigators drafted in by the at-their-wits-end \"Perron\" family to their remote Rhode Island farmhouse that they are convinced is possessed. It doesn't take them long to realise that this whole area has been the scene of Satanic worship since time immemorial, and those lingering spirits have got it in for the new occupants of the house - and their five increasingly hysterical daughters. James Wan really does develop this story with an effective degree of menace and Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor work well together as the parents scared out of their pants by the goings-on in their dream home that is turning into a nightmare that perhaps even an exorcism won't resolve. Joseph Bishara presents us with an eerily effective musical accompaniment to this story and the acrobatic and prosthetic visual effects all contribute effectively to create a real sense of malevolence that, unusually for many in this genre - it has a degree of plausibility too. Big screen experience is better especially in a busy cinema, and well worth a watch.",

  "content": "<em>'The Conjuring'</em> is an extremely solid supernatural horror. I admit that I did find it less interesting as it went on, but even so I did comfortably enjoy seeing the progression of the story; I like that the plot doesn't majorly meander, each stage is clear.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't rely on cheap jump scares either, which is something I was expecting it to utilise. The supernatural elements here are very well done, we don't see terribly much of the demons, at least early on, so any appearances are effective. The stuff with the kids/mum is convincing too.\r\n\r\nI was happy to see Vera Farmiga appear onscreen, I remember her fondly from 2011's <em>'Source Code'</em> and have wanted to see her in lead roles since - she's excellent in this. Patrick Wilson and Lili Taylor are also notable performers, while Joey King has one particularly great scene.\r\n\r\nI'd class this as more creepy than scary, admittedly I seldom find movies scary (just the way my brain is wired with fiction). I can obviously still sense when something is unsettling though, anything with kids being possessed does the job in that regard.\r\n\r\nHow this franchise has ten features and I hadn't even seen one is a mystery to me. Better late than never, hopefully this strong first entry is a sign of things to come.",

  "content": "When \"Moana\" learns that the whole of Pacific Island society is under a curse from the powerful god \"Nalo\", she has to recruit a few faithful crew members and go seek out \"Maui\" before she can find the long lost and sunken island of \"Morefutu\". Once there, she hopes to break the malevolent force that has, for centuries, ensured that her people never manage to make contact with any others - despite her finding evidence that they did exist - somewhere, once upon a time! Of course there's \"Heihei\" the chicken and \"Pua\" the pig, but she's gonna need more help than that so up steps pin-up \"Moni\", the knife-wielding engineer \"Loto\" and the glass-half-empty farmer \"Keke\" and off they go. Loads of escapades await them as they again encounter their poisoned-dart firing coconut warriors - the \"Kakamora\", a giant clam and, of course, the winds and the seas as the mischievous \"Matangi\" and her army of bats tries to make life as difficult as they can. Luckily, \"Matangi\" has also had a run-in with \"Maui\" and so maybe they can all unite now, but can his giant hook and his tattoos empower him to help her to defeat their powerful nemesis? Well, what do you think? Thing is, we're not watching this for any jeopardy or menace from the storyline, we are watching it for the fun characterisations and the engaging dynamic between the eponymous girl and her super-strength demigod. That, sadly, is sadly lacking in this disappointing sequel. The visual effects are super, and the pace of the adventure likewise - but the story is just too thin and the arrival of the new characters doesn't really compensate as it rather procedurally, if colourfully, meanders along without really delving into and exploiting the fantastic depths of culture and mythology at it's disposal. The soundtrack is also nowhere near as catchy, and even though some of the lyrics are quite entertaining, the film lacks a killer song for either leading character. Sure, we've the power ballad \"Beyond\" and \"Maui\" gets the quirky \"Can I Get a Chee Chee\", but they lack the charming silliness of Lin Manuel Miranda's efforts from eight years ago. It's all perfectly watchable, and ought to be seen on a big screen to show off the creatively detailed animation, but I reckon it's entirely forgettable and will probably just serve as a stepping stone to the next one which is certain to follow just as seagulls follow fishing boats.",

From the very first scene, I was absolutely hooked, and it didn't let go until the credits rolled.\r\n\r\nThe story? Oh my gosh, the story! It was so clever and well-crafted. It had twists and turns I never saw coming, but it all made perfect sense in the end. It was like a puzzle that slowly came together, and every piece was perfectly placed. You know when a movie makes you think? This one definitely did that. It wasn't just mindless action or fluff; it had real substance.\r\n\r\nAnd the characters! They were so real and relatable. I felt like I knew them, like I was right there with them on their journey. They had depth, they had flaws, they had moments that made me laugh, and moments that made me want to cry. I was completely invested in what happened to them. The actors did an amazing job bringing them to life. You could feel their emotions through the screen.\r\n\r\nVisually, it was stunning. The way it was shot, the colors, the sets – everything was just beautiful. It wasn't just pretty to look at, though; it also added to the story and the mood. Some scenes were so powerful, they'll stay with me for a long time. The music was also perfect! It really enhanced the emotions and made everything even more impactful.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I can't think of a single thing I didn't like about this movie. It had everything: a great story, amazing characters, beautiful visuals, and a fantastic soundtrack. It made me feel so many different things, and it left me thinking long after it was over. If you're looking for a movie that will take you on a journey and leave you completely satisfied, this is it. Trust me, you won't be disappointed! It's a 10/10 masterpiece in my book!",

  "content": "<em>'A Minecraft Movie'</em> is, eh, a great time? I'm genuinely taken aback by how much I actually enjoyed this one. All 101 minutes are extremely stupid and silly, but they lean into it so much that I happily managed to look past it. It entertained me, what can I say?\r\n\r\nI did play Minecraft growing up but only casually, though I did admittedly heavily watch YouTubers play it (s/o Mindcrack, CaptainSparklez, ChimneySwift11 lmao). Personally, I was more a superflat, creative world type of guy, the amount of time I wasted (nay, embraced) building 'true to life' cities... good times.\r\n\r\nDespite not being super into the game's inner workings, I still picked up plenty of calls to the game which is fun. The world itself here feels fun and vibrant, they take some creative license but it only turns out positive.\r\nBased on early shots I saw pre-release, I didn't like the look but in actuality the animation is excellent.\r\n\r\nThe humour is strong too, I was chuckling all the way through - rather unexpectedly. Much of the comedy is played for adults as well, I would've predicted it'd be more directly for kids; not that there's anything crazy in this, but it's not super dumbed down, which is pleasant. It all has a pulse, that's for sure.\r\n\r\nJack Black is funny, he fully commits to the role of Steve and, for me, it ended up being somewhat of a perfect performance to be honest; no-one would've bettered Black. I wasn't actually sold when I heard the casting, so I'm glad I was wrong. Jason Momoa is the same, especially after seeing trailers.\r\n\r\nMomoa is very good in this, as are the whole cast in truth. Sebastian Hansen, Emma Myers and Danielle Brooks are all pluses. Rachel House brings strong voice work, while Jennifer Coolidge (and Hiram Garcia) have solid smaller parts too. A cast that surpassed my (admittedly aimless) expectations.\r\n\r\nIn fact, that last sentence just about sums up my overall thoughts on this 2025 release. I'm sure I should not have liked this as much as I did, but here we are! If you told me hours ago that I'd be giving it this rating, I'd have called you an absolute nutter.\r\n\r\nBased on the general reaction I'm seeing, I should probably keep my thoughts on this quiet. I am susceptible to a supposed bad movie every now and then, leave me alone. Mind you, many others do agree with me so... goat video game adaptation?!",

But Harry is soon to find out that his past, and his destiny, is a truly remarkable, magical, and terrifying thing.\r\n\r\nHarry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone arrived in a blaze of publicity, one of the most hyped and talked about motion pictures of the decade had finally arrived. The box office was guaranteed to bulge based on fandom book base alone, regardless of if the film got bad word of mouth or not, it was destined to be a monster smash hit. To someone like me who to this day has never read any of the Harry Potter books, it was easy for me to view objectively without comparison to the source - I enjoyed it immensely upon theatre release, and I still enjoy it equally as much now.\r\n\r\nDirector Christopher Columbus, I believe has wisely stayed loyal to the source material, and thus pleased the literature masses. Yet not all newcomers to the party were that taken by the magic on show, that's a little baffling to me because the budget explodes from the screen at every turn. Oliver Twist like sets form the marvellous Diagon Alley, dream like smoke cloaks the splendid Hogwarts Express, the school itself is a monolithic delight nestling in among eerie mountains - and what about the exhilarating introduction of Quidditch? Pulsating and frantic with no amount of devilment to keep us intrigued throughout.\r\n\r\nThe characters are all perfectly formed in the first two thirds of the film, here Columbus pulls off a masterstroke by interjecting the character arcs with dashes of wonder so that we the audience never gets bored. The final reel plays out solidly as per the mysterious \"who done it\" core of the piece, but it's down to the previous work in the film that we actually care come the finale. Some great casting of the adults really helps to make the film triumph, with Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane (one of the best casting jobs of the decade I would say), Richard Harris, Alan Rickman and Zoe Wanamaker all doing excellent work here. The kids are all newcomers that overnight were to become household names, all fresh faced and wet behind the ears, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint & Tom Felton are a delight to watch, and they all help to keep the feeling of charm constantly glowing up on the screen.\r\n\r\nOwls here, witches there, what's that strange three headed dog doing over there? The Harry Potter franchise begins with a bang and a whip of the wand, and I and gazillions of others personally love it. 8/10",

Despite its minor drawbacks, it does enough to intrigue the viewer and kept me engaged.\r\n\r\nThe performances are a little off, which is expected as this film is primarily carried by three twelve-year-olds. But they get better as the film progresses and the adults in the film are able to bring the average up with their amazing performances.\r\n\r\nOverall, this movie suffers from being dated with poor effects, CGI, and some rough child acting.

That she worked closely with Chris Columbus in the creation of this adaptation of her introductory story featuring the boy-wizard means it stays broadly faithful to the book but allows the imagery to replace, rather than duplicate, the narrative. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson validate the best in the casting director's art as we set off on this wonderfully enjoyable fantasy adventure. The supporting cast - Richard Harris, Robbie Coltrane, Julie Walters, Zoë Wanamaker et al all add richness to this as young \"Mr. Potter\" and is friends begin to realise their magical potential. John Williams works his wonders creating a score almost as recognisable as his \"Star Wars\" theme and the special effects are gentle, yet sophisticated. It is a bit on the lengthy side, and some of the adaptation sacrifices a little of the humour from the book - but all in all a movie to stand the tests of time.",

  "content": "The Substance delivers an intense, visually mesmerizing commentary on the entertainment industry's obsession with youth and outward beauty. Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley offer remarkable, maybe even career-best performances, with Dennis Quaid excelling in his role as well. Coralie Fargeat explores how aging stars, particularly women, are discarded when they no longer meet the industry's strict beauty standards. Moore's character, haunted by the memory of her former fame and beauty, goes down a dark path in pursuit of a \"better\" version of herself. The story is also a sharp critique of power dynamics, with white men controlling who's in front of the spotlight, while women are pitted against one another for validation.\r\n\r\nThe film's production is equally impressive, especially the makeup and prosthetic work that elevates its body horror elements. While the first half of the movie is more subdued, the gore ramps up significantly as the plot unfolds, culminating in a chaotic \"fourth act\" that will leave audiences bewildered. The fast-paced editing, paired with an impactful score, heightens the tension and surrealism of the narrative. Though there's a part of me who prefers a version of the film that ends before the wild final act, the overall experience is an unforgettable, audacious exploration of vanity, control, and desperation in the entertainment world.\r\n\r\nRating: B+",

  "content": "For a film that’s laser-focused on the human body, it’s gloriously on point that THE SUBSTANCE begins with a freshly cracked, bright yellow egg yolk. \r\n\r\nEggs are the ‘giver of life’, right? They’re the origin of all of us. Gleaming and plump, the yolk suddenly gets pricked – not by a fork, but a syringe.\r\n\r\nThat’s the first juicy visual metaphor of many in this meaningfully bonkers body horror, for which French filmmaker Coralie Fargeat picked up the prestigious Best Screenplay prize at this year’s Cannes Film Festival.\r\n\r\nTo call the film ‘bold’ is a weapons-grade understatement. It’s an audacious, jaw-dropping examination of what screens & billboards demand of women (especially as they age), and how laughably impossible it is to meet those demands. Well, if you didn’t laugh, you’d cry. After watching THE SUBSTANCE, you might do both.\r\n\r\nHere's our deep dive for good.film: https://good.film/guide/holy-sh-t-the-substance-is-a-weapons-grade-takedown-of-the-male-gaze",

  "content": "There’s a big difference between being funny and being laughable, yet the latest from writer-director Coralie Fargeat has somehow found a way to be both. After amassing a considerable amount of largely well-earned cinematic goodwill in the film’s opening segments, the picture mercilessly squanders that support in the final act with an overlong, meandering, disgustingly gratuitous and grotesque exhibition of utterly bad taste. This story of an aging actress (Demi Moore) who seeks to revive her career by retrieving some of her lost youth with the aid of an enigmatic injectable follows her grand misadventures when the mysterious substance prompts the emergence of a younger doppelganger (Margaret Qualley), who becomes a Hollywood sex kitten sensation virtually overnight. To make this experimental venture work, however, the two individuals must follow a complex set of rules, dictates that become increasingly difficult to follow as they each vie for their respective shares of attention. And, as this scenario unfolds, tension grows between them, leading to complications and unexpected developments that become progressively harder to manage. But that’s where what works in the film ends. As the story plays out from there, it becomes stupendously absurd, and, even though there are some hearty laughs in this, there are even more ridiculously implausible and unexplained occurrences that try audience members’ patience and tolerance, so much so that I couldn’t wait for this trainwreck to end. In addition to the foregoing shortcomings, the film includes myriad changes in tone, making it difficult to determine whether this is supposed to be a serious thriller or a campy road, very much in the same way as in the incomprehensible French offering “Titane” (2021). It also shamelessly “borrows” elements from other movies in various ways, most notably imagery and narrative references from “The Shining” (1980) and “Young Frankenstein” (1974), costume designs from the “Hunger Games” franchise, and bafflingly inexplicable soundtrack excerpts from films like “Vertigo” (1958). Then there’s the picture’s obvious, heavy-handed message about the perils of misogyny, observations that, as important as they are, could easily stood to have been turned down more than a few notches (yes, we get it already). At the same time, though, there are also some fundamentally innate questions about the narrative that go wholly unanswered, leaving us with numerous head-scratching moments. Sadly, these failings detract significantly from the elements that do work (at least early on in the film), such as the fine performances of Moore and Qualley, the picture’s inventive cinematography, and a central premise that could have made for an engaging story if handled with greater finesse. But these strengths are effectively cancelled by what ultimately results when this release goes off the rails. Indeed, how “The Substance” captured the 2024 Cannes Film Festival award for best screenplay is truly mind boggling. I’m certainly a fan of the weird, wild and wacky, but this release undermines the virtues of those cherished qualities. Regrettably, I was seriously looking forward to seeing this offering, and I was decidedly impressed by what I saw in its opening acts, but that was all wiped out by how this one ultimately played out, a picture that, in the end, ironically relied more on style than “substance.”",

  "content": "This takes a logical step on from Coralie Fargeat's earlier \"Reality+\" (2014) drama, only this time it takes a much more substantial swipe at all things vain. \"Elisabeth\" (Demi Moore) has been at the top of her fitness game for many a year when her boss \"Harvey\" (Dennis Quaid) decides that she's now too old and that a younger model is needed to present those programmes we all saw on the television of gorgeous, fit and healthy, people showing us how to exercise on a mat in from of our televisions each morning. Distracted by her imminent removal, she is involved in a car accident that introduces her to an handsome young nurse (Robin Grear) and then to a curious invitation to test out a mysterious fluid that can essentially give her her cake and eat it. In best \"Jekyll and Hyde\" tradition, injecting this quite literally creates a split personality. One is her current self, the other a perfect, younger specimen. They work in a rota system each gets a week of consciousness then has to take a week out. Thing is, the more vivacious character \"Sue\" (Margaret Qualley) is not so religious about sticking to these sharing rules and we quickly discover that what is \"borrowed\" can never been returned - with increasingly harrowing results. With the gushing \"Harvey\" determined to capitalise on his new ratings winner, things become decidedly irritating for the now marginalised \"Elisabeth\" - but shat can she do? There's no going back...! I think this is Moore at her best. Her palpable sense of evolving fury, exasperation and frustration is expertly captured as is the selfishness of her alter ego by an on form Qualley. Quaid steals his scenes as the truly odious epitome of corporate greed for whom it's all about the business, the money and never the actual people concerned. The denouement is reminiscent of something concocted by one of the David's - Lynch or Cronenberg, and allows the throbbing ghastliness of this story of vanity gone mad to demonstrate just how fickle life can be when there's little actual substance at all to their shallow and vacuous lives. A savage indictment of the short-term and unprincipled \"beauty\" industry that aims squarely at just about everyone and everything involved, is engagingly toxic and well worth a watch.",

  "content": "Certainly an experience!\r\n\r\n<em>'The Substance'</em> is <b>a lot</b>. It's one of those sorta movies that I needed to let settle in my mind before I even started to think about reviewing it. I'm not even sure where to start. It's insane from pretty much the beginning to the very end of its 140 minute run time, some scenes are particularly rough to watch unfold!\r\n\r\nI think the only body horror flick I've seen up until this point is David Cronenberg's <em>'Crimes of the Future'</em> from 2022, which I found to be solid enough but it came across, at least to me, as a bit too forced for shock value. This 2024 release has plenty of that, if not more, but it somehow feels totally at home with what surrounds it.\r\n\r\nThe story itself is fascinating, even taking out all the craziness with the gore et al. So by no means is this a film that is style over substance (sorry). It isn't anything actually overly original in terms of the base plotline, though the way it is portrayed and brought to life is astounding - every inch is expertly crafted.\r\n\r\nDemi Moore is outstanding in this! I haven't seen her in much, at least anything released post-2002, but here she is top quality throughout. Margaret Qualley is obviously the opposite in terms of the former, though is just as fantastic in regards to the latter - great performance!\r\n\r\nIf you see anyone giving warnings ahead of watching this, they are very much warranted! Even with all the graphic twistedness, which will turn many away, this is an impressively enthralling picture. I may need a lie-down though.",

Brilliant!\r\n\r\nWhile on the face, this movie is about aging out of Hollywood's graces, the script is also laced with interesting subplots: having a proxy that ages for you a la Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray, and the subject of shallow self-hate and self-love, along with that \"needy for applause\" character that so many actors have and must either learn to deal, or fail at life.\r\n\r\nDemi Moore is nothing short of awesome here.

  "content": "**The Substance (2024)**\r\nA Visceral Exploration of Youth Obsession and the Fear of Time\r\n\r\n\"The Substance\" is a bold cinematic experience that masterfully resurrects the practical effects of 1980s horror, delivering a visual and auditory feast that is both nostalgic and groundbreaking. Directed with a keen eye for detail, the film delves deep into society's obsession with youth and the inevitable passage of time, offering a thought-provoking commentary wrapped in visceral horror.\r\nThe film follows a renowned actress, portrayed by Demi Moore, who grapples with the fear of aging and losing her fame. In a desperate attempt to reclaim her youth, she becomes entangled with a mysterious substance that promises vitality but comes with horrifying consequences. As she navigates this treacherous path, the lines between reality and obsession blur, leading to a descent into madness.\r\nAt its core, \"The Substance\" is a critique of the 21st-century fixation on youth over the value of life experience. It echoes themes from classics like \"Death Becomes Her\" and \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" highlighting the shame associated with aging and the societal pressure to maintain perpetual youthfulness. The film questions whether society promotes a 'sexy reality' at the expense of genuine substance and wisdom.\r\nThe narrative explores the concept of cheating death, not just literally but metaphorically, as a fear of social death—being forgotten or replaced. This is poignantly portrayed through Moore's character, who embodies the desperation of clinging to relevance in a world that idolizes the new and discards the old.\r\n\r\n**Practical Effects and Gore**\r\nFrom the opening scenes, it's evident that the physical effects are a labor of love—a homage to the era before CGI dominated horror. The gore is unapologetically front and center, reminiscent of Cronenberg's \"The Fly,\" pushing the boundaries of on-screen grotesque. The disturbingly realistic blood effects, combined with meticulously crafted sound design, amplify the discomfort, making the audience squirm.\r\n\r\n**Color Palette and Visual Aesthetics**\r\nThe color palette is meticulously crafted, bathing scenes in hues that evoke unease and familiarity simultaneously. The use of shadows and lighting enhances the suspense, while the wardrobe and costume design serve as narrative devices, illustrating the juxtaposition between youth and age, purity and corruption.\r\n\r\n**Performances**\r\nDemi Moore delivers a stellar performance, capturing the vulnerability and desperation of a woman battling the relentless march of time. Her portrayal adds depth to the film's themes, embodying the internal decay and obsession manifesting physically through the substance. The supporting cast also contributes significantly, with each character representing different facets of society's views on youth and aging.\r\n\r\n**Critique**\r\nWhile the film excels in many areas, it isn't without flaws. The ending feels abrupt, leaving several narrative threads untied, which may leave some viewers unsatisfied. Additionally, the persistent focus on teen emotional states can be grating, potentially alienating those seeking a more mature exploration of the presented themes.\r\n\r\n**Engaging with the Hype**\r\n\"The Substance\" has generated significant buzz online, sparking discussions about its innovative use of practical effects and its deep societal commentary. The hype seems to stem from both horror enthusiasts who appreciate the throwback to classic techniques and audiences resonating with its timely themes. However, it's worth considering whether the film is merely feeding into the very cycle of superficiality it aims to criticize.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Substance\" is a visceral commentary on the fear of aging, the obsession with youth, and the inevitable march of time. It challenges viewers to reflect on their perceptions of age, experience, and what truly holds value. By drawing parallels with films like \"Gremlins,\" \"Frankenstein,\" \"A Christmas Carol,\" and \"Carrie,\" it positions itself as a modern amalgamation of timeless themes.\r\nDespite its imperfections, the film succeeds in sparking conversation—a hallmark of impactful cinema. It's as uncomfortable as it is thought-provoking, demanding to be felt and discussed. Whether you love it or hate it, \"The Substance\" is a noteworthy addition to the horror genre that holds up a mirror to society's own fears and obsessions.\r\n\r\n**Extra Thoughts**\r\n- The film raises pertinent questions about our role in perpetuating the fear of aging. Are we complicit in creating a world where experience is devalued?\r\n- The character dynamics suggest that embracing change and maintaining balance might be key to a fulfilling life, even if it comes at a cost.\r\n- The hype surrounding the movie could reflect its resonance with audiences grappling with similar fears and obsessions in today's youth-centric culture.\r\n\r\n**Final Recommendation**\r\n\"The Substance\" may not offer all the answers, but it provides a platform for dialogue on important societal issues. Its blend of classic horror techniques with contemporary themes makes it a film worth experiencing. If you're a fan of thought-provoking horror that goes beyond mere scares, this movie deserves a place on your watchlist.",

  "content": "\"The Substance\" is something of a cinematic mash up. \r\n\r\nFirst off, this story is somewhat  reminiscent of \"Death Becomes Her\". The 1992 film starring Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn and Bruce Willis. \r\n\r\nThe notion of the fatal conceit in the search for eternal youth amongst the ageing Hollywood set is very much central to the story in both films.\r\n\r\nThat said, the handling is distinctly different. This film is a lot louder, gaudier, brasher, cruder and ruder, than its 90's counterpart by a country mile. There are elements I'd typically associate with Lovecraft too, that are grotesque, monstrous and disturbing. \r\n\r\nThis work is also more a visually clever, as opposed to a compelling narrative based experience. Its messages are conveyed, like Hollywood itself, through larger than life youthful glitz and glamour but also an innate, ephemeral shallowness.A shallowness that becomes a kind of obsessive prison, denying those trapped in it, any meaningful form of human intimacy.\r\n\r\nMy only criticism of what I do feel is a very good film, is it overplays its hand. Its so over the top in the latter part of the film, I felt it partly drowned out the message, it had, up to that point, convincingly conveyed. The closing scenes. in particular, felt crude, clumsy and would have worked considerably better, with more controlled and subtle, handling. \r\n\r\nIn summary, \"The Substance\" is a rather clever film that uses the eye of the lens to expose how what we see, in Hollywood at least, is more important than who we are. People are shiny commodities to be replaced when the beautiful image they portray starts to wither away. As we see, youth and beauty is everything, no matter the price. \r\n\r\nI will say too, this is by no means a perfect cinematic experience. It can be over the top, especially in the latter part of the film. That said, there is, on balance, more to like here than not. Definitely worth a look.",

As you'd expect with Ryan Reynolds in this role, the jokes are plentiful and there is barely any time to react to one before another appears. That can sometimes not work as well as intended, e.g. <em>'Deadpool 2'</em>, but here the humour is executed perfectly.\r\n\r\nReynolds himself is quality, it is a quintessential Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool performance. It's real neat to see Hugh Jackman back as Wolverine, he does play second fiddle to the other titular character but still more than holds his own, as you'd expect. Emma Corrin, meanwhile, enters the MCU with a great showing.\r\n\r\nAs noted at the top, I do think the plot couldn't been superior - but not in a negative way. What is portrayed is still entertaining to watch, it's just not necessarily on the same level as the comedic elements. A fun watch, all the same. Do I like it more than the 2016 original?

  "content": "In moviemaking, sadly, there can be a problem with going to the well too many times, and this latest installment in one of filmdom’s better cinematic franchises verges on proving just that. This offering’s predecessors (2016, 2018) significantly distinguished themselves from the kind of fare typically found in the superhero genre with their outrageously bawdy humor, hilarious sight gags and relentlessly maverick attitude. This time out, however, director Shawn Levy’s latest effort is a decidedly hit or miss affair, with an often-incoherent script that feels like it was cobbled together from a collection of leftover parts, some of which work and some of which don’t. I suppose that’s not entirely surprising from a screenplay that was penned by four different writers, making me wonder how much consensus was in place in compiling the finished product. Moreover, this film appears to be intended to fold the Deadpool franchise into the X-Men franchise, an intriguing idea that, regrettably, is handled rather clumsily (as has often been the case with many other recent fusion offerings in the Marvel Universe). And, if all that weren’t bad enough, this release gives short shrift to the colorful cast of supporting players that made the Deadpool films so funny, original and enjoyable, relegating them to little more than cameos in favor of walk-ons by a host of other MCU characters (some of them remarkably obscure, I might add) in an attempt to help cement the franchise cross-pollination going on here. It makes for awkward storytelling at times, especially for viewers who might not be familiar with these lesser-known figures, some of which are drawn from Marvel source material unrelated to its big screen offerings. To the picture’s credit, it features yet another stellar turn by Ryan Reynolds as the off-color protagonist, as well as its share of hilarious bits (without a doubt the franchise’s historically strongest suit), including a number of unabashed, razor-sharp asides referencing off-screen developments related to the studios that produced these films and the actors who have appeared in them. These strengths notwithstanding, however, this is a production that has sadly watered down the elements that best made this franchise work in favor of an overarching programming agenda that simply doesn’t serve this film or the series particularly well. The creators would have served themselves and viewers better by sticking with what works and the basics of good storytelling than trying to force an issue for the sake of future productions that may or may not work over the long term. This has been a noticeable downfall in the quality of many of the most recent Marvel Universe releases, and I’d truly hate to see this franchise befall a similar fate.",

  "content": "Well the \"Deadpool\" concept is now well and truly immersed in the Marvel multi-verse and I really did fear for good old \"Dead\". More of the same? Well, no actually. Ryan Reynolds has reverted more to the occasionally quite vulgar humour of the first film (2016) and allowed this trequel to focus more on the personality of this irreverent, immortal, superhero as he tries to resurrect the recently departed \"Wolverine/Logan\" (Hugh Jackman) so he can save his timeline from erasure. To do that, and thwart the comically menacing \"Paradox\" (Matthew Macfadyen), he has to face down \"Cassandra Nova\" (Emma Corrin) - who happens to be the long estranged twin sister of \"Xavier\" who presides over the void. That's a \"Mad Max\" style desert style territory where all the undesirables have been put by \"Paradox\" and his organisation over the years. Initially, there's no love lost between our two heroes. The cocky man in red lycra does not impress his new, booze-soaked and guilt-ridden buddy, but quickly they manage to align their priorities and then - well yes, you can guess the rest. Indeed, there's nothing remotely unpredictable about any of this, but what it does do is shout loudly and proudly that it knows it. It's not trying to reinvent the wheel, it's succeeding in pointing out that all of these multi-verse films that simply adjust the space/time continuum to provide a new setting for the same old stories ad characters has to stop before we (the audience) bore further of their repetitive combat cycles and nondescript plot lines. Maybe Reynolds does over-egg the smuttiness a little but there are still plenty of wry comments about the industry, product placement and the plethora of films (and actors) that have preceded it delivering same old same old. It's not forgotten to entertain us too - there are loads of action scenes and there's an amiable chemistry between two actors who are clearly on the same, suitably sarcastic, page throughout a two hours that also features a some fun cameos from the likes of Messrs. Evans, Snipes, Cavill, Favreau and Tatum to keep it moving along with an effervescence of spirit. It's a big screen essential, there's a lot of effort gone into the production that won't work so well on the telly, and I enjoyed it.",

  "content": "Deadpool and Wolverine is a movie that I truly believe the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has needed for a while. After years of lackluster installments, this film is a breath of fresh air. Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, and director Shawn Levy approached this project with care and a deep understanding of what fans want. The film feels like it was crafted by fans for fans, particularly those who have been frustrated by the recent phases of the MCU.\r\n\r\nReynolds and Levy brought on a team of writers with a strong background in comedy and storytelling. This decision pays off, as the film’s humor and narrative are both sharp and engaging. For example, the meta vibe of Deadpool, familiar from the previous two films, is ramped up significantly. The movie spares no one, making jokes about everything from Hugh Jackman’s recent divorce to Ryan Reynolds' career. However, it’s the MCU that receives the most pointed and critical jokes, which will resonate with long-time fans.\r\n\r\nThe chemistry between Reynolds and Jackman is electric, bringing new life to both characters. Their dynamic is both hilarious and heartfelt, making for a compelling narrative. For instance, scenes where Deadpool and Wolverine banter while taking down enemies are filled with wit and energy, showcasing their unique bond. This camaraderie extends to the film’s supporting cast, with well-timed cameos and clever nods to previous Marvel movies.\r\n\r\nThe film's self-awareness and willingness to poke fun at its own franchise are refreshing. This level of meta-commentary sets the film apart from typical superhero fare.\r\n\r\nDespite its comedic approach, the film doesn’t skimp on emotional depth. The storyline is carried by genuine heart, particularly in how it addresses themes of redemption and friendship. The climax is especially impactful, ranking among the greats in the franchise.\r\n\r\nThis isn't just a good sequel; it's a game-changer for the MCU. The film successfully integrates Deadpool into the broader Marvel Cinematic Universe while maintaining his unique tone and style. It sets the stage for future installments, promising exciting developments ahead. The way the film navigates these transitions feels seamless, ensuring that Deadpool’s irreverent humor doesn’t clash with the MCU’s established tone.\r\n\r\nOverall, Deadpool and Wolverine is a standout entry in the MCU, offering a perfect blend of humor, action, and heart. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman deliver top-notch performances, supported by a smart script and deft direction from Shawn Levy. This film not only redeems past missteps in the franchise but also paves the way for a promising future. It’s a must-watch for any Marvel fan, filled with laughter, thrills, and touching moments that elevate it above many of its predecessors.",

Yes, and I will GLADLY give them my money for another movie that just wants to entertain.  And if they make another movie that wants to entertain and not push an agenda, I will gladly give them MORE of my money... because at the end of the day, entertainment has been in a decade long drought brought to you by political lecturing and nerd domains have been intentionally attacking fans rather than making movies, like this, that make fans want to give them their money.\r\n\r\nSo when a movie like this comes along, it is a wonderful thing.",

I loved that you could see genuine guitar chords being played, so often in live action films the playing of musical instruments, especially guitar are poorly faked.

Although I really enjoyed _Moana_, I thought it was a little bit too much of a pastiche of multiple Pacific cultures when it should have just picked one (Maori) and stuck with it.  _Coco_ celebrates Mexican culture, and depicts it well.

This is why I don't, personally, look up about films before watching them, I love being surprised.\r\n\r\nBig credit also goes to the cast, who play some awesome characters. From Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez) to Héctor (Gael García Bernal) to Ernesto (Benjamin Bratt), among others, they are all very, very good.\r\n\r\nIt isn't just the characters that make this memorable, it is also the excellent plot which is told beautifully. It's filled with not just comedy but also a load of heart - there's a few nicely done twists too. The world that they create around the Day of the Dead is fantastic, while the music fits perfectly.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't already, you must watch this! It's brilliant!",

  "content": "Budding guitarist \"Miguel\" is puzzled by his family's long-established ban on anything musical. To him it just doesn't make any sense at all especially as, generations ago, his family were at the top of that very game. Determined to get to the bottom of that mystery so he can emulate the legendary heart-throb \"Ernesto\" (a cross between Julio Iglesias and Justin Bieber), he finds that serendipity takes an hand in things. On the Day of the Dead, he manages to get himself transported to the the vibrant and surprisingly lively land of the dead where he encounters the slightly mischievous \"Hector\" who promises to guide him to his great, great grand-father, find the truth and enable him to return home to a family that will, once again, embrace music. He has to get a move on though, as he only has the hours of darkness to fulfil his quest - so the race is on. Meantime some of his other, long deceased, family are also on his trail bent on returning him home without his music. To be honest, I found the underlying tale of loyalty and family to be just a bit overly-sentimental at times, but the quality and vivacity of the animation is a class apart - huge great eyes and smiles that tell the story so much better than words ever could. The story marries the musical with the dastardly and mysterious nicely with a well written script and a quickly paced storyline that is really quite entertaining. This works better on a big screen - it really shows the animators art off to best effect and, luckily, this has plenty for the adult audience too with some engagingly quirky characters.",

  "content": "Director Francis Lawrence’s screen adaptation of Stephen King’s novel by the same name is one of those pictures that makes me want to stand up in the theater and exclaim that the Emperor is indeed naked (though I’d probably be quickly escorted from the moviehouse if I did so). The source material for this production, originally written at the time of the Vietnam War, was an allegory about the draft and its impact on young American men at the time, a mandate that often led to their deaths in an unpopular and largely unexplained conflict. And it’s a statement that’s admittedly still valid (albeit perhaps not as relevant) all these many years later. However, the story’s translation from book to screen in the present day leaves much to be desired, in part because its message isn’t as timely as when the book was written and in part because of the film’s stunningly poor execution. “The Long Walk” tells the tale of a feebly justified (and even more poorly explained) grim ritual in which 50 young men selected from a nationwide lottery embark on a nonstop march in which they must maintain a minimum 3 mph walking speed. Their determined efforts in this symbolic venture are supposedly intended to inspire the population to become more productive citizens in a dystopian version of America as it recovers from a great war. But those who fail to sustain their pace are mercilessly gunned down after three warnings (and who said cold-blooded killing isn’t motivational?). The last man standing in this open-ended competition is named the “winner,” an accomplishment that entitles him to whatever he wishes as a reward. Symbolism and literary surrealism aside, however, the premise behind this work is utterly absurd, especially since participation in the march is voluntary, a betrayal of one of the principal thematic elements of the source material in allegorically criticizing an underlying inhumane mandate. Given that, then, who in their right mind would sign up for something like this? But, beyond the inherent lunacy of its premise (not to mention its contradictory and countless logically implausible plot elements), the picture fails as a well-crafted, engaging work of cinema. To begin with, it commits the cardinal moviemaking sin of predictability, its narrative events and ultimate outcome largely visible from miles away. Next, its storyline quickly becomes tediously repetitive with only minor deviations in plot devices along the way. Its billing as a horror flick is seriously misplaced, as it’s not particularly scary – just gratuitously gross whose shock value impact and multiple disgusting references to bodily functions fade rapidly by going to the same tiresome well far too many times. And, on top of all that, it’s often terribly boring, loaded with protracted conversations among bland, monodimensional characters that just aren’t especially compelling or profound. The screenplay driving all this appears to draw its inspiration from the narratives in pictures like “Platoon” (1986) and any number of classic World War II buddy films but with less articulate and attention-holding writing. To its credit, the film valiantly attempts to infuse the story with insights related to contemporary social and political issues, though these efforts sadly remain largely underdeveloped. What’s more, there are missed opportunities here, too, such as the picture’s failure to make a definitive statement about the bloodsport nature of the event given its popularity with a rapt, admiring and inexplicably reverential public that’s able to watch the entire spectacle via a live video feed. When all of these elements (or should I say shortcomings?) are combined, you’ve got one ridiculously hot cinematic mess (handily one of the worst releases of 2025), one that probably would have been more aptly titled “Roadkill.” I find it puzzling that this offering from the director of four of the five “Hunger Games” franchise releases was unable to work his magic once again in this release in light of the similar nature of this project. However, in my view, this production misses the mark by such a wide margin that, if the sharp-shooters in this story had an aim comparable to that of the director, no one would have died by the time the closing credits roll. But, then, maybe we would have been better off with a picture that produced such an outcome, given that there’s little redeeming entertainment, enlightenment or educational value in this cinematic debacle. And, no matter what anyone might say, in the end, the Emperor is still naked.",

  "content": "This review contains spoilers.\r\n\r\nAs you can probably tell, this isn't a \"good movie 10/10\" type review and I honestly don't know how to write a good one without spoiling things.\r\nI believe these spoilers are necessary to understand just how disappointing the film is and that they don't deter from the movie's \"experience\". You can already guess that half of the characters will die after the first night and that the main character and his best friend will be the last two remaining.\r\n\r\nAlso, art is subjective. The review below is my opinion. I'm not claiming that it's the objective truth.\r\n\r\nWith that said, let's get started.\r\n\r\nWatching The Long Walk felt precisely as the name suggests: it was a long, tedious, bland and repetitive experience.\r\nIt's the worst kind of bad: It wasn't a movie about an alien spaceship suddenly interrupting the participants and abducting The Major. This would've been a \"worse\" movie, but at least an entertaining *experience*.\r\nInstead, The Long Walk feels mundane, relentlessly trying to achieve a tone of philosophical seriousness and spectacularly, being something more than \"just\" a movie (specifically a \"great\" movie, see below), failing to achieve it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI've structured this review into the four categories I believe make up a \"good movie\": graphics, story, characters (including dialogue) and worldbuilding.\r\nI am specifically not addressing what makes a movie \"great\". A great movie, on top of these four categories, has to educate and elevate. Both of these criteria are not just my opinion, a lot of critics and people working in the scene believe that, too, although they may use different terminology. Feel free to disagree, and let me know if you have a better definition of a \"good\" versus a \"great\" movie.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe graphics were ... okay. As you likely know, the film is live-action (if you’re reading this review, you probably do) and I noticed that the movie uses an anamorphic lens (simple explanation: makes blurry details look oval), which is usually a sign of high-budget filming and professionalism. The colors were pleasant, I didn't find them to be too vivid or too dark. The resolution was also okay, I don't know what the actual resolution was but it didn't *feel* high-res, especially in facial details. However, I only noticed it when I was specifically looking for it, so I'll give the (percieved) resolution a pass.\r\nWhat I did find problematic was the frame rate. The movie had some fast-moving shots close to corn fields in a low frame rate, which made me nauseous, and I normally *never* get anything close to nauseous when watching all kinds of movies.\r\n\r\n\r\nA simple story isn't inherently bad. A movie can excel with a simple story, provided the characters are interesting and well-developed and the worldbuilding is there.\r\nBut I'm not sure how to describe the story of The Long Walk, as there hardly is one. The overarching plot is exactly what the overview suggests: 50 people walking for their lives. What you read is what you get, there's nothing extra, nothing special.\r\nThere are some interesting characters that briefly spice up the story, including our main character Raymond Garraty and his new best friend, Peter McVries, who he meets during the walk. I'll talk more about them in the next part.\r\nWhat was interesting to see, or rather what would've been interesting to see if it didn't fail with the characters and worldbuilding, was Ray's arrival to The Long Walk with his mother and his later reunion with her during the walk. The former was also one of the few instances of worldbuilding in the movie, which I’ll address later.\r\nWhat also really confused me was the timing of the warnings. While some characters got theirs after just seconds of standing still, others could stop for minutes before anything would happen. It took away all immersion (if there was any left, we'll get to that) because it truly felt like the timings were set up to make the movie more dramatic.\r\n\r\n\r\nTalking about the characters is hard, because 75% die after the first day. I will ignore them, because most of them don't contribute anything to the plot. The first day also seemingly only consists of trash talk, which I'm also going to ignore for the most part.\r\n\r\nThe characters in The Long Walk represent a profound missed opportunity. A lot of interesting philosophical and ethical topics are introduced, only for the characters to abruptly abandon them after just a few minutes.\r\n\r\nI'd like to start by talking about the - in my opinion - best-characterized character, Gary Barkovitch.\r\nHe provokes another walker, Rank, into attacking him, leading to Rank’s execution. Not only the characters, but also you as viewer despise him for that. We only later find out that this wasn't actually his intention (?) and he is truly sorry for \"murdering\" Rank. He tries to get back on good terms with the group and shortly after kills himself.\r\nIt's one of the only two instances of character development I could find in the movie. The movie hints at Barkovitch's past, and it’s a shame it doesn’t explore the character more deeply, as the novel does.\r\nBarkovitch's character is thin and his development lacking, but it’s the best the movie offered, and I want to acknowledge that.\r\n\r\nNext, there’s Richard Harkness, the \"nerd\" of the group, and an opposite to Barkovitch. He knows everything about The Long Walk and is participating in hopes of writing a book about it and selling it for profit.\r\nWhat his seemingly large intellect fails to let him realize is that his character's intention don't make any sense. If he doesn't win the walk, he'll die and won't be able to publish his book; if he does, he'll have enough money to not need the book anymore. He's portrayed as a smart character, it makes no sense for him to not have realized this.\r\nFurthermore, when he actually *does* die (because - who would've thought - the main character and his best friend are the last remaining two) his dialogue attempts to hint at some degree of character development (\"I finally understood what The Long Walk is actually about,\" if my memory is correct), which was never shown. His personality remained that of a stereotypical obnoxious nerd throughout the film, until his demise.\r\n\r\nFinally, it’s time to analyze our main character. He'll be the last one I'll talk about, I can't do that anymore.\r\nRay Garraty's wish, if he'll win The Long Walk, is a gun, as he plans to shoot The Major, who killed his dad for spreading \"wrong thoughts and ideas\".\r\nMcVries has to tell him his whole (okay-ish, very generic) backstory, to convince him that love is more important than vengeance. Don't confuse that with character development - Garraty doesn't actually seem to change his stance on the topic. In fact, I'd even call it reverse character development, as it is McVries who wins the race, asks for a gun and shoots The Major. At least it's ... something.\r\nRay's character is one of the only interesting and nuanced ones, as (two) snippets of his backstory are actually shown in the movie. (Yes, only two.) His bond to his mother is one of the few instances I could actually relate to a character. In fact, he actually sees his mother near the end of The Long Walk again, nearly getting all his three warnings, activating his plot armor with some help from McVries and continuing walking right before he's going to be shot. We never see his mother again.\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to keep the worldbuilding part short. Firstly, because there - who would've guessed - barely is any and because I've already wasted enough time with this review.\r\nFirstly, I want to give credit to the start of the movie where there actually was worldbuilding: We could hear some propaganda coming from the radio, hinting at the political situation of the country, and we could see Ray and his mother talking about The Great Walk in the car.\r\nAfter that, there are only three instances of worldbuilding:\r\n\r\n> Ray's dream about his mom\r\n\r\n> The assassination of Ray's father, with the dream scene copy-pasted in front of it.\r\n\r\n> Peter McVries telling Ray about his background and his life until now (it's not even visualized on screen, they're literally just talking).\r\n\r\n \r\nExcept for these, the only thing we ever see is the street where the walk is being held.\r\nWe do not get any other information about the world the movie plays in.\r\nAnd that's a shame.\r\n\r\n\r\nMystery is a valuable thing. But it needs a foundation - a world where these mysteries can live. The Long Walk failed to build that world - and that's my main gripe with it.\r\n\r\nNo, we never learn why The Long Walk got held (beyond the vague reasoning of \"to make the population more productive\").\r\n\r\nNo, we never learn what led the world into its current state.\r\n\r\nNo, we never learn what The Great War was.\r\n\r\nNo, we never learn how the people who watched the walk live on TV even reacted to it.\r\n\r\nNo, we never learn what happened to Collie Parker's wife.\r\n\r\nNo, we never learn what happened to Ray's mother.\r\n\r\nAnd no, we never lean what happens after The Major got assassinated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI can't, in good conscience, recommend this movie to anyone.\r\nAnother review suggested renaming it to \"Roadkill\" and I wholeheartedly agree. This movie is about people being graphically killed for reasons unknown to the viewer, while you wait for something of value to occur. If that doesn't sound interesting to you - please don't watch the movie.\r\nI seriously want my money back, not because of its value to me, but because I don't think Lionsgate deserves it.\r\n\r\nIf you're actually interested in the story the movie tried to tell and the lesson we can learn from it, go read the novel. I read a lot of quotes from the novel while researching for this review, and it truly seems like the story I expected from the movie. Seriously, go read that instead.",

This is, in its own way, also a harsh repudiation of state sanctioned violence. Where the young are brutally sacrificed, by the old, in the pursuit of power and control.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact this film is derived from Stephen Kings work, an author I have mixed feelings about, Id characterize it as an \"instant classic\". Thirty years from now this will be as refresh, remarkable, moving and memorable as it was in 2025. \r\n\r\nWhy? Putting aside the more than excellent, intelligently written script, what makes this essentially very simple film shine is polished, quality acting. A rare thing these days, where candy coated CGI and \"doing stuff\" has taken the place of thoughtful, insightful cinema. The acting from the whole cast is  credit worthy but the leads Cooper Hoffman and David Jonsson, offer up performances that are stark, honestly human, in short, exceptional. \r\n\r\nIn summary, I can't comprehend the negative reviews of this film.

  "content": "Initially, I though this had something of the “Hunger Games” to it, as a group of fifty young men assemble at a military roadblock. It appears they have each won a lottery and a prize of untold riches awaits the winner of a walking competition. The rules are simple. Keep above 3 m.p.h. and don’t stop. “Ray” (Cooper Hoffman) pays an emotion farewell to his mum and joins a group of lads that includes “Pete” (David Jonsson); the somewhat odious “Barkovitch” (Charlie Plummer), talkative “Olson” (Ben Wang) and the lithe and fit looking “Stebbins” (Garrett Wareing) and “Art” (Tut Nyuot). A rousing speech from the “Major” (Mark Hamill) explains the rules to them, and makes clear that it will quite literally be the last man standing who wins. Quickly, “Ray” and “Pete” bond and as they set off, we discover more about what makes these two men tick, interspersed with some lively contributions from their fellow walkers who manage to engage, irritate, offend and motivate as the miles accrue and the numbers dwindle. This takes a fairly intense look at the processes of male bonding and both Hoffman and Jonsson deliver powerfully compelling performances as both characters come to terms with an unpleasant inevitability as hunger and sleep deprivation take their toll. Both Wang and Plummer also deliver unexpectedly charismatic efforts here: a far cry from anything I’ve seen either do before, and though he’s not on screen often, Hamill also manages to exude a degree of malevolent megalomania as this effort to reenergise the not so industrious youth of America travels the country. I felt that it built well to a poignant denouement, but at the moment of truth it rather lost it’s potency and I think it caved in a bit. Still, there is an intensity, a warmth and some vulnerability on show here as both physical and mental endurance are tested to the limits whilst wrapped in a coat of guilt, ambition and increasing inter-reliance. It’s not an easy watch, but as a (less brutal) allegory for so much of modern day, dog-eat-dog life, it works really quite powerfully.",

  "content": "I kept putting off going to see this, I’d heard it was awful but you know what? I didn’t loathe it. Now that’s saying something as from the outset it looked more like the seven dwarves had taken the wrong direction in the forest and found themselves in the wooded equivalent of twee-on-sea! It’s all about a “Smurf” with no name who is pals with “Smurfette” who is helping him go through some ten thousand-odd descriptors for his skills, but none of them seem to fit - especially the clog-making one! He soon finds himself embroiled in a megalomaniac wheeze by the evil sorcerer “Razamel” who is on the look out for a magical book that will enable him to join the league of extraordinary wizards (or something like that) and eradicate “Papa Smurf” and all “Smurfkind”. There now follows lots of “Sorcerer’s Apprentice” type scenes; the obligatory bit of inter-dimensional travel as well as lots of opportunity for Rihanna to belt out the soundtrack that’s clearly had much more creative emphasis put on it than the script - which is not great. It does move along well enough, though, and the story does pick up for about fifteen minutes of dastardliness towards an ending that introduces some magic to the proceedings. The quality of the animation isn’t really much to write home about, with some focus on the lead characters but too many wallpaper ones to make up the numbers in an eerily computerised and sterile fashion. Quite who this is for is interesting. The kids it’s aimed at won’t have a clue who they were, nor are they likely be very engaged by the sheer derivative lack of sophistication of the whole thing. Those of us who remember the annoying blue people and their equally annoying songs from the beginning of the 1980s might want to indulge in some nostalgia for (the last) half an hour, maybe, but otherwise it’s a long old ninety minutes that probably just didn’t need making at all.",

  "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nI've always questioned myself why The Conjuring Universe possesses more spin-offs than main titles since The Conjuring and The Conjuring 2 are, by far, the best films of the popular horror franchise. Looking at the numbers, The Nun holds the box office record, being the most successful movie of the saga financially, but ironically enough, it's also the most disliked film by both critics and audience members. The viral marketing campaign obviously hyped this spin-off to an unbelievable level of expectation, but it's still strange that it took five years to deliver another The Conjuring flick since both previous installments were tremendously profitable as well.\r\n\r\nWith James Wan out of the director's chair and without a screenplay credit, my expectations weren't exactly high. Wan is one of the main reasons why The Conjuring movies work so well. From his ability to generate an enormous amount of suspense to the actually scary atmosphere, Wan is definitely one of the best horror directors of the last decade. Therefore, replacing him would always be a challenging task. Michael Chaves directed The Curse of La Llorona, a generic, bland horror flick that didn't have a single surprising element. However, I did compliment Chaves' work with the horror sequences since I did find them somewhat effective. So, I was still feeling optimistic about The Devil Made Me Do It...\r\n\r\nIt's admittedly the weakest film of the trilogy, but it's still far from the awful Annabelle Comes Home or the hideous origin story about the famous nun. When it comes to the main titles, the exceptional production value is something all have in common. In fact, this latest flick is arguably the best-looking one. The horror sequences look stunning on the big screen, and the sound design is extremely impactful as always. It's worth remembering that this franchise doesn't waste hundreds of millions to make its movies, being a relatively low-budget cinematic universe, especially when compared to every other studio's massive sagas. Practical effects are always the go-to if possible, keeping the use of CGI to the minimum.\r\n\r\nActing-wise, it's also where these films triumph. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga share palpable chemistry, deeply elevating their characters' emotional connection. At its core, The Conjuring features a love story between Ed and Lorraine Warren, ultimately being their grounded, convincing, loving relationship that keeps the viewers interested in the least \"based on a true story\" events. Both actors deliver remarkable performances, as does the legendary John Noble (The Lord of the Rings, Fringe) as a former priest. I didn't know about his casting before the movie, so I was genuinely surprised by seeing Noble on the big screen again. He's absolutely phenomenal, as expected, and quite creepy as a mysterious character.\r\n\r\nEveryone else is decent enough, but I don't find any other interpretation worth noting. Unfortunately, this is as far as I can go compliment-wise. The primary narrative surrounding the actual case that gives the name to the film is nowhere near as interesting as the stories told in the previous The Conjuring movies. The case itself doesn't have much to tell, so the majority of the film rests on following the beloved couple going on side quests as detectives. Eventually, the clues found are connected to the main plot, but overall, David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick's screenplay isn't that captivating. Despite the predictability and formulaic horror elements, there's a rather enjoyable \"twist\" to the whole \"demon possession\" routine that marks the entire franchise.\r\n\r\nThe biggest disappointment is something I feared would happen without James Wan at the helm. The once terrifying, suspenseful atmosphere during the effective, creative jumpscare sequences now gives place to the generic build-up that viewers experience in some of the cheapest horror movies of today. Due to a character's health issue, the tension levels are constantly high for this person in particular, but for most of the runtime, the general environment lacks the essential scary feeling. The jumpscares look lazy and too obvious, a cliche that The Conjuring films fought hard to distance themselves from. In addition to this, it's a much darker movie than the rest in terms of lighting.\r\n\r\nFinally, I have mixed feelings about the ending. Without spoiling it, of course, it's similar to A Quiet Place Part II in the sense that two different sequences need to be edited together seamlessly so the viewers can easily follow what's happening without losing the tension and suspense. One of these scenes is particularly shaky, repetitive, and overly dark, which definitely left me a bit disappointed. Peter Gvozdas and Christian Wagner's editing is really good, though. Michael Burgess' cinematography offers a couple of gorgeous shots, and Joseph Bishara's score maintains the ominous tone of the franchise. James Wan is clearly missed, but Michael Chaves didn't do a bad job.\r\n\r\nThe Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is undoubtedly the weakest installment of the trilogy, but it's still quite far from the awful level of the worst films of the horror franchise. Boasting the trademark terrific production value of the saga, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga deliver outstanding lead performances as the only two emotionally compelling characters. Overall, every element is lesser than the previous The Conjuring movies. From the less scary atmosphere to the unimaginative, generic jumpscares, Michael Chaves isn't able to replicate James Wan's tremendous levels of suspense and tension, despite a brilliant opening sequence. David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick's screenplay focuses on many storylines indirectly connected to the main plot, ending up with a not-that-interesting narrative that doesn't quite justify the main title. Some technical attributes, mainly the editing and cinematography, as well as sound design, compensate with some entertainment. In the end, I still recommend it to fans of the cinematic universe and lovers of the horror genre.\r\n\r\nRating: B-",

It belongs to the genres of religion, crime, horror and drama, and it’s part of the “Conjuring Universe.” The trial of Arne Johnson inspired the movie. The film is not precisely the reproduction of what happened. But we need to remember that it’s a movie, and fiction is mandatory for our entertainment. And the film is engaging. It provides moments of pure adrenaline and pieces of beautiful cinematography and photography. Although it is not perfect, we think it deserves your time because God, daemons and exorcisms, apparently, are with us, believe it or not. Let us explain it to you. - **The Story** - In July 1981, Ed and Lorraine Warren, a couple who specialised in paranormal investigations, were helping the Glatzel. Their eight-year son David was experiencing unexplained and disturbing symptoms, which were consuming David and the whole family. So the Warren decides that it’s time for a real exorcism, and they go to document it.\r\nBut something terrible and unexpected is going to happen, and also the Warren get surprised. In fact, the event degenerates into an escalation of violence, murder, and occult rituals. The case became a worldwide event because, for the first time in history, the defence lawyer brought in front of the court the fact that a demon possessed the killer. Will the lawyer succeed with her defence? What is that Ed and Lorraine are going to prove?And what is your opinion about this surreal but true story? - **Full Analysis at https://www.spotamovie.com/the-conjuring-the-devil-made-me-do-it-2021-movie-review-and-analysis/**",

  "content": "Set in 1932 in Clarksdale, Mississippi, Sinners takes place throughout one night in the middle of October. Sammie Moore (the feature film debut of Miles Caton) is at a crossroads in his life. He is torn between being the son of a preacher and the blues-driven nightlife where he gets to sing, play guitar, and feel alive. Sammie submerges himself in the blues seemingly having little desire to return to his family’s religious roots.\r\n\r\nSammie’s twin cousins Smoke and Stack (both played by Michael B. Jordan) have just returned home after spending seven years in Chicago. With a mobster-like reputation, the twins intend to jumpstart a new jukejoint at an old sawmill previously owned by Klan members. However, they want the grand opening to be that very night, have several arrangements to be made, and have little time to get it all done.\r\n\r\nAs dusk turns to night and the twins’ new club seems to be off to a successful grand opening, an unspeakable evil lurks on their doorstep waiting to be invited in.\r\n\r\nWriter and director Ryan Coogler (Black Panther, Creed) was highly inspired by the works of Robert Rodriguez, so it’s no surprise that Sinners feels like a blacker and more blues-driven version of From Dusk Til Dawn. Sinners is a supernatural action horror film, but it takes its time getting to the horror. The first half of the film is like a well-written gangster film mostly driven by dialogue while introducing a cast of characters that are mostly all worthwhile and entertaining in their ways.\r\n\r\nSmoke and Stack have two extremely different personalities with opposing fates in Sinners, which must have been incredible for Michael B. Jordan. Smoke is more serious and lethal like a soldier while Stack is more eccentric and playful in his demeanor. Smoke also wears blue while Stack wears red. The dual performances allow Jordan to dip his toes into being a hero and a villain, two different types of music, and the dark and the light.\r\n\r\nThis is a vampire film, but it’s also a film about music. Music is the most important aspect of Sinners. The film states that the power of music can heal communities and attract evil. The initial battle between those within the club and the outside dwelling vampires starts as a mostly blacks versus whites standoff but evolves into something much more elaborate.\r\n\r\nLike all Ryan Coogler films, Sinners is extremely black-centric but the film also incorporates several different nationalities in a period when whites thought they were the only decent race. The grocery store owners are Chinese, a biracial girl follows Stack from the north back down to the south, and Remmick (Jack O’Connell), the lead vampire, is introduced being chased by Native Americans. The African aspects allow for a deeper appreciation for the film’s stellar score and put much-needed rejuvenation to the cinematic vampire.\r\n\r\nSinners is also a clashing of music genres with the human characters strumming on the blues side of things while the vampires and outsiders lean into Irish folk music and jig dancing. There is this jaw-dropping sequence within the wooden walls of Club Juke when Sammie finally gets to show how talented he is as a musician. It showcases all types of music, classic and contemporary, that have essentially evolved from or been inspired by gutbucket blues (blues or jazz music featuring raw emotions and a gritty, soulful sound).\r\n\r\nVampire folklore is toyed with in a way that is incredibly satisfying in Sinners. The concept of being invited in is something the film approaches extremely well. Music is utilized by both sides to either attempt to keep the living together and safe or to lure them outside to become part of a red-eyed, bloodthirsty pack of undead. There’s the typical lore you expect in a vampire film like trying to use garlic to fend them off and making wooden stakes to drive through their hearts.\r\n\r\nBut in other vampire films if you kill the head vampire it can either cure those that have been changed or kill all of them. Sinners takes a different route stating that each vampire has to be killed regardless on if their leader is slain. Hoodoo also plays a major part in the film. Wunmi Mosaku (His House, Deadpool & Wolverine) portrays Annie. Annie has an emotional connection to Smoke, but she also practices hoodoo, which allows her to be the voice of reason when bodies start piling up.\r\n\r\nSinners is one of the horniest films to come out of the first part of the year. Films have kind of shied away from showcasing nudity and sex with recent films. Everyone in Sinners is bursting with lust and when they’re not in the middle of copulating or performing cunnilingus or fellatio they’re talking about it in graphic detail.\r\n\r\nSinners is a scary, hilarious, and gloriously horny bloodbath with one hell of a bluesy score. An instant, masterful, and exceptional horror classic that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen possible.",

  "content": "It’s always gratifying to see a filmmaker take a big step up in his or her career, and that’s precisely what writer-director Ryan Coogler has done in his latest offering, a project that reflects a significant jump in the depth, artistry and sophistication of his creative output. Coming on the heels of his successes in “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” (2022), “Creed” (2015) and “Fruitvale Station” (2013), Coogler has hit a home run with this period piece smart horror story about identical twin brothers (both played by Michael B. Jordan) who return to their Mississippi home in 1932 after years of working for Al Capone in Chicago, where they made huge money that they now plan to use to open their own juke joint in a converted sawmill. It’s an opportunity where they hope to make even bigger bucks while helping to promote their talented cousin, Sammie (Miles Caton), a blues musician who’s a killer guitarist and vocalist. But, as this ambitious trio launches this effort, they’re confronted with a variety of challenges, including ghosts from their past, the perils of deeply ingrained social prejudice, the dual-edged sword posed by creative and financial success, and, most menacingly, mystical forces that may be more than they’re capable of handling. These narrative components combine to tell a captivating tale about a troubled time in the country’s history, one made all the more ominous with the appearance of supernatural powers that simultaneously offer both potential promise and the prospects of tremendous evil taking root. In bringing this picture to life, the filmmaker has served up an entertaining and engaging offering, one replete with fine performances, superb production values, sharp-edged, perfectly timed comic relief, truly inventive, deftly orchestrated cinematography, and suitably restrained (graphic though not gratuitous) imagery. Admittedly, the screenplay could use some work in a few spots (most notably with tighter writing and clearer plot elaboration), but it also manages to successfully fuse the inherent nature of several genres, including drama, dark humor and smart horror, while also presenting a wealth of insights in an array of areas. Through this picture, it’s easy to see how Coogler has appreciably upped his game as a filmmaker, one that bodes well for his future in the field. It indeed represents the revelation of a talent more profound than anyone has previously recognized or properly acknowledged. “Sinners” is a work that deserves to be remembered come awards season later this year. Let’s hope that it is.",

  "content": "<em>'Sinners'</em> is a fair load of fun. It admittedly didn't fully knock my socks off, but there isn't any doubt that it is a very good film. It's stylish with impressive music and visuals, whilst all of the acting talent give good performances. It's paced astutely too.\r\n\r\nMichael B. Jordan is as entertaining as he usually tends to be, I do like seeing him act. The dual role is done well here, the 'split screen' is solid but my brain sillily - no matter the movie or standard of how they portray the same actor twice - simply cannot interpret the effect as seamless.\r\n\r\nJack O'Connell stands out behind Jordan, particularly for the moments of sing. Hailee Steinfeld and Wunmi Mosaku are the others that I took notice of too, same can be said for Delroy Lindo, Li Jun Li and Omar Miller; I oddly always think of <em>'American Pie Presents: Band Camp'</em> with the latter (I'm so sorry, Omar).\r\n\r\nI must say, the trailers revealed too much. I tend to avoid those so assume I didn't get the full brunt of it anyway, though even so I remember catching a couple of bits that don't occur until the gritty part of the movie. It's no biggie, trailers are designed to get bums on seats after all.",

The film is well-acted (Delroy Lindo was the standout) and it was definitely worth seeing in the theatre. \r\n\r\nMy only complaints are that the ending felt rushed, there are a couple of oddly out of place surrealist sequences, and the villain was weak. It's a fairly long film already, but I think it would have been better if we'd gotten to see another 10 minutes of the interaction between the villain and his initial pursuers, and a few flashbacks would have been helpful. \r\n\r\nI also think this story would have worked better as a TV series, but still, a very original and enjoyable film. It reminded me a fair bit of the first season of Interview with a Vampire.",

  "content": "Sinners started off similar to a gritty drama in the Deep South, every character felt so built and I was fully invested.  Then the vampire elements started twirling in. That first fade into the moon, the guitar riff, unbelievably hard Mr. Coogler. It gave a feeling I haven’t felt since watching dune 2. Oh and the scene where we go through the history and future of music, best scene of the decade maybe? That juke joint was heaven for clarksville that night, a place where people could finally let loose and forget about all their work to enjoy powerful music, rooted in their ancestry. I ascended to heaven, and I’m not coming back down.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder here is a review I wrote in a discord server you don’t need to read it it’s pretty basic:\r\n\r\n\r\nSinners is the new film from Ryan Coogler, and his first fully original story. This movie just proves how awesome and competent of a director Ryan Coogler is. This movie expertly genre blends drama with horror, which all encompasses the theme of black ownership, music, and religion. \r\n\r\nSinners is one of the best new movies I’ve seen this decade. The cinematography (which I luckily saw in 70mm IMAX) was so beautiful and had chills every time the frame would expand to show off a landscape, and breathtaking sunsets and sunrises. Sometimes the frame would transition from a haunting 🤫 to a beautiful moonlight which was backed by the 10/10 musical score. I will mention more later.\r\n\r\nBTW this movie has one of the BEST SEQUENCES that will make you ASCEND IN YOUR SEAT. Jaw was dropped. It’s not even a horror sequence.\r\n\r\nThe horror elements are so well used in this movie, it’s like kissing somebody and you get a tingle everywhere when something awesome happens. Everything is so badass and goes hard. The action made me shake for the whole 3rd act, it ruled. The end got very emotional too. So so so freaking perfect. See this in a theater.\r\n\r\nOh yeah the score. THE GUITAR SHREDDING AT THE BEST TIMES OHOOHOHOHOOH\r\n\r\n10/10",

  "content": "Michael B. Jordan is “Smoke” and twin brother “Stack” in this classy drama of a pair who’ve lived on the wrong side of the tracks for most of their lives, but have determined to go home and try to go straight. To that end, they buy an old barn and hope to set up their own speakeasy - with only a nominal nod to prohibition - pumping to the rafters with dancing and blues music. On the way, they ally with talented musician “Sammie” (Miles Caton) and, of course, there’s a bit of baggage for the siblings as they return to a town that’s not altogether welcoming. Once home, a mixture of confidence, threats and collective charisma succeeds in assembling a crowd for their opening night. Pretty swiftly, though, that grand celebration attracts the attention of some travellers who are keen to join the party, but perhaps in true Charlie Daniels style, they have an altogether more menacing agenda. This is the cinematic equivalent of an LP, this film. It starts with one side gradually introducing us a rich collection of characters all of whom could quite plausibly have lived in Mississippi at a time when segregation was as rife as illicit booze, and the two more recently hailing from Chicago gives things a certain gangster element too. There is also a very subtly powerful effort from Hailee Steinfield as “Mary” too. The flip side of the record proceeds to develop some elements of peril with the story, and that’s where it rather runs out of steam for me. It tries very hard to create a sense of hot, sweaty and frenzied jeopardy, but maybe because it has already taken quite a long time to get to this stage, that all comes across as a bit rushed and lacking in punch. It looks great, the visual effects are convincing enough and the production design smoulders perfectly. In the end, though, whilst it proves that MBJ is comfortably able to hold a story, Ryan Coogler has overly relied on a marvellously toe-tapping musical score that has been left to do much of the heavy lifting. That latter point is made more essential by a mediocre audio mix that can make the dialogue quite difficult to make out more often than I’d have liked. This seems to be an increasing issue as directors become more ambitious with their visual aspirations leaving the one thing that cannot be readily faked/augmented - the sound - left at the altar. It’s a cinema film, and will look distinctly average on a television so big screen and soundtrack audio is essential to get the best from this silky looking story with an interesting twist at the end, and again at the very end.",

  "content": "Sinners (2025) – A Spiritual, Sonic, Soul-Shaking Masterpiece\r\n\r\nThere are films that claim to echo with heart, with history, with heritage—and then there is \"Sinners,\" Ryan Coogler’s audacious, transcendent blend of Gothic folklore, musical soulcraft, and cultural reclamation. It doesn’t just echo. It sings. It howls. It bleeds. From its first frame to its devastating final image, Sinners is a full-bodied spiritual experience masquerading as horror—a rare, roaring anomaly that doesn’t fit inside a genre but redefines what cinema can be when it chooses truth over trope.\r\n\r\nAt the centre of this cinematic exorcism is music—not as adornment, but as DNA. The film’s heartbeat is the blues. And it is through that heartbeat that Coogler tells a tale steeped in generational trauma, Black identity, post-war brotherhood, the spectral weight of history, and the enduring fight for Black ownership in the face of cultural erasure. But unlike anything we've seen before, Sinners fuses those themes with a chilling yet poetic vampire mythos that feels entirely earned, never performative. It is horror, yes—but elevated horror. Arthouse. Operatic. Biblical.\r\n\r\nThe Blues as Bloodline\r\n\r\nSet in the Mississippi Delta during the 1930s, Sinners follows twin brothers Smoke and Stack—both played, exquisitely and with startling distinction, by Michael B. Jordan—who return home to open a juke joint. This place, more than a bar, becomes a church of sorts: a sanctuary of soul, a communal hearthstone where Black folk gather to drink, dance, and reclaim their joy. The walls of the juke joint hum with possibility. With danger. With prophecy. Even if only for one night.\r\n\r\nAnd then there’s the moment. The moment that marks \"Sinners\" not just as a great film, but a holy text of black magic. Sammie, the film’s humble preacher-boy turned guitar savant, takes to the stage. He plays the blues—slow, aching, ancestral. As he sings, the camera glides across the dance floor in a long, liquid motion, capturing the swelling ecstasy of Black joy. And then the music begins to evolve. It morphs, imperceptibly at first, weaving through the history of Black music—African tribal chants, gospel, jazz, funk, soul, R&B, hip-hop—all spiralling into the foundation laid by the blues. It's not a medley; it’s a resurrection. An invocation. This is music as invocation. And in that moment, it summons something darker.\r\n\r\nOutside the joint, stands the vampire Remmick, captivated by the sounds, eyes glowing like embers, face lit with a deranged smile. He listens intently, staring into the soul of their cultural history as the place is set spiritually ablaze. Sammie's music called to something ancient. Something seductive. Something that knows the blues because it was born of the same sorrow.\r\n\r\nA Clash of Cultures—Scored to Perfection\r\n\r\nWhat Coogler and composer Ludwig Göransson achieve with the film’s score is revolutionary. The music is not just thematic; it is political. It is narrative. When the scenes pulse with Black culture, the music leans blues, jazz, rhythm. But when Remmick and his fellowship—white vampires born of pain and craving—invade, the score rips into metal, into noise. The clash is jarring. Purposeful. It feels like an act of war. The blues is not just an aesthetic—it’s a battlefield. And the music becomes the weapon, the shield, and the lament.\r\n\r\nThe result is a full-body experience. As Remmick’s power grows, the music becomes louder, more aggressive, less familiar. It’s a stunning metaphor: Black culture, as it always has, being appropriated, corrupted, and consumed until it’s unrecognisable to those who birthed it. And yet, it fights back. Every scene feels like a spiritual wrestling match, waged through melody and rhythm.\r\n\r\nRemmick: The Devil At The Door\r\n\r\nJack O’Connell gives a performance so disturbingly charismatic you almost want to follow him into the dark and join his fellowship. Remmick isn’t just a villain—he’s a prophet of perversion.\r\n\r\nA being who believes, earnestly, that he is liberating the people he turns. He doesn’t kill for sport; he offers salvation through eternal night. He doesn’t deny his love for Black culture—he craves it. He worships it. He believes the blues is a divine language, one that called him into existence. His monologues are lyrical and damning, his gaze never cruel, always convincing. You don’t root for him. But you understand why someone would.\r\n\r\nOne scene in particular—outside the joint, where he sings “Picked Poor Robin Clean” in the dark with his newly-turned—should be studied. It is eerily beautiful, the harmony between vampire and victim pitch-perfect, terrifying. When he and his hive recite the Lord’s Prayer in unison with Sammie, the lines between the sacred and the profane dissolve entirely. It’s religious horror at its most potent—unflinching, unforgettable.\r\n\r\nBrothers in Arms, Brothers in Grief\r\n\r\nJordan’s dual performance as Smoke and Stack is nothing short of masterful. Stack is lighter, a dreamer. Smoke is war-weathered, clenched, sceptical. But together, they form a complete man—until tragedy forces one to stand alone. There’s a small scene near the end that shattered me more than any of the horror sequences. Smoke, shaking, tries to roll a cigarette for himself, something Stack always did for him. He fails. His hands tremble. A moment so small, yet so laden with grief, PTSD, and love that it lingers long after the credits roll. Coogler knows the power of silence. Of memory. Of unspoken bonds. And I appreciate the care that went into making sure a detail so seemingly small, was given a fitting final detail, that reassured me of the passion that went into every single god damn scene.\r\n\r\nThe Voice That Summoned the Storm\r\n\r\nMiles Caton’s debut as Sammie Moore doesn’t just mark the arrival of a new talent—it announces a generational voice. At just 20, Caton steps into the role of the preacher’s son with a presence that feels both timeless and urgent. His musical roots run deep—raised in a gospel-rich family, he’s been singing since the age of three, and his voice carries that lineage with soulful weight.\r\n\r\nCaton not only sings in Sinners but co-wrote the haunting original track “Last Time (I Seen the Sun)” with Alice Smith and composer Ludwig Göransson. Learning blues guitar in just two months for the role, his performance in the juke joint sequence is a revelation—channeling pain, power, and prophecy in equal measure. It’s no wonder director Ryan Coogler described him as “a once-in-a-lifetime voice.” Caton’s portrayal of Sammie is the film’s heartbeat—a blend of innocence and depth that lingers long after the credits roll.\r\n\r\nFraming the Fire\r\n\r\nAutumn Durald Arkapaw’s cinematography in Sinners is nothing short of masterful. Making history as the first female cinematographer to shoot on large-format IMAX film, she crafts a visual narrative that is both expansive and intimate. Utilizing a blend of IMAX and Ultra Panavision 70 formats, the film’s shifting aspect ratios serve the story’s emotional beats—widening to capture the vastness of the Mississippi Delta, then narrowing to draw us into the characters’ inner worlds.\r\n\r\nNight scenes glow with a haunting luminescence, firelight dances with purpose, and each frame feels meticulously composed yet organically alive. Arkapaw’s lens doesn’t just show us the world of Sinners—it immerses us in its soul, making the supernatural elements feel grounded and the historical context visceral. Her work elevates the film, turning each scene into a painting that breathes.\r\n\r\nAnchors in the Storm\r\n\r\nDelroy Lindo's performance is like jazz—unpredictable, soulful, and necessary. He doesn't undercut the film's tension, but rather gives it breath. In a narrative that leans heavy on atmosphere and myth, he injects a kind of familial levity that feels earned and lived-in. His presence is grounding, a reminder of what’s at stake when the horror threatens to strip the story of its humanity. And then there’s Hailee Steinfeld, as Mary, bringing a layered grace to the screen—mischievous, magnetic, and caught between identities. Raised with Smoke and Stack, her loyalty runs deep, but her character exists in a space that blurs lines—between belonging and otherness, tradition and disruption. There's a quiet poetry to how her arc unfolds, and you’re left wondering whether she’s a reflection of what it means to straddle cultures, or a symbol of something even more elusive. Either way, she leaves a mark—fierce and unforgettable. And then there's Wunmi Mosaku’s portrayal of Annie, which anchors the film with a quiet yet potent strength. She is a bridge to ancestral wisdom, embodying the resilience and spiritual power of the Black community. Her presence is not loud, but her influence is undeniable—rooted in healing and protection, offering a steady counterpoint to the chaos around her. Annie doesn’t just fight evil with wisdom—she fights to preserve the very soul of her people.\r\n\r\nThis soul isn't for sale\r\n\r\nAnd in a film layered with metaphor and meaning, black ownership doesn’t just echo—it resounds. It's not a theme that visits—it’s the architecture. And Sammie becomes the embodiment of that principle. His music, his soul, his presence—they’re not just narrative devices, they’re battlegrounds. There’s a moment—powerful, worded like an offer but weighted like a threat—where what’s being asked isn’t blood or vengeance, but ownership of that brilliance. Remmick offers everybody else their lives if they let him take Sammie, but Slim responds \"he's ours.\" It’s not a loud moment. But it cuts deep. And it’s in the refusal—in the stillness of collective resistance—that the film finds one of its most potent truths. That cultural power isn’t just about legacy—it’s about protection, unity, and the refusal to be harvested.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Oscars\r\n\r\nThere are films designed to win Oscars. And then there are films like Sinners—films that make awards feel meaningless. Because what do statues mean when you’ve built a monument? Sinners is that monument. To music. To Blackness. To art. To survival. To Cinema. It doesn’t just earn your praise. It earns your soul.\r\n\r\nIn a world where genre cinema often feels disposable, Sinners is an inheritance. A film made by people who love the culture deeply enough to protect it, critique it, and immortalise it. It is horror not just of the supernatural, but of history, of identity, of being seen and erased all at once.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, it is joyous. It is poetic. It is epic. It is... unforgettable.",

  "content": "<em>'A Working Man'</em> is imperfectly very good. I do have a couple of issues with it, but all in all I have to say that I did enjoy this to a fairly strong degree. Jason Statham seldom disappoints in an action thriller, I'm a fan of his so was always likely to get the required fun out of this.\r\n\r\nStatham is great, naturally without him the movie would be vastly less entertaining. Away from the former British diver (still can't quite believe that's the same guy!), there are too many characters - which is one of the issues I have. There didn't need to be so many peeps in this.\r\n\r\nEven so, those onscreen are all decent enough and none register as overt negatives in my mind. David Harbour does well in a small role, he usually speaks the same way in roles but this feels minorly different. Michael Peña and Arianna Rivas are solid, as is Jason Flemyng.\r\n\r\nThe latter's character should've be the only bad guy in this, or at least one of a few. He gives enough that we didn't need anyone else in my opinion, especially as 'higher-ups' Andrej Kaminsky and Maximilian Osinski give weaker performances. Chidi Ajufo is the best of the rest.\r\n\r\nMy other issue lies with the run time. I guess with so many characters it did need to be almost two hours in length, however you could've told this story within 90 minutes without a doubt. But again, as noticeable as that and the other issue is, it at least doesn't hinder much for me.",

  "content": "On paper, director David Ayer‘s revenge action thriller “A Working Man” should be a slam dunk for Jason Statham. Based on Chuck Dixon’s novel “Levon’s Trade,” it has all the familiar elements that not only cater to the actor’s strengths, but also to the desires of his most die hard fans. Unfortunately, very little about the film works, and it comes across as dull, predictable, and unmemorable.\r\n\r\nLevon (Statham) is a former black ops solider turned construction worker who is forced to return to his lethal past when his boss’s daughter (Arianna Rivas) is abducted by human traffickers. What starts as a rescue mission soon unravels a deeper web of corruption, pushing Levon to do what he does best: take down bad guys with ruthless efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe premise is well-worn but serviceable, but never quite rises above its own mediocrity. The stunt work is strong and the fights are bloody, but the action sequences mostly lack the punch and creativity needed to garner any feelings of excitement. The action is middling, which makes the uninspired story stand out in the worst way.\r\n\r\nEven worse, the film lacks personality. It’s competently made but painfully generic, with a by-the-numbers plot that fails to generate any real emotional stakes. The script (co-written by Ayer and Sylvester Stallone) doesn’t do enough to elevate the material beyond standard action fare.\r\n\r\nDespite being well cast, the film wastes a terrific supporting turn from David Harbour, and it feels like the reliable tough guy Statham is running on autopilot. Nobody enjoys watching a movie where the lead actor is delivering a performance that feels more like a contractual obligation than a passion project.\r\n\r\nWorking in harmony with Ayer’s directorial style, Shawn White’s cinematography proves to be the brightest spot. This is a polished, good looking action thriller, at least visually speaking.\r\n\r\nIf I had to sum up “A Working Man” in one word, it would be “serviceable.” This is a film that will be buried under Statham’s long list of similar (and much better) movies.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

  "content": "Well if you just thought Jason Statham was going to make a movie about the dangers of the construction industry then the first few scenes will put you straight and give a clue that his past is altogether more violent. That is going to come in handy when the daughter of his boss is kidnapped-to-order by some people traffickers and he is, initially reluctantly, drafted into track her down. With consummate ease, he sets about his task facing down some of the menacing Russian brotherhood who rule the roost supplying girls, drugs and booze to whoever can afford to pay! Can he find the girl? Will the sun come up? There’s not the slightest hint of jeopardy to any of this derivative outing for a star whose usual charisma has been left in his Winnebago. It’s got bits of “Die Hard” (1988) mixed in with, I thought, that Clint Eastwood “Cry Macho” (2021) affair plus the seriously camped up pairing of Jason Flemyng and Maximilian Osinski to make sure that any scintilla of credibility was well and truly throttled after about fifteen minutes of this repetitive and predictable drama. Sylvester Stallone had an hand in the writing - I suppose someone had to put the full stops in the script, and David Ayer shows little, is any, flair as the thing lumbers along for what seems like a lot longer than two hours. Let’s hope Jace isn’t going down the Bruce Willis boulevard of broken dreams here, and doesn’t make any more duds like this.",

  "content": "The wizards at Pixar have crafted a new gem with “Inside Out 2” which is a rare achievement in that it is a sequel that outdoes the original film.\r\n\r\nThe movie opens with Riley (Kensington Tallman), just after her 13th Birthday as Joy (Amy Poehler) recaps her accomplishments and sets the stage for her big Hockey Game with her friends Grace (Grace Lu) and Bree (Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green).\r\n\r\nTheir success on the ice attracts the attention of the coach of the local Firebirds who invites the trio to a three-day camp which will set the stage for them to be included on the team as freshmen.\r\n\r\nThings take a turn when a Puberty alarm goes off followed by a construction crew to upgrade the console. Fear (Tony Hale), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Liza Lapira), and Sadness (Phyllis Smith),  do not react well to this and the arrival of the new emotions Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Ennui  (Adèle Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Paul Walter-Hauser), sets the stage for new conflicts.\r\n\r\nRiley arrives at camp and becomes enchanted with the popular girls who are fronted by Valentina (Lilimar), and Riley excludes her friends as a chance to be part of the in-crowd.\r\n\r\nThe new emotions set a course to keep Riley safe from her potential future issues and banish the old emotions that they view as hindering Riley and setting a path for future failure.\r\n\r\nForced to travel to the furthest reaches of Riley’s mind to recover something of necessity; the old emotions hope to undo the damage being done and restore Riley who is in the turmoil of being a teen and hampered by the flood of new and often conflicting emotions and circumstances that she encounters.\r\n\r\nThe movie is filled with charm and humor as well as presenting an honest look at the changes and pressures that children face during their teen years and does so without being heavy-handed. The emotions new and old are great and there are many moments throughout the film that will bring laughter as well as nostalgia for adults; especially those with children who are about to enter their Teen years.\r\n\r\nThe film is moving and there were more than a few eyes welling up near the end of the film during our screening as Pixar has once again crafted an enjoyable and relatable tale that can be enjoyed by the entire family.\r\n\r\n4.5 stars out of 5.",

  "content": "I really quite enjoyed the first of these (2015) but I struggled a bit to stay engaged with the one. \"Riley\" is still happily coasting through family life until one day, she embarks on the yellow brick road that is puberty. Towit, her control gallery is no longer the purview of just her lifelong guides like \"Fear\", \"Joy\" and \"Anger\" - now she has also to deal with the likes of disgust, envy, boredom and worst of all - anxiety. It's maybe the latter that the film should be called as we now embark on quite a humourless swipe at the culture of validation that young people must navigate. It's all about being popular. Being liked. Being the best - in the ice hockey team. Old loyalties go under the bus in favour of new aspirations and yes, much of it does ring quite true as an evaluation of the fickleness in all of us. Thing is, though, there's just too much inevitability about what comes next and there's way too much incessant dialogue. \"Anger\" has some fun along the way, and there is the odd comedy one-liner from the laconic \"Ennui\" but it just didn't resonate with me at all. The animation is standard Pixar fayre that does the job colourfully but unremarkably, and by the conclusion I was hoping there was an off button on that great big console. Yep - I'm probably too old to really appreciate this the way the kids can, but the trick for these studios has to be to engage the adults at the same time as the weans, else out come the mobile phones as our own version of ennui sets in. It's fine, but forgettable, sorry.",

  "content": "Poor Pixar! They just haven't been able to catch a break this decade! Having a majority of their originals dumbed on Disney+, Lightyear flopping, and Elemental just barely managing to make a comeback after having the studio's worst opening yet. They just can't catch a break, specially with Disney laying off their animators and refusing to let them make any originals anymore. Safe to say, they've had it rough! But Inside Out 2, despite many things working against it actually managed to be good, in fact great! Almost as good as its predecessor. I'm not gonna fully say it's a masterpiece like any of their older films, or even films like Soul or the first Inside Out, but it's still a pretty great movie! A movie that honors the original while adding to the original's themes. Instead of just being the first movie again, they actually do things a little different, by adding new emotions, covering the themes of puberty and anxiety, and adding some new locations. I also like how they don't just reset Joy back to the way she was in movie 1, they actually stick to her character development, letting the others help her, especially Sadness, and being open to new ideas. She's still flawed, of course, but it's more still growing as a character rather than just learning the same lesson again. They even subvert the originals message. Inside Out 1: it's okay to not be happy. Inside Out 2: It's okay to let happiness in. You are valued and you are good enough. There's also one scene in the movie : the panic attack. I won't spoil what happens but I really love how this scene played out. Altogether, a pretty solid film that builds on the original ti the point where I'd actually say I'd be open for a 3rd movie, something I thought I'd never, ever say ever!!! Congrats, Pix! U made a good sequel, keep it up!\r\n\r\n           TOTAL SCORE: 8.5/10",

  "content": "When I first heard about the sequel to Inside Out, I approached it with a mix of excitement and apprehension. The original film is a masterpiece, one of Pixar’s finest achievements, seamlessly blending humor, emotion, and a profound understanding of human psychology. Given Pixar’s recent uneven track record, I feared that the sequel might not live up to the high standards set by its predecessor. However, I am delighted to report that isn't the case here.\r\n\r\nI can confidently say that Inside Out 2 is a worthy successor to the original. It almost reaches the same level of excellence, taking the story in a fresh direction with a new cast of characters that enrich the narrative.\r\n\r\nThe sequel introduces a beautifully nuanced character: Anxiety, portrayed by Maya Hawke. Hawke’s performance brings a sympathetic depth to the role, making Anxiety a character that audiences can relate to and care for. The character adds a layer of complexity to the story that resonates on multiple levels. Anxiety's interactions with Joy, played masterfully once again by Amy Poehler, highlight the inevitable struggles of growing up. Poehler’s Joy continues to be the heart of the film.\r\n\r\nThe story’s emotional core remains as powerful as ever. As a father, the original film spoke to me deeply about understanding and acknowledging my children's emotions all by extension. This sequel shifts the focus inward, reflecting the internal emotional landscape of adolescence and early adulthood. Riley, our protagonist, is growing up, and the introduction of more complex emotions reflects the reality of her development. The film brilliantly captures the awkwardness and discomfort of this transition, making it relatable for both younger audiences and adults.\r\n\r\nSome interactions in the film are cringe-worthy because they are so true to life. We've all experienced moments of anxiety and self-doubt, and seeing them portrayed so authentically on screen is both uncomfortable and cathartic. \r\n\r\nAmy Poehler's portrayal of Joy remains a highlight, and Maya Hawke’s Anxiety is a beautifully crafted antagonist who evolves throughout the film. By the end, Anxiety isn’t just a source of conflict but a character that facilitates growth and understanding. This development adds depth to the narrative, making it more than just a children’s film but a profound exploration of emotional growth.\r\n\r\nInside Out 2 is a summer movie that stands as a high point for family entertainment. It balances humor and emotion with a storyline that speaks to both children and adults. Pixar has once again delivered a film that not only entertains but also enlightens, reminding us of the importance of understanding and embracing all our emotions. For anyone who loved the first film, this sequel is a must-watch, capturing the same magic while exploring new emotional territory.\r\n\r\nIf you cherished the original for its insightful portrayal of emotions, you will find Inside Out 2 a worthy and enriching continuation of Riley’s journey. It’s a film that promises to be both a hit with families and a valuable conversation starter about the complex world of emotions.",

The return of our beloved emotions—Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust—offers a delightful reunion while introducing new emotional characters that reflect the evolving complexity of Riley's inner world. Each emotion is beautifully voiced, bringing authenticity and depth to their characters. Amy Poehler’s Joy and Phyllis Smith’s Sadness once again shine, their dynamic evolving in ways that are both surprising and deeply moving.",

Both animation and voice acting are great, and the animation properly shows the confusion and disorder of a teenage girl’s mind. Compared to ‘Toy Story 2,’ it may not be as rich in genuine sentiment, but it returns all viewers, children, and adults, to the challenge of the act of growing up.\r\n\r\nI also enjoyed the comedy and the themes present in it and maybe because of the continuous showings or better comprehension of it allowed me to have less of a feeling compare to the first one although at some parts it is sort of teary. It was interesting to see how Joy and Anxiety interacted with each other these characters are more real in terms of showing us how emotions work during decision-making when you’re in trouble.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoyed my experience, check out the <a href=\"https://moviepoptime.com/drama/inside-out-2/\" target=\"_blank\">Latest Movie Reviews</a>.",

  "content": "The Godfather Review by Al Carlson\r\n\r\nThe Godfather is a film considered by most to be one of the greatest ever made. From The American Film Institute to as voted by users on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) it is consider to be one of the best. As a film that ranks as high as other masterpieces including Citizen Kane, Pulp Fiction and 12 Angry Men, The Godfather is an exceptional piece of cinema excellence that is flawless and is simply the pinnacle crime drama.\r\nThe Godfather revolves around the Corleone’s, an Italian family with deep roots in the New York City mafia. The head of the Corleone’s is Don Vito Corleone, a man who takes care of his family and demands respect in return. His son Michael however, who just returned home from World War II, doesn’t want to become involved with the family business. The Sollozzo’s, a family of drug dealers, confront Don and request protection in exchange for profits from the Sollozzo’s drug sales. But Don declines the offer, for he is against selling narcotics. The rejected offer starts what turns into an all out mafia war between the two families with Michael diving deep into the mafia lifestyle.\r\nThe characters are portrayed by a legendary all-star cast including Marlon Brando as Don, Al Pacino as his son Michael and James Caan as Don’s oldest son Sonny. The casting for this film has been considered by many to be the best casted film in history for their astonishing performances. All three main actors were nominated for an academy award, but only Marlon Brando won an Oscar for best actor in a leading role. It’s fascinating to watch how these characters change over the course of the movie, with one in particular changing drastically.\r\nDirecter Francis Ford Coppola, being raised in an Italian-American family in New York, understood Italian culture exceptionally and made the film very authentically. Everything from the wedding dances to the cuisine to the terms used by the characters in Sicilian come from Coppola’s first-hand knowledge of Italian-American culture. Italian composer Nino Rota did an outstanding job making the soundtrack for the film, despite not getting the Oscar for best music (but he did win an Oscar for his work in the sequel, The Godfather: Part II). Virtually everyone recognizes that iconic trumpet solo once it starts playing. He also wrote the score for another great Italian film 8 1/2. \r\nThis film should be immediately followed up by it’s sequel, The Godfather: Part II, which also won best picture. The series still holds the title of most best picture awards for a film series to this day. They’re both flawless crime dramas and have earned their titles as some of the best pieces of cinema ever. I will guarantee you won’t be able to see this film only once, as it gets better after continual viewings. There is really nothing more to add other than if you haven’t seen this movie yet, it’s about time you did. The Godfather is a movie you can’t refuse.",

The characterisations are layered and colourful; Diane Keaton has no idea what she's getting herself into! John Cazale is great as the spineless brother \"Fredo\" too. Once again, Nino Rota pulls out all the stops to give this a score that helps cement this film's place as amongst the best ever made. My only criticism, and it is slight at that, is that the audio mix could have done with a bit of a boost. Much of the dialogue - especially from Brando - verges on the inaudible at times.",

  "content": "The Godfather (1972), directed by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola, is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece that redefined storytelling in film. Based on Mario Puzo’s bestselling novel, the movie seamlessly blends crime drama with an epic exploration of power, loyalty, and family. Every frame is a testament to Coppola’s brilliance, as he transforms a gripping tale into a timeless work of art.\r\n\r\nAt the center of this monumental film is Marlon Brando’s unforgettable performance as Vito Corleone. Brando masterfully embodies the aging patriarch with an aura of quiet menace and profound wisdom, earning him a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Actor. Al Pacino delivers a career-defining performance as Michael Corleone, evolving from a reluctant outsider to a ruthless leader in a chilling, yet utterly believable transformation. James Caan as the fiery Sonny Corleone and Robert Duvall as the cool-headed consigliere Tom Hagen also shine, each adding complexity and depth to their roles.\r\n\r\nCoppola’s direction is nothing short of visionary. His ability to craft an intricate narrative while maintaining a deliberate pace allows the characters and themes to breathe. The cinematography by Gordon Willis, often referred to as the “Prince of Darkness,” enhances the film’s iconic look, using shadows and warm tones to convey a sense of both intimacy and foreboding. Nino Rota’s haunting score, particularly the famous Godfather Waltz, further elevates the film into legend.\r\n\r\nA fun fact: The studio initially resisted casting Marlon Brando, who was considered difficult to work with at the time. Coppola had to fight for him and famously convinced the studio by showing a test reel of Brando stuffing his cheeks with cotton balls to transform into the iconic Don Vito Corleone. The rest, as they say, is history.\r\n\r\nThe Godfather isn’t just a movie—it’s an experience. It’s a study of power and morality, a family saga, and a crime thriller all rolled into one. Its influence on filmmaking is immeasurable, and its performances, direction, and storytelling remain unparalleled. This is a film that stands the test of time, and for good reason: it’s a masterpiece in every sense of the word.",

  "content": "I watched this for about half an hour before I twigged that “Totone” (Clément Faveau) was Prince Harry’s stunt double! I though the resemblance was uncanny. He is an eighteen year old who works in his dad’s fromagerie when he’s not out on the razz. His dad also likes a glass or two, is lousy at karaoke and not much better at driving, and it’s this toxic combination that leaves the young man having to look after his seven year old sister and grow up pretty swiftly. Knowing as much about cheese making as I do, he is forced to takes a job at a rival farm and that’s where he, and we, discover just his hard it is to make the stuff. Did you know they have to heat the milk to 50°-odd then scoop the stuff out of a vat in less than ten seconds in something that looks like a large brassière? Well he didn’t either, but together with his faithful friends “Jean-Yves” (Mattis Bernard) and “Francis” (Dimitri Baudry) sets about starting his own cottage industry. Thing is, he needs milk. He can’t pay for it, so he decides to purloin it from the neighbouring farm of the sexually curious “Marie-Lise” (Maïwene Barthelemy). It’s a sort of have his cheese and eat it sort of arrangement as he distracts her with nooky whilst his mates help themselves. Of course, this isn’t a sustainable state of affairs for just about anyone, and for the next ninety minutes Louise Courvoisier takes us on a quickly-paced story of human nature and nurture whilst using the rakish “Totone” as an entertaining tool to showcase irresponsibly and selfishness coupled with loyalty and determination. It’s been done on a budget, and some of the production is a bit ropey (especially the edits at times) but there’s a solid cast telling is an engaging story of a community that has it’s own rules of engagement that always requires them to say “holy cow” when astonished, amazed, annoyed - it’s their one size fits all phrase! The on-form Faveau and Barthelemy gel well together, and there is also quite a fun contribution from Luna Garret as the young sister and as feel-good comedies go, this is quite good fun.",

These seven films (I include 'Superman II' because it was mostly Donner's work)--and Nolan's trilogy especially--are what I imagine a great director like Kubrick, Hitchcock or Kurosawa would have come up with, if they had ever been asked to make a Superman or Batman movie. They are the easiest for an audience to identify with because in these the scripts most approximate human emotions and the typical conundrums of the human experience--in short, are the closest, in a good way, they come to the complexities of the human condition.

  "content": "One of the best movies of all time. Christopher Nolan has brought us the Batman trilogy that it made it feel it could happen today. Christian Bale returns as Batman, was able to perform as wonderfully as he did in Batman Begins. The one person that ultimately stole the show had to be the late Heath Ledger who played as the Joker. His performance as a psychotic clown terrorizing Gotham City was one of the best performance as a superhero villain. One of the best parts of the Joker was when he was telling his victims on how “he got his scars?”. Another great part was when he kidnapped a police officer and he was recording it while scaring the man and also giving a warning to Batman. The supporting actor and actresses did a good job of delivering the story. I was disappointed that Katie Holmes did not return as Rachael Dawes but the actress how played as her Maggie Gyllenhaal did a really good job. One of the best parts of Christopher Nolan is that in every movie of his, the cinematography would look amazing and this movie is no exception.",

He includes these scenes to make the film more dark and edgy, yet there are people, from suppressed countries, who have to live through the hardships of violence from law-enforcers and dictatorship every day, and in his obliviousness, Nolan thinks that using this in a superhero film is a good excuse for self-importance.

  "content": "Heath Ledger is outstanding in this follow up to the 2006 \"Batman Begins\" outing for the caped crusader. His portrayal of the malevolent \"Joker' is confident and highly entertaining, treading a fine line between supreme intellect and total insanity with considerable aplomb. He comes back to terrorise \"Gotham\" after \"Batman\" (Christian Bale), \"Gordon\" (Gary Oldman) - now Commissioner in charge of the police force, and newly installed District Attorney \"Dent\" (Aaron Eckhart) had made progress getting the criminals off the street. The \"Joker\", meantime, decides that the best strategy is to rob the mob - and pitching them all against each other, and with the help of the duplicitous \"Lau\" (Chin Han) manages to secure enough of their funds to initiate a campaign of lawlessness that is ruthless, manipulative and good fun to watch. Not only has the man in black his new, potent, nemesis to deal with - but he also begins to realise that his childhood sweetheart \"Rachel\" (this time Maggie Gyllenhaal) is drifting into the arms of the new DA. it is also pretty clear that they are both now proving to be an useful additional weapon in the armoury of his enemy who knows, increasingly, which buttons to press to cause maximum anxiety among those who would bring him down. It's over 2½ hours long, but really does fly by as the quickly paced action really does kick in right from the start. The story is dark and gritty but the pace isn't ponderous and moody - Ledger exudes a sense of peril throughout the whole thing, but that has an edge to it - a sophistication that plays well against the flawed superhero who is increasingly having to identify and cope with his own demons. Sir Michael Caine pops up now and again as his shrewd butler \"Alfred\", always striving to keep his boss on the right side of sanity, and Morgan Freeman continues to feature (sparingly) and his quartermaster. On that latter front, there are loads of new gadgets that still have that element of plausibility to them (no super-powers!). On balance I think I still preferred the first film, but as sequels go - this takes, and will take, some beating. On a big screen in a packed cinema, it's just a great experience.",

It helped in building the mystery and suspense. It was immersive.\r\n\r\n## Character: 8\r\n\r\n**Done perfectly**\r\n\r\nThe main characters were fit for the story. Ordinary people, or snipers, who only wanted to survive and serve their country. People with special skills but at the end of the day, are no different than everyone else. The character backgrounds were not lacking nor it took too much time, and the rest of the character development brought out the basic need of human beings.\r\n\r\n## Enjoyment: 10\r\n\r\n**Kept me on my seat**\r\n\r\nI truly enjoyed watching this movie. Being able to bring me into the story, ensuring I don't spend time analyzing the plot, was an experience I rarely have these days. This movie was did that and kept me on my seat.",

  "content": "The Gorge (2025) is a movie that gets a lot of things right, blending action, romance, and a bit of suspense into a well-paced story. The plot is simple yet clever, unfolding naturally without unnecessary complexity. It keeps things engaging with steady character development, making you feel connected to the leads as their situation evolves. While some critics seem to take the romance out of context, it actually makes perfect sense within the story. It’s not just there for the sake of it but develops realistically based on their circumstances. Sure, there are some plot holes, but unless you're watching just to nitpick, they don’t take away from the experience.\r\n\r\nVisually, the movie stands out with dramatic lighting and smart camera work that keeps you immersed. Even daytime scenes carry a certain mood that adds to the film’s atmosphere. The cinematography is well thought out, with the right angles capturing the emotional depth of the characters while also making the action sequences hit hard. Speaking of action, while there’s plenty of it, the movie does lean more into its emotional core rather than being a full-on action spectacle. The CGI is solid, blending in naturally without feeling overdone, and while some moments might remind you of other films, it never feels like a cheap copy.\r\n\r\nThe performances are strong, with both leads carrying the entire movie effortlessly. Their chemistry feels real, and their dialogue doesn’t come off as forced or unnatural. The script is well executed, moving the story forward at the right pace without dragging things out. The music and sound design complement the film nicely, enhancing key moments without overpowering them. Overall, The Gorge has a high rewatch factor, the kind of movie you'd want to show a friend just to experience it again. If Apple gives it a sequel, there's a lot of potential to expand on what made this one work so well.",

  "content": "The Gorge (2025), directed by Scott Derrickson, is a unique mix of action, horror, and romance. Starring Miles Teller and Anya Taylor-Joy, the film follows two elite snipers assigned to guard a mysterious chasm hiding dark secrets.\r\n\r\nWhile the film delivers thrilling action and strong performances, some critics feel the romance subplot falls flat. The pacing is uneven, with a slow setup and a rushed climax. However, the genre-blending and chemistry between the leads make it an entertaining watch.\r\n\r\nRating: ★★★☆☆ (3.5/5)",

An absurdly illogical story, filled with characters who do improbable, often stupid things. A lack of clear direction in terms of what the story is supposed to be, a love story, an action thriller, a horror, fantasy, sci fi tale?\r\n\r\nOddly, I would argue its the creative cocktail of discordant genres and elements, that actually helps this film succeed. Firstly, \"The Gorge\" works wonderfully as a romance. The chemistry between the key characters sparkles with humour, quirkiness and passion. It functions too, as a fantasy horror, sci fi, thriller with highly creative story and action aspects, that come together beautifully. CGI is only okay but it operates well enough, to make things creepily exciting. \r\n\r\nIn summary, I enjoyed this film. Its compelling, exciting, likeable and inherently watchable, in spite of its often glaring shortcomings. My advice, take a look and see if you agree.",

It's an action-comedy that knows exactly what it wants to be - and thanks to the full commitment of its leads, Ilya Naishuller's creative energy, and a light, entertaining tone, it rises above its formulaic script.\r\n\r\nJohn Cena and Idris Elba form an unlikely but absolutely irresistible duo, Priyanka Chopra Jonas shines as a legitimate action star, and Naishuller's inventive vision delivers moments of pure fun. It may not leave a lasting impression, but for nearly two hours, it's a good time.\r\n\r\nAnd sometimes, that's more than enough.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B",

  "content": "\"Heads of State\" functions as a basic \"buddy\" team up, comedy action flick but its not without its limitations.\r\n\r\nLets start with the positives. Idris Elba and John Cena are perfect choices for this kind of film. Ones loud, a showman, in the role of the US president. The other's more grounded and somewhat acerbic, as the UK Prime Minister. The interplay between the two works well, moving from mutual disdain, to at times grudging, respect and even friendship, of a kind. \r\n\r\nThe action is well paced too, it keeps coming with a little mostly light drama, in between, so you can catch your breath. \r\n\r\nNow to the downside. They can play this any way they like but its hard not to see elements of pro US/UK political and military propaganda, in operation. NATO are heavily pushed as the \"good guys\", taking on \"bullies\". Well tell that to the former Yugoslavia NATO bombed into the ground and ultimately, destroyed. Its unsurprising too, that the \"baddies\"are portrayed as Russian. \r\n\r\nIn summary, if you step past the plug for US/UK exceptionalism there is a functional comedy action flick on offer, that's moderately watchable but by no means special.",

  "content": "<em>'Heads of State'</em> holds positives and negatives, for me. For the opening half of the movie, I was not feeling it. It just all felt so plain, stale and quite grating, to be honest. To my surprise, though, it actually improved as it went on. By the end, I think it actually won me over.\r\n\r\nOne element that was keeping my interest, even amongst the aforementioned slow initial chunk, was the cast. I like Idris Elba, I like John Cena. Therefore, I had just enough in me to keep my eyes on the screen. Their banter is a bit forced, but does become effective eventually.\r\n\r\nPriyanka Chopra is pretty good, plenty of satisfactory action from her; that recap edit is amusingly done, to be fair. Jack Quaid's bit is fun, while Paddy Considine, Stephen Root and Carla Gugino are decent actors to compensate for otherwise quite lame characters.\r\n\r\nIf not for those named, I'd be rating this a lot lower. Still, there are some strong moments and cool shots in there, like the apartment staircase and the lost tooth moment. Annoyingly, there is a fair amount wrong too; for example, the special effects are absolutely not good.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, by the narrowest of margins, I did find this to be passable action fare. It really ought to have been better, though.",

He realized the reasons storytelling have been significantly important since the dawn of mankind, and devised, as the Brothers Grimm did, that fairy tales and children's stories had to be haunting and entertaining to be both memorable and timeless. This is a great film depicting the growing sense as a child approaches adolescence that their parents and their world aren't exactly as they seem, and that through their trials and tribulations (the 'rites of passage', if you will) they'll reach the 'happy medium' they need to in order to find true happiness in their lifetimes.\r\n\r\nI definitely hope that all of Gaiman's books and graphic novels are made into movies (I most anticipate the 'Miracleman' graphic novels--both those by him and Alan Moore).

While there is a lot left unexplained, there is plenty that is exampled about the Beldam and her world.\r\n\r\nThe movie also reminds me a lot of \"The Wizard of Oz\" in a few different ways so its good that there are family friendly movies of this quality that make vague callbacks to classic movies.",

I found it a tiny bit more watchable than its predecessor.\r\n\r\n<em>'365 Days: This Day'</em> still has nothing that even closely resembles a plot, still has extremely limited actors and still shouldn't even exist. However, I'd be lying if I said I disliked it as much as the 2020 original. It's almost like taking out the sexual violence actually makes it more digestable, who'd a thunk it?!\r\n\r\nUnlike that other release, this falls into the more common category of just simply being rubbish. I will say, though, the music kinda slaps. The film is pretty much comprised of a series of sexual music videos placed back-to-back-to-back. Some of music used is well chosen I can't deny, I Shazam'd a couple... admittedly that probably says more about my taste in music than anything else!  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\r\n\r\nThere's even some minor neat cinematography, too. The positives I note are minimal, though, and don't overly help this 2022 production. I have more negatives, which also include an overlong run time and that shoddy ending. At least it marginally improves upon the film it follows, I wonder if its own sequel will do likewise? I plan to find out!",

The male lead looks as if the coke delivery from the wholesaler hasn't arrived, she's naked again. And then, wow, that look - like someone fell asleep on Instagram's sepia filter slider. Everything looks so beautifully even.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the lovely sounds of the best that the German charts have to offer jingle from positions 58 to 72. Is it always the same song? Or lots of them that always sound the same? Is it even music or has someone kicked the neighbor's cat in the shin again? I don't know it. But no time to think. One of the mega hot soft sex games is just beginning, which is always really nasty and unpleasant.\r\n\r\nIt's sooo romantic. She says “Fuck me”, he says nothing as usual, but his look has now changed from a coke hit to a stroke. And then he licks it. Oh, great. With the whole tongue, once across the face and the adjacent table leg. Luckily, the endless banter is filmed in super slow motion, so the torture...cinematic ecstasy lasts much, much longer.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he says... no, that's not true, he doesn't say anything. We only speak here in emergencies. Even if there's probably some kind of mafia plot being told, which I overlooked in all the constant fucking around. Unfortunately, I didn't understand who all these people were until the end. Well, of course it's stupid that I didn't see the first part, but it's also a little bit unusual that this sequel doesn't make any effort to give these characters any depth. Or to explain what is actually going on here. Is anything even going on? Well, it doesn't matter. The guys are supposed to be cute and the women are supposed to be persistent and stupid. And oh - they start slobbering on each other again 😍😍😍\r\n\r\n————\r\n\r\n“365 Days - This Day” is like “Fifty Shades of Gray” for sexually frustrated amoebas like Dr. RTL2's summer question page is filmed as if the Netflix executive suite was personally shitting in your brain, in slow motion. Infuriatingly misogynistic, absurdly badly acted and of course at number 1 on the Netflix charts. When is there a power outage when you need one?",

It feels like they are veering towards the wrong direction, almost resembling pornography rather than a film with substance.\r\n\r\nDespite being somewhat enjoyable, these movies left me questioning why they were even made.

When his team gets a newbie, “Ishikawa”, this younger lad politely but pointedly stresses that he is aiming for more, but he understands why his new colleague “quit”! Subliminally provocative? Well as the pair start to work together, the former man starts to get a little of his mojo back and so when the Force extends it’s age limits, he decides to have another go. Meantime, his would-be colleagues are facing their biggest challenge ever as the mysterious and powerful “Kaiju No. 8” continues to evade them. Now we know a little more about that that the enforcers do, and that helps tee this story up for quite a dramatic ending that tests loyalty, trust and friendships across the board as peril ebbs ever closer and the monsters starts to acquire some distinctly zombie traits. This is a solidly executed and quickly paced adventure that spends a little time building on the characters (from a previous series) but for the most part  just engages us in an action-packed squash the baddies festival with plenty of squelching and loads of gunge and goo covering the streets as and “Kaiju” and the buildings end up collateral damage during the battles. There’s a bit of sarcasm hidden in the dialogue which I quite liked, and the messages of team playing, inter-reliance and of age not necessarily being a barrier to attaining your goals are here but not laboured. Stick around after the credits, there’s another twenty minutes or so (from the next series) that serves to humanise some of these folks, and if you’re looking for a colourfully vibrant series of shoot/slice/blow ‘em ups, then this is for you. Not quite sure how menacing the “sunflower thrust” would be, though…?",

Thanos has appeared in several other MCU films, but he seemed rather flat in those movies. Here, he's allowed to be fully developed as a character. Especially touching is his relationship with his adoptive daughter, Gamora. It's actually surprisingly tender and moving.

  "content": "***Moving ending, but the least of the Avengers movies IMHO***\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2018 and directed by Anthony & Joe Russo, \"Avengers: Infinity War\" chronicles events when the Avengers team-up with several allies to defeat the cosmic despot Thanos, whose goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones to attain unimaginable power and radically solve one of the Universe's most challenging problems.\r\n\r\nThe story focuses on Thanos, Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy, especially Gamora, as well as Iron Man, Doctor Strange and Spider-Man. The rest of the cast members are more peripheral, e.g. Black Widow, Captain America, Black Panther, Vision and Scarlet Witch.\r\n\r\nThis is easily the least of the Avengers trilogy. Not to mention \"Captain America: Civil War\" (2016) and \"Thor: Ragnarok\" (2017) are significantly more compelling and all-around entertaining. Actually, all three Thor flicks are palpably superior, as is \"Iron Man 2\" (2010). If you haven't already, I encourage you to watch these movies prior to viewing \"Infinity War,\" as well as \"Black Panther\" (2018) and the two \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" flicks (2014/2017); otherwise you'll likely be lost because all these movies lead up to this one.\r\n\r\n\"Infinity War\" is certainly an ambitious comic book movie in that it notably juggles so many super-beings, but this lack of focus isn't conducive to suspense or great drama. It's merely decent with overkill CGI. The big battle in the closing act with the easily slaughtered four-armed dog-creatures is curiously dull; moreover, the attempts at humor sometimes feel forced and fall flat, but several jokes are laugh-out-loud funny, e.g. \"Rabbit.\" Thankfully, the film adds moving drama and gets extra points for a bold, poignant climax, which sets up the 2019 sequel \"Endgame.\"\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 29 minute and was shot in New York City, Scotland and Philippines with studio work done in Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayetteville, Georgia. WRITERS: Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-",

  "content": "To be honest, I’d completely forgotten about the original “Accountant” (2016) so wasn’t expecting much from this. Thing is, it’s quite good fun as the meticulous bean-counter with some deep, dark, secrets (Ben Affleck) has to team up with his estranged brother “Braxton” (Jon Bernthal) and an even less willing government agent “Medina” (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) to try to discover just why her boss (J.K. Simmons) was gunned down after a clandestine meeting in a dodgy nightclub. It seems that the siblings have more in common that we (or she) might have expected, and when their techniques manage to successfully marry one’s access to cutting edge technology with the other’s propensity to punch first and sweep up after, she finds herself terribly conflicted. It all seems to come down to some heinous people-trafficking thugs who will stop at nothing to protect their lucrative business and to thwart their investigations, and so some high-stakes assassins are soon on the trail of our intrepid trio. Nope, there’s nothing especially original here. It’s a sort of “John Wick” meets the “A-Team” sort of exercise that allows Affleck to sport a rather odd-sounding accent and Bernthal to wander around in his Calvins exuding a sort of comedy menace that his tattoos do nothing to increase. It’s the latter man who entertainingly does most of the heavy lifting here as the gung-ho enforcer and there’s just an hint of social comment in the form of those scouring the internet to piece together jigsaw puzzles from cameras and fragments of information, but whom society might not have expected to possess such formidably cerebral skills. The denouement does rather run to type, but there’s an abundance of chemistry between the two men that stays the right side of familial sentiment whilst Robinson tries to make sense of it all without an enormous amount of meat on the bones of her role. It’s an enjoyable action adventure that won’t trouble any awards juries, ever, but effortlessly passes a couple of hours and does make you consider just how much of our lives these days is being monitored, recorded and manipulated without us being even vaguely aware.",

  "content": "\"Accountant 2\" is an inadequate sequel to a vastly superior, original action thriller. \r\n\r\nRegrettably, unlike the original film this is a production that doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it an action film or perhaps a comedy?\r\n\r\nThe result is confused and frankly, irritating. The poorly devised comedic elements get in the way of what should be a sophisticated, serious, action film. Its akin to a moron with a air horn and bad jokes, turning up at a Shakespeare festival. \r\n\r\nSuffice to say, you can probably skip the first twenty or so minutes of this film and it wont make an iotas  difference, to the story. Unless, of course, you enjoy watching an accountant with an autism spectrum disorder, try to date the cast, of desperate house wives. Who in their right mind, thought that contrivance, was even remotely humorous. \r\n\r\nWhat comes after is alright from an  exposition driven perspective but again, it undermines the basis of the core story. A lone wolf character, trapped in his own world, who is interesting and engaging, in large part, for that reason. What the script clumsily does instead is try a \"buddy buddy\" team up. The results not great and sadly the dismal, dysfunctional humour, that essentially mocks the main characters autism, continues in unsophisticated, cringe worthy style. \r\n\r\nIn summary, a mediocre, at times stupid, sequel, to a vastly superior, original film. I'm almost inclined to say don't watch this, if you enjoyed the first film. It'll probably just piss you off, as it did me.",

Some of them might actually have nothing to do with the story are just filler or serve as a \"show of power\" with no effect on the story.\r\n\r\nDespite the entire story being revealed, the whole time one would be posing the question: what does this have to do with an accountant? Even the final scenes just raises the question: how in the world would he know? He just went on a rampage for some superhuman  hunch? The previous movie made certain things plausible, but this one just is a disconnected mess that forgets to explain things and does a bunch hand-waving \"you know he's superhuman, so he can do this\".\r\n\r\nAll in all, if you think you're getting another \"accountant\" follow-up, you'll be disappointed. This is a Rambo meets X-Men meets The Punisher meets midlife crisis movie using \"The Account\" characters. If that's your feel, you'll enjoy it.",

The animation is wonderfully detailed, dark and enjoyable with plenty of characters including a mad scientist as well as a mummy, the two-faced mayor and plenty of witches and demons. Not for the first time, Tim Burton shows a visionary imagination that I couldn't help but smile at - and coupled with a marvellous score (and lead vocal) from Danny Elfman we are presented with a thoroughly engaging Christmas story with a bit of a twist. Interesting that in the cinema recently, it struggled to hold the attention of the youngsters which was a shame. Perhaps the intervening years have made this more suitable for adults now?",

Of course the writing is on the wall, and it isn’t in code.

It’s a film that really asks why? But more of us. Why are we watching? The story is wafer thin, the characterisations never quite spark and the perfectly manscaped Goldstein also drives the squarest, design-free, looking Mercedes I’ve ever seen. Clearly car design in the future isn’t what it might be. I was completely underwhelmed by their selfish have your cake and eat it philosophy, faintly disguised as some sort of critique on the ultimate in computer-dating, and though I thought some of their banter was quite funny, that all ran out after about twenty minutes. It’s watchable enough, but wait til it’s on the telly as I doubt you will ever recall it.",

  "content": "So for fifty years, \"GUN\" have kept \"Shadow\" in a gloopy state of stasis deep underground in a top secret facility. All of a sudden he awakens, punches himself out of the place and that means that the director (Krysten Ritter) has to disrupt a family barbecue to engage the services of \"Team Sonic\". Our eponymous blue hedgehog, his best pals \"Tails\" and \"Knuckles\" have settled down to a peaceable life with \"Tom\" (James Marsden) and \"Maddie\" (Tika Sumpter) but realise they have to rise to the occasion so off they go. Imagine their shock, though, when they discover that their new super-fast and super-strong nemesis is another (not quite so blue) hedgehog! Who is he? What's going on? Why does he seem to loath mankind, so? Well that all becomes clear when his puppet-master turns out to be the grand-daddy of all baddies. The ultimate \"Robotnik\" - only with a slightly more rotund belly. Matched, even out-matched, it falls to our intrepid team to try and form an alliance of their own, but how will that endure in the face of such terrible odds? Well don't go looking for any jeopardy here, indeed what starts off as quite a fun series of thwack and pow escapades showing off the skills of the rivals cannot resist turning into the cul-de-sac of sentimentality as the inevitable plot lines grab hold of the characters and turn them into cheesy mush. I always like a good antagonist, but sadly we just know that however dastardly and evil he - in this case the ultra-hammy Jim Carrey - can be, no writer or director is ever going to let him win, and that's pretty efficiently telegraphed right from the start of this sequel that's going to be a prequel too, no doubt. Some of the writing is quite fun, with plenty of contemporary and quite sarcastic references to raise a smile, and there are homages paid aplenty to just about everyone from \"007\" and the \"Fantastic Four\" to the \"Avengers\" - but in the end it's all just a little too shiny and predicable. It looks great on the big screen though and passes a couple of hours easily enough for a Christmas release, but it's all just a bit too derivative for me, sorry.",

I didn't see it at the time, I was one of those kids who hadn't the slightest interest in \"Space Invaders\" nor did I ever have an Atari, but I do recall the fuss that was being made about Disney's first foray into the world of the emerging computer games market. Actually, the story is not so terrible. It's pretty derivative, with a quite handsome, young, 501-clad Jeff Bridges (\"Flynn\") out to avenge himself on the evil \"Dillinger\" (David Warner) who pinched some of his gaming ideas and subsequently rose through the company. Thing is, though, \"Dillinger\" has now designed a \"Master Control Programme\" (Think \"Forbin Project\" from 1970) and when \"Flynn\" tries to break into this system, he is reduced to a player in a game of survival where he encounters fellow rebels \"Tron\", \"Ram\" and \"Lora\". Adventures ensue as they must try to destroy this \"MCP\" before it bores of industrial aspirations, and sets it's sights on the Pentagon and the Kremlin. By any modern day standard, the graphics are linear and static - but there is no doubt that they were groundbreaking and quickly-paced for 1982. The use of light - blue and red for good and evil; the slightly over-exposed imagery to try and create the feeling of an alternative digital environment works well enough and though there isn't the slightest amount of jeopardy as to the ending, it's actually quite an entertaining 90-odd minutes that reminded me that every oak tree starts with an acorn. The attempts to incorporate technical or gaming language into the dialogue are a bit contrived, but there is a fun sequence with a \"bit\" that can only say yes and no as \"Flynn\" drives his wonky thing (\"Max\" from \"The Black Hole\" (1979), anyone?) through the maze of circuitry. Warner is not very convincing, it has to be said - he was rarely much good, I thought - but once it gets going it's an enjoyable piece of cinema nostalgia that looked quite reasonable on a big screen.",

In the 1980s, the creation and gradual massification of the computer (a huge box that we see in the movie and which is now primitive compared to the machines we use) generated a “fever” around computing and led to the creation of games that, later, the World Wide Web has taken it to another level. The movie came out when personal computers started to become popular in the US, but here in my country it took about fifteen years to happen. It's extraordinary to think about this, and how quickly things have evolved. I am thirty-two years old, I belong to a generation that still lived its childhood without technologies, but I was a teenager when they started to become something more visible in our lives. So I can understand why this movie was made, but being a Disney movie, I confess I was expecting better.\r\n\r\nThe film has an uninspired cast made up of third-rate actors. Among all the (almost) anonymous names, only David Warner stands out. The film also has one of the worst dramatic interpretations of Jeff Bridges' life. He was still young here, but the film's material and style didn't help him do a satisfying job. In fact, I blame the screenwriters for most of the film's problems, as they weren't able to come up with a decent story that would justify the feature film. The story that the film brings us is based on the journey of a human being inside the computer, where he will basically have to play and beat opponents. This is very little and it bores us quickly. It seems like a mere excuse for the studio to make an experiment in the field of CGI and the application of technology in cinema.\r\n\r\nWhere the film really bets heavily is on the visuals, heavily stylized and inspired by two obvious elements: the integrated circuits used in engineering and the colorful and (now) somewhat forgotten neon lights. In those late 1980s, neon was something that drew attention in the urban landscape, and there was no street or square where, at dusk, dozens of neon signs did not light up. It's something that has virtually disappeared in the last decade, but that gave the city a certain life. I confess that I felt some nostalgia when feeling the aesthetic influences of all that, but I recognize that the film tried to do something far ahead of its time: the Hollywood Academy itself refused to nominate this film for an Oscar because it considered that CGI was a form of cheating. And perhaps also because they did so early, the resources used were so rudimentary (even though they were the best there was) that they gave the film an extremely heavy and dated look, which aged very poorly. The same can be said of the sound effects and even that soundtrack, so dominated by the synthesizer.",

For that he has to win the Grand Prix in Japan and that involves his embarking on the ultimate in fitness and endurance regimes, aided by his own chemical romances that frequently seem to render him little better than catatonic. Domestic dysfunction ensues as he has to face up to his responsibilities and settle his priorities before what he has comes crumbling down. It’s a true story, but it just didn’t engage me at all. Johnson comes across well as the amiable and dedicated athlete, but a film about any sport that requires a rule change to ban eye gouging was probably never really going to work for me. The fight scene are sparing, occasionally graphic, and they do convey just how brutal this mixed martial arts combat can be, but the characterisations here are just all too sterile to engage. Whilst Kerr comes across as a decent human being, Blunt’s performance doesn’t really make anything like enough impact as it trundles along without much from the dialogue to make me care. Tangentially, it does quite enjoyably poke some fun at the inanity and banality of sport’s broadcasting punditry and I didn’t hate it, but I’ll probably never watch it again.",

  "content": "This had great potential as a martial arts extravaganza, but it relies way too heavily on some very repetitive and not so special effects to get its story across. It’s all about “Guo Jing” (Zhan Xiao) who’s the adopted (Han) son of the great Mongol chief Genghis Khan (Bayaertu). He has been out on a mission when he encounters the young “Huang Rong” (Dafei Zhuang) and the two sort of fall for each other, then a serious misunderstanding drives them apart and he has a series of encounters with the menacing “Venom West” who is desperate to obtain a scroll that will give him powers to rule the Earth. Instead, though, it’s our young hero who - thanks to some expert help from another constantly hungry master, secures the benefits of those teachings. On returning home, he discovers that his father has decided it’s time to make war on the Jin and to do that he is going to march his formidable army through the territory of the “Song” - and the young man cannot allow this transgressions of his erstwhile homeland. Thanks to the Khan’s loved-up daughter he manages to escape and take refuge in the besieged Xiangyang - but can he hope to defeat the approaching army, reunite with his gal and, don’t forget, the malevolent “Venom West” is still seeking global domination. If you’re looking for eye candy then Zhan Xiao does just about enough here, but the rest of the casting is pretty unremarkable and the mythology is really all rather undercooked as we lumber on for two and a half hours to a denouement that’s great for the CGI-fetishists amongst us, but otherwise isn’t really anything much to write home about. The story darts about too much, threads are left unfinished or simply abandoned and by the end I felt I’d got very little to get my teeth into. Visual effects technology is only going to make these kind of epic historical films easier to make, so to stand out there is going to need to be more work on the characterisations and the plot! This has the odd moment of mirth, but for the most part it’s just a procedural waste of an opportunity. It’s my kind of film and I do like the genre, but as the arch-ninja “Yoda” himself might have said - “an handsome man and some deft use of the computer do not a compelling story make”.",

  "content": "Some birds aren't meant to be caged.\r\n\r\nThe Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.\r\n\r\nThere was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.\r\n\r\nIt's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.\r\n\r\nThose in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the \"Birdman Of Shawshank,\" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.\r\n\r\nIf you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10",

  "content": "The thing about adapting a short story for cinema is that we tend to get a great deal of padding to get it to the duration. This film is certainly guilty of that, with the first half hour spent on way too much character establishment that really has very little to do with the gist of the story. Once it does get going though, it's a cleverly crafted and well put together scary movie centred around \"Finn\" (Mason Thames). Bullied at school, he is protected by his friend \"Robin\" (Miguel Cazarez Mora) until he disappears. He isn't the first child to disappear either, indeed five from this small community have gone missing over the last few weeks. \"Finn\" is walking home after school when he encounters a man who has dropped his groceries. Offering to help, next thing he knows he is in a grubby basement with only a soiled mattress and a disconnected phone on the wall. His mask-clad captor - who has something of the \"Joker\" about him - insists he is in no danger, but the phone on the wall starts to ring and the callers - the other five victims - warn him otherwise, and help him to try to best his nemesis. There are one or two jump moments, but mostly there is an effectively accumulating sense of menace well fuelled by confident efforts from Thames and his sister \"Gwen\" (Madeleine McGraw) who might have inherited her mother's ability to see the future in dreams - a skill that may prove vital in helping the police save her brother from certain death. There are violent undertones, but very little actual violence is shown as the young man comes to terms with some of his own demons and to try to escape. The last ten minutes redeem it well, and there is something distinctly satisfying about the conclusion. Scott Derrickson has provided us with one of the better Blumhouse dramas of recent years that is sure worth a watch.",

The movie does a great job setting up the main characters in the beginning that gives you a relationship with them and genuine desire for them to succeed. There are a few plot points that are a little questionable, but are they are minor nitpicks and didn’t pull me out of the story too much. The performances all around were great. Ethan Hawke does fantastic in his limited screen time. He conveys the mental state of the Grabber with such nuance, it really makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up. The children do very well too, especially in the more emotionally heavy scenes. A few of the classmates performances in the beginning were a bit awkward.  Overall, I had a great time with this movie and it is a testament to the directors and writers that they could adapt such a creative thriller from a short story.\r\n\r\n**Verdict:** _Great_",

Thames is particularly convincing as the terrified boy who is trying to make sense of the situation he's in. Hawke is also chilling as the killer, though his character is not as fleshed out as I would have liked. The movie is well-made and well-acted and has a solid story with some creepy moments — and the length is exactly right. An enjoyable addition to the genre.",

  "content": "Brooking no argument, history should quickly regard Peter Jackson’s The Fellowship Of The Ring as the first instalment of the best fantasy epic in motion picture history. This statement is worthy of investigation for several reasons.\r\n\r\nFellowship is indeed merely an opening salvo, and even after three hours in the dark you will likely exit the cinema ravenous with anticipation for the further two parts of the trilogy. Fellowship is also unabashedly rooted in the fantasy genre. Not to be confused with the techno-cool of good science fiction, nor even the cutesy charm of family fare like Harry Potter, the territory of Tolkien is clearly marked by goo and goblins and gobbledegook. Persons with an aversion to lines such as, “To the bridge of Khazad-dûm!” are as well to stay within the Shire-like comforts of home (their loss).\r\n\r\nWith those caveats in place, it bears repeating: fantasy does not come finer. There are electrifying moments — notably the computer-assisted swooping camera through Isengard as it transforms into a factory for evil — when Jackson’s flight of fancy approaches the sublime as the romantic poets would understand it: inspiring awe.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the thorny issue of Tolkien die-hards and their inevitable gripes — “What no Tom Bombadil?” — Jackson’s screenplay (written in collaboration with Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens) is both bolder and more judicious than Steven Kloves’ surprisingly timid retread of Harry Potter. In particular, rescuing the romance of Arwen and Aragorn from the footnotes and the elevation of Saruman to all-action bad guy actually has a corrective influence on Tolkien’s often oblique and female-sparse source material.\r\n\r\nThere are problems, though. The three-hour running time is high on incident and low on discernible form. After successive detours to Elf habitats Rivendell (the watery home of Elrond) and Lothlórien (the forest home of the Lady Galadriel), the uninitiated might well ask why these crazy Elf kids can’t just live together and spare us all this attenuated dramatic structure.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, the action clearly climaxes in the desperate flight from the Mines Of Moria, where the largely seamless SFX is showcased in the best possible light — total darkness — but the narrative demands a different, downbeat ending. Indeed, but for some fine emotional playing from Bean, Mortensen, Astin and Wood, the final fight might feel like a particularly brutal game of paintball in Bluebell Wood. But then, the real battles are yet to come...\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict - Putting formula blockbusters to shame, Fellowship is impeccably cast and constructed with both care and passion: this is a labour of love that never feels laboured. Emotional range and character depth ultimately take us beyond genre limitations, and it deserves to play as wide as a certain Mr. Potter.\r\n\r\n5/5\r\n\r\n- Colin Kennedy, Empire Magazine",

  "content": "Tolkien’s adventure/fantasy LOOKS and SOUNDS fabulous, but is not without flaws.\r\n\r\nRELEASED 2001 and directed by Peter Jackson, “The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring” adapts the first part of JRR Tolkien’s popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth. The story starts in the homeland of the Hobbits (innocent, diminutive humanoids) where Frodo (Elijah Wood) is instructed by the noble wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to quickly leave the Shire with the powerful One Ring in his possession. Gandalf and Frodo are later accompanied by seven others, the titular ‘Fellowship of the Ring,’ to take the ring to the only place it can be destroyed, the fires of Mount Doom in Mordor. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the main cast include Sean Astin (Sam), Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn), Sean Bean (Boromir), Christopher Lee (Saruman), Orlando Bloom (Legolas), John Rhys-Davies (Gimli) and Hugo Weaving (Elrond).        \r\n\r\nThis three-hour fantasy features a diverse cast of colorful characters, quaint beings and settings, moments of genuine wonder, dark ee-vil creatures, high adventure, thrilling brutal action, a superb score, magnificent locations (forests, mountains, rivers, etc.), and wondrous CGI sets. The film LOOKS and SOUNDS so great that it’d be sinful to give it a lower rating. \r\n\r\nThere are problems, however, at least for those who aren’t uber-fans of Tolkien. For one, the opening is hindered by prologue that is overlong and convoluted, not to mention unnecessary. The bulk of it could’ve been conveyed later via flashback, which they do a little bit anyway. Secondly, the story takes forever to build any drive. Thirdly, except for maybe Frodo and Gandalf, the characters are shallow and I didn’t care much what happened to them. Fourthly, main protagonists getting seriously wounded and everyone else expressing their melodramatic concern gets redundant.  \r\n\r\nFifthly, there are only two females in the main cast (Liv Tyler as Arwen, a half-Elf princess, and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, a royal Elf); unfortunately, their parts aren’t much more than glorified cameos. “Mythica: A Quest for Heroes” (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $93 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the filmmakers knew enough to include a couple of prominent babes as key protagonists in the story. \r\n\r\nDespite these negatives, “The Fellowship of the Ring” is the best of the trilogy and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados, especially Tolkien fans.                      \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours 58 minutes and was shot in New Zealand. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B- (6.5/10)",

  "content": "Overall, I give this four stars.  Not five, because some of the changes really bug me, as a long-time Tolkien fan, but a solid four.  \r\n\r\nThe casting, to start, was brilliant.  Sean Astin was the absolute perfect choice for Sam, and did a remarkable job bringing that character to life for us.  He really WAS Sam, in this role, in a very deep way.  I always liked his acting, but here, he showed how talented he actually is.  Just amazing.  Elijah Wood gives a great performance of Frodo, and those expressive eyes of his really add a lot of depth to the emotions the character goes through, which are such an important part of the story.  Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan both did great work, for our other two main hobbits.  Their smiles, their singing; just every aspect of these characters was so real.  Viggo Mortensen, of course, was excellent.  He's always good, and though I never would have pictures him as Aragorn, he delivered everything we could hope for.  Great choice for that role!  John Rhys-Davies, as expected, gave us the Gimli we wanted.  Phenomenal actor, and I can't imagine anyone doing that role better.  Orlando Bloom plays a convincing Legolas, and handles the nuances of being an elf quite well.  Sean Bean as Boromir was outstanding, bringing the strength of that character to life, and making us love him.  Then we have Ian McKellen, as Gandalf.  I could never have chosen someone for that role, but the casting folks hit a home run with this one.  Everything about his character was just right.  Literally everything.  I can't read the books without seeing these people in these roles now.  The rest of the cast ws good as well.\r\n\r\nThen we have the setting.  New Zealand has to have some of the most utterly gorgeous scenery on the planet.  Seeing it in these movies was great, and convincingly Middle Earth, and seeing more since, in other videos, just WOW!  Thanks, to the people of New Zealand, for allowing this to be filmed there!  \r\n\r\nThe sets were just fantastic.  Everything looked as good as I'd always hoped it would look, with all the charm, mystery, and wonder  Tolkien fan could hope for.  From Bag end to Rivendell to the vastness of \r\nMiddle Earth, everything we saw was just right.  \r\n\r\nThe only issues I had were some of the changes.  Yes, I know things don't always work in movies as they do in books, but when whole sections are just omitted, that bothers me.  It's not like the movies weren't long already!  That omitted section, with which Tolkien fans will be quite familiar, was a very important part of the plot!  I also didn't care for some of the other changes, and the way Arwen was used, the scene at the river being one example.  \r\n\r\nAll in all, though, this was a well done movie, and even though some things bug me, this film, and the rest of the series, will be viewed many times.  Classics, worth collecting and treasuring.",

  "content": "Well, I wouldn’t read this review if you are a true fan of fantasy adventure epics, because I am not. Don’t get me wrong, I like this movie and have watched it a few times over the years, but I have watched  (or read, for that matter) very little else in the fantasy  genre. I didn’t get too far into the Game of Thrones as the violent rapes got old for me fast. \r\n\r\nSo I watched this first entry of the Lord of the Rings trilogy as just a viewer, not a fan, and I liked it just fine. The complex plot held together well and the scenery was gorgeous. There was violence, but not gore, and for those who don’t like war movies, there wasn’t as much of it here as there is in the other two films of the trilogy.\r\n\r\nI gather the elfin roles for women were enlarged and brought to the fore, and why not; women were mostly good for setting mead and large pieces of rare meat down on tables in front of their warrior men.\r\n\r\nI must confess, I found it jarring that the warriors like Strider were so invincible, walking into a horde of sixty orcs and scattering them like toy soldiers with his sword. I know they are epic heroes, but if I’m an orc, I stand back and throw something or whatever, but it is similar to the old legends with semi-gods like Achilles, back when Hector was a pup.\r\n\r\nI am not going to compare the film to the book — I read it decades ago when I was in high school. It is worth watching and though real fans will take this with a large grain of salt, I think it is possibly the definitive adaptation of the book. (I need to watch the other two entries in the series before I say the same about those.) if you are among the 12% percent of movie goers who haven’t seen it, give it a try.",

A great start to the franchise.\r\n\r\n<em>'The Lord of the Rings'</em> is yet another film series that I am incredibly late to viewing, at least I've finally got around to it... albeit almost twenty years on from this film's release.\r\n\r\n<em>'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'</em> is delightful. I never know what to expect from a film that goes on for nearly three hours, the pacing has to be near perfection for it to work - and boy does it here. The run time flew by, which is always a terrific sign.\r\n\r\nI love a load of things about this, the one that actually sticks out most is the outstanding score. Music can play a huge part in how much I enjoy a film, so I'm delighted to say that the score is here is fantastic. That is by no means the only positive, obviously.\r\n\r\nThe cast are excellent. Elijah Wood gives a strong performance in the lead role. I've seen Wood in others things down the years and have actually found him a bit hit-and-miss, but here he is very good. Elsewhere, I really enjoyed watching Viggo Mortensen's character.\r\n\r\nAway from those two, there are a whole host of noteworthy cast members. Orlando Bloom, or Will Turner to me, is involved, as are the likes of Ian McKellen and Sean Bean. I also liked Liv Tyler in her role.\r\n\r\nThe look of the film is spectacular, and has aged extremely well even to this day. Everything from the cinematography to the costumes is brilliant, those two things really make the film come alive - helped by the aforementioned score, of course.\r\n\r\nVery eager to check out the sequels, prequels and, eventually, the upcoming television series.",

  "content": "This film may be perfect.\r\nBased on the fantasy world written by Tolkien, we see the halfling hobbits, the most unlikely of heroes, a breed of human type beings who indulge in pleasures, games, and fun, and do little evil.\r\nIn the same world are more powerful beings, some good, like the elves and wizards, some evil, like the orcs, trolls, and dragons, and some in between, like the dwarves and men.\r\nAnd one evil super being, Sauron, the second in command to the \"devil\" of this world called Middle Earth, and that devil called Melkor is now in chains and powerless, so Sauron rules all evil.\r\nThat said, we get a very faithful version to the book, only improved. This is the first of three segments called \"The Lord of the Rings\". The parts left out are parts best left out. Tom Bombadil, for example, along with his wife, represents a very Hitler like Aryan ideology of supremacy that Tolkien often engaged in. \r\nThe film begins with a narrative and action sequence that is awesome, and then goes into the \"status quo\" setting of the \"shire\" of hobbits, much like the status quo setting of films like \"Women of Dolwyn\".\r\nFrom there, we get an amazing story of four hobbits who embark on a journey of utmost importance, joined by a wizard, an elf, a dwarf, and two men.\r\nThe direction is stunning. The motivation even better explained than in the Tolkien books. This is a masterpiece.",

  "content": "So now that the picture houses across the UK are beginning to reopen, this is the third film I've settled down to watch in front of a huge big screen - and it's a belter. You can only wonder at the sheer imagination of JRR Tolkien and of Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh & Philippa Boyens as they adeptly adapt this epic tale of power for a new generation. Certainly, it over-hams the accents - maybe just a few too many \"rrrs\" in \"Arrragorrrrn\" but otherwise it's a feast for senses. When the hairy-footed Hobbit \"Bilbo\" (Sir Ian Holm) gets to eleventy-one he sets off to write his life-story with the elves. He leaves his possessions - including a mysterious ring - to Frodo (Elijah Wood). When visiting wizard \"Gandalf\" (Sir Ian McKellen) identifies it as the epitome of wickedness that puts all of their lives are in danger, \"Frodo\" and his lifelong friend \"Sam\" (Sean Astin) must flee their bucolic happiness. This first instalment of the trilogy tracks the journey of the hobbits as they meet \"Stryder\" (Viggo Mortensen) and together try to evade the pursuing wraith attempting to get to \"Elrond\" the Elvish king in \"Rivendell\" and decide what is best to do with this evil, seemingly indestructible talisman. Their only solution proves to be returning the ring to the lava-filled cavern of \"Mount Doom\" where it was forged: only there can it's corruption be defeated. The brave hobbits, together with two men, an elf and a dwarf set out to accomplish this all but impossible task fighting the weather, evil orcs, malevolent magic and the harsh terrain on their treacherous way. It's the ultimate fantasy adventure; that sticks to the spirit, if not to every word, of the original work. The effects both in make-up and from the computer are expertly applied creating a real sense of tension and peril that compliments, rather than subsumes, the actual action and beautiful cinematography of the New Zealand scenery through which our intrepid gang must travel. This is probably the weakest of the three episodes as it takes a good hour to get going; but once it does and the \"Fellowship\" takes firmer form with a superb John Howard-Davies; a handsome Orlando Bloom and even the usually wooden Sean Bean raises his game to give us as a truly cracking, at times quite scary adventure that is magnificently scored by the inspired Howard Shore. This is not really a film that works on the telly - however large the screen may be. To do justice to the creativity of all concerned it just has to be given the respect it deserves and be seen in the cinema. If you get a chance, you should go see it (again!).",

  "content": "One Trilogy to rule them all. Peter Jackson’s The Fellowship of the Ring, the start of this epic journey, remains unmatched in its reverence for Tolkien’s work – not merely as an epic tale, but as a moral and mythological construct with its own internal gravity. Unlike many contemporary fantasy productions, which often treat Tolkien’s world as a loose template to be re-skinned, Jackson’s film operates as a careful translation, not a reinvention. Every creative decision, from script to score to set design, reflects an understanding that Middle-earth is not a playground, but a legendarium – a world with its own laws, languages, and deeply rooted cosmology. It is this sense of literary responsibility that makes Fellowship not just a good adaptation, but a great one.\r\n\r\nToo many modern shows, even those cloaked in Tolkien’s vocabulary, feel less like adaptations and more like speculative reinterpretations – injecting modern anxieties and tropes into a narrative that was already rich in timeless concerns. Where those newer productions often flatten the moral contours of the story into grey ambiguity or impulsive spectacle, Jackson’s Fellowship preserves the text’s theological seriousness and philosophical clarity. It understands, crucially, that Tolkien was not writing about swords and sorcery, but about humility, sacrifice, and the perilous allure of domination. The Ring is not a mere object of power – it is a spiritual test – and the film never lets us forget it.\r\n\r\nThe performances reflect this deeper understanding. Ian McKellen’s Gandalf is not a stock wizard, but a being of deep time, burdened by knowledge and reluctant authority. Elijah Wood’s Frodo captures the very soul of Tolkien’s hobbit – a creature of small stature and immense will, shouldering a task no one would envy. Sean Astin’s Samwise is played not for comic relief, but as a paragon of unsung virtue: loyalty without ambition, courage without ego. Viggo Mortensen’s Aragorn is a man wrestling with history, shaped by the burden of lineage, not the thrill of it. These portrayals are not just emotionally effective; they are textually faithful.\r\n\r\nCate Blanchett’s Galadriel deserves special mention. Her portrayal embodies the strange, luminous power of the Elves as Tolkien wrote them – otherworldly and terrible in equal measure. Her temptation scene is delivered with haunting restraint, the grandeur of her voice a vessel for ancient sorrow and quiet wisdom. This Galadriel is not a warrior queen in the modern sense, but a bearer of deep time, whose greatness lies in her refusal to grasp at power. It is a performance that understands the Elvish condition: to be fading, beautiful, and bound to a world no longer theirs. Blanchett’s screen time is brief, but the echo of her presence lingers – like Elven light in dark places.\r\n\r\nJackson’s adaptation respects Tolkien’s languages and mythic structures with near-obsessive care. Elvish is not set dressing; it is spoken with phonetic integrity, tied to cultures that feel ancient and real. The geography, costumes, architecture – each bears the mark of deep lore, not just visual flair. Howard Shore’s score, informed by the same gravitas, does not accompany the film so much as inhabit it. His themes are not just musical motifs but narrative threads, echoing the rise and fall of kingdoms and the quiet dignity of small acts of heroism.\r\nWhat distinguishes The Fellowship of the Ring is that it treats Tolkien’s world as something already complete – something to be entered humbly, not reshaped. In doing so, it achieves a rare artistic feat: it becomes an extension of the text, not a commentary on it. While newer works may borrow Tolkien’s lexicon and aesthetics, Jackson’s film believes in his world. It does not merely entertain; it partakes in a mythology. That belief, that reverence, is what endures.",

Yes it was an apocalypse story but I have really not seen anything quite like it before. Yes moving mazes and all that have been done but the story as a whole was new to me. That was refreshingly enjoyable in this age of more or less boring Hollywood remakes.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I quite enjoyed the movie. I would label it a “young adult” movie. Not only because the lead characters as well as almost the entire cast are teenagers but the story itself is clearly at a level directed towards a younger audience. But then, who do not wish they were young again? I quite liked the story. It clearly had its usual collection of illogical moments and plot holes but nothing really really annoying as far as I am concerned.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion all of the cast did a decent enough job of their roles. Some roles mostly consisted of standing around in the background of course but the lead characters was not bad. Teresa was more of a plot element than a lead character in this movie though that has to be said.\r\n\r\nI did indeed like the maze itself. It had a quite cool look and was well done from a cinematic point of view. The one thing that did not come out in the movie though was the reason for it all. I know that is supposed to be the mystery but it was rather frustrating nonetheless to not get any clues whatsoever. What on Earth could be the purpose of having a bunch of kids live through this experience in that way?\r\n\r\nSometimes the behavior of these kids where somewhat annoying of course. I especially disliked the plot element where that dumbass kid seemed to just want everything to stay the same forever. It is of course a classical element in stories like this but it still annoys the hell out of me every time.\r\n\r\nBottom line is still that I found this a rather enjoyable movie. I would definitely want to see the other two books made into movies as well. I have not read the books by the way so me thinking this was a new story experience is of course partly due to this fact.\r\n\r\nSHARE THIS:",

  "content": "Amnesiac Dylan O'Brian emerges from a lift shaft in the ground to be found by a group of lads who've all been left to live a sort of subsistence existence inside a whopping great stone maze. A quick bout of wrestling with \"Gally\" (Will Poulter) reminds him that his name is \"Thomas\" but that still doesn't help him - or anyone else - with what he's doing here. Each day the great doors of the maze open up, but anyone who does try to make it out is never heard from again. The lads are completely clueless until a girl is sent amongst them, and she \"Teresa\" (Kaya Scodelario) might just have the answer as \"Thomas\" manages to galvanise a few of his pals to test the secrets of the maze. Can they escape, and if they do - what are they escaping too? Is it freedom or might it actually be worse? They do know that the maze is being patrolled by some menacing metal monsters so it's quite a dangerous leap of faith they must take - but it's either that or staying put. This is clearly part one of a franchise, so much of it is simply character establishment with some ground rules laid down for them and us. A reliable cast of associates help keep the film story and the characters develop well enough - though quite why Londoner Poulter had to have an American accent is anyone's guess. The Dashner novels upon which this is based follow a familiar line, but director Wes Ball tries to keep the film moving along quickly with plenty of moments of peril, acrobatics and using a star whom the camera likes and who energetically enters into the spirit of this adventure. It's enjoyable fayre - you'll never remember who was who afterwards, but these sort of franchises were all the rage in the mid-noughties, and this is perfectly watchable and occasionally exciting brain fodder.",

  "content": "Re-watching The Maze Runner was a pleasant experience, and I still enjoyed it as much as I did the first time. The film's directing stands out, with a well-paced first act that successfully introduces us to the characters, the maze, and their unsettling situation. This setup provides a strong foundation for an exciting second act and a finale that leaves the audience with lingering questions, perfectly setting the stage for the sequel.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography deserves praise as well. A standout moment is the opening sequence: the close-up shots immerse us in the disoriented perspective of the protagonist, only to transition smoothly to a zoom-out that reveals the towering, closed walls of the maze. This visual storytelling continues throughout the movie, maintaining a consistent sense of scale and tension.\r\n\r\nThe acting is another strong point. Most of the cast delivers solid performances, creating believable connections and helping viewers grow attached to each character. Their chemistry and emotional delivery effectively add weight to the story's stakes.\r\n\r\nWhile the script is generally solid, it does feature a few clichéd jokes here and there, but these moments don't detract much from the overall experience.\r\n\r\nThe Maze Runner is a well-executed film that combines strong direction, engaging visuals, and compelling performances. It builds a suspenseful and immersive world while keeping the audience eager for what comes next. I thoroughly enjoyed revisiting it.",

  "content": "There are so many movies within the Despicable Me franchise that I've lost count of all the storylines in each. While I've never been a big fan of these movies, they at least always felt exciting. However, this fourth installment in the Gru storyline is little more than a dud. The silliness and excitement are there for younger audiences, but the film lacks heart.\r\n\r\nOne of the main problems with the Despicable Me movies is the tendency to pile on more characters just to add celebrity voices to the cast. This fourth movie is no exception. While the addition of new characters can sometimes breathe fresh life into a franchise, here it feels like a missed opportunity to develop a more heartfelt story. For instance, the introduction of a new, younger female character named Poppy as a heist partner for Gru could have been a chance to add depth. However, it might have been more impactful to see Gru partnering with his oldest daughter, who is now a teenager. This would have added a layer of connection and growth between Gru and his daughter, showcasing his evolving role as a father.\r\n\r\nThe film also introduces a subplot where some Minions are turned into a superhero team, only to be used in the movie for less than 10 minutes. This subplot feels like a wasted narrative thread that could have added excitement and depth to the story. Additionally, one of the main Minions, Ralph, is stuck on a vending machine for the entirety of the movie, reducing his role to a mere gag. This sidelining of key characters in favor of introducing new ones dilutes the emotional core that could have made the story more engaging. \r\n\r\nWhile my son enjoyed the movie, which makes sense for his age range, it’s important for these films to also entertain the parents who are watching with their children. The earlier movies in the franchise managed to strike a balance between humor for kids and clever moments for adults. This installment, however, feels more like a series of gags strung together rather than a cohesive story with emotional weight.\r\n\r\nIf there are more films in the Despicable Me series, I believe it’s time to hang it up. However, if the franchise continues, I will wait for streaming to watch them because I am not interested in seeing them in theaters. The magic that made the original films entertaining for a broad audience seems to have faded, and without a significant shift in storytelling, future installments are likely to feel just as lackluster.",

The family \"Gru\" have a new child who doesn't much take to his father which only makes matters worse when arch-nemesis \"Maxime Le Mal\" - who is intent on turning everyone into cockroaches - escapes from custody bent on revenge on the man who put him in jail in the first place. Better safe than sorry, \"Silas\" relocates the family to a safe house where they have to pretend to fit in with the vacuous tennis club set, but one of that number - the feisty \"Poppy\" knows the secret and blackmails \"Gru\" into helping her pinch \"Lenny\" the badger from under the eyes of the diminutive \"Principal Übelschlecht\" at his alma mater. This adventure narks the headmistress and when she sees some video of the perpetrators, she's straight on to the phone with \"Maxime\" who hatches a plan to steal the baby and give him wings! The minions - and the newly formed and enhanced \"Super Minions\" - still manage to have some fun here as they discover their new home has a vending machine and an endless supply of popcorn, and there is some wit in the dialogue but the story itself is all pretty derivative and the animation looks a little too tired now. What was ground-breaking looks so much less now and the writing and characterisations are nothing special anymore. It does liven up for the last ten minutes, but the previously innovative and enjoyable mix of menace and mayhem has largely gone.",

They felt phoned in as well. Maybe its about time we stop making these yeah?\r\n\r\nOn a side note gru has a kid who can clearly understand english which tells me hes at least 2-3. Yet his adopted children are still the exact same age? This only works in television cartoon shows I feel like, especially when time has progressed since gru and lucy have been married.

  "content": "**This time a London family struggle in their haunted house.**\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I am not a big fan of the first film, but I liked that. Now this sequel was not bad either. This time it takes us to the London. But the film reminded me the 80s film 'Poltergeist', particularly the second part. So don't assume it is exactly the same, only the scenes involving house seems similar, but the story was different. It is another true story based film, that's what they said in the opening statement. You're not forced to believe that, if you're here for an entertainment, you will get that if you put your logics away for the two hours.\r\n\r\nA family of four young children and their mother living in a house in the London witness some serious paranormal activities lately. Particularly the eleven year old girl affected the most with the spirit the house possessed. So the American couple from the first film are brought in to do their best to help the family. When they try to contact the spirit, they won't get what they were looking for. Instead, an unexpected blame goes for the girl and soon the family loses confidence in them. The overcoming those misunderstanding, particularly realising the truth brings a twist before concluding the tale.\r\n\r\nThe one twenty minute never looked too long. Because there's always something keeps happening, so the audience to keep engaged with. Probably this is won't be your best horror film of the years, but being a horror themed film, it had good form of those contents. Not too scary, at a time those clichés were used in a good way to bring freshness in the scenes. I will credit the writers for that. Besides, the actors were undoubtedly good, including those little ones. For me this is a better horror film and I definitely look for another sequel. I hope this one would stand up to your expectations.\r\n\r\n_7.5/10_",

While this is touched on briefly, it's done more in the context of people who don't believe them are all mean and unsympathetic.\r\n\r\nAgain, it's a competently made horror film that's better than its predecessor, if a little predictable, but don't look at it as being based on a true story.

  "content": "<em>'The Conjuring 2'</em>, oof. What a chore to sit through. The only redeeming quality I have for this film is Madison Wolfe's performance as Janet, which is fairly impressive for a youngster. That aside, I have nothing that I can praise or even mark as better than mid, sadly.\r\n\r\nThe 2hr+ run time obviously doesn't help, but that actually isn't even a major negative for this movie. The plot, which feels like a rehash of the 2013 original in most (if not all) areas, is just so bloated and boring, I initially thought the English-ify of the story would bring freshness but, aside from the amusingly bad cockney accents, it's barely noticeable when in yet another dingy house.\r\n\r\n<b>[bit of a spoiler on the way]</b>\r\n\r\nThe demons felt like a drop-off from the first flick, I admit the Bill character turned out to be a tiny bit more interesting than I thought it was going to be early on. Even then, I wanted a little bit of resolution with Bill once 'the end' happens (with Anita too). Unless it happened and I was already mentally zoned out by then, possible I guess?\r\n\r\nI think another thing that affects my enjoyment is the lack of jeopardy for the human characters, once is fine but back-to-back? Like they put all the pieces in place to kill one of them off and then just bottle it right at the last minute; this one here, for example, would've been very meaningful too. That dog in the original must feel extremely hard done by, ought to sue thy agent. I suppose it needs to cling to the \"true event\" (lol).\r\n\r\nAh, I've just checked the general reception this received. Wow! Most of the time I question myself when I see that I am in the minority, I gotta be honest this time its on you guys - please do send me whatever it is you lot are smoking though! Joking aside, it would appear I'm in the wrong, the majority view speaks for itself, but damn... surprised to say the least!\r\n\r\nJust remembered that I did actually say in my review of <em>'Annabelle'</em> (5/10) hours ago that if it was any longer then I would've disliked it more. Well, step forward this movie. I didn't think the proof would arrive in the pudding so soon.",

  "content": "This second cinema outing for the ghost-busting Warren’s takes them to London’s northern district of Enfield where the Hodgson family are having a fairly torrid time. Younger daughter Janet (Madison Wolfe) and her elder sister Margaret (Lauren Esposito) have been pining for their absent father and so rather optimistically consult a home-made ouija board to find out if he is ever going to return home again! Their mum Peggy (Frances O’Connor) and the audience know that he’s shacked up with a woman round the corner with their new set of twins. Anyway, Janet goes to sleep and that’s the beginning of their nightmare as an old gent (Bill) who reputedly died in an armchair in the house decides to revisit the family, rearrange the furniture, change the television channels and generally cause mayhem for this cash-strapped family. Meantime, Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) has been painting a fetching portrait of a nun (think the art-loving Sister Wendy Beckett from the mid-1990s) who seems to be the source of some discomfort for wife Lorraine (Vera Farmiga). Might these two mysteries be connected? Well the church asks the pair to do some surreptitious investigations in the UK and so off they go. Of course they are sceptical, but when a bit of levitation creeps in, the doors start to slam of their own accord and the water supply seems intent on building them an indoor swimming pool in the basement, they begin to wonder if Janet et al are really hoaxers, or might there actually be something altogether more malevolent at work here. According to local sources here, the Warren’s spent hardly any time at all at the house and so much of the substance to this story is unsubstantiated conjecture, but James Wan still manages to create something plausibly scary as these children and their mother - at her wits end - try to deal with this unwelcome phenomena. It’s end-to-end stuff with the girls also delivering spookily (and shriekingly) as the shadows come alive with well-mixed audio effects and some false teeth with a mind of their own. Wilson and Farmiga over-egg their earnestness a bit at times, but as the “McMillan and Wife” of the occult, they do well enough to send the odd tingle up and down your spine. It’s probably half an hour longer than it needs to be - there’s a wee bit too much preamble, but it’s certainly at the better end of the genre for my money.",

There's a great battle scene in there, some fun characters and strong effects. It's a tad too long, but not by much.\r\n\r\nIt has a nice charm to it also, as they set up Narnia excellently. The quartet of children are very well cast, all four of them suit their roles to a T. Georgie Henley is sweet as Lucy, while William Moseley and Anna Popplewell fulfil the roles of Peter and Susan comfortably. Edmund, meanwhile, is of course annoying, but Skandar Keynes does a good job portraying him.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, Tilda Swinton and Liam Neeson are terrific casts as the White Witch and Aslan. Both do great, especially Swinton. James McAvoy, Ray Winstone, Michael Madsen and Rupert Everett are smart choices too.\r\n\r\nI've, as far as I'm aware, never seen the two sequels so very much look forward to seeing what they have in store for me. They'll do well to match this first film, that's for sure.",

  "content": "In my last review (which you can find on my Letterboxd), I said _The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe_ was a \"nearly perfect film.\" Well, I am here to say that with this viewing, to me, it is a perfect film. \r\n\r\nI used to always think this film was a sort of step below LOTR, and, while LOTR is indeed a masterpiece of cinema, I don't regard this film as lesser.\r\n\r\nThe movie is just pure magic! Every aspect of the movie (minus the CGI – which doesn't really hold up [except for Aslan] but is still serviceable) is even better with age! And I find myself moved emotionally by more things this time than I ever have watching this film.\r\n\r\nThe score by Harry Gregson-Williams is just phenomenal. Especially \"The Battle\" – that goes without saying. But this time, part of the magic and nostalgia I was struck by was the musical piece that sounds like it's a song. The one that plays while the train is leaving London. (I found out it's actually about halfway into the track \"Evacuating London.\") That magical song, combined with the great camera work by Donald M. McAlpine and the appearance of the movie title makes for feelings of peak nostalgia and magic for me.\r\n\r\nAlso, this film has one of the best opening scenes of all time. When Netflix (finally) remakes the films, I don't know how they can top this opening. \r\n– In fact, that's another thing about this movie: There are so many things that I don't think any remake could top. Liam Neeson as Aslan, Tilda Swinton as Jadis, the White Witch, and James McAvoy as Tumnus. – Oh, and, though he's not in the book, the centaur, Oreius (played by Patrick Kake), is so cool! Can't top that.\r\n\r\nAlso, the costuming is excellent – especially for the White Witch – and the gryphons are so cool! The sound design on their shriek gives me chills (in a good way).\r\n\r\nAnd I can't go without saying that this is also an emotional story because of what the story represents, the symbolism of the story.\r\nEdmund represents us – represents me, a sinner. I who have walked in rebellion against God, and who am by nature opposed to God. And as such, I deserve the wrath of God, punishment that He would be fully just to give me. But Aslan represents Jesus Christ. Like Aslan sacrificed himself for Edmund, dying the death he should have died, Jesus sacrificed Himself in our stead, taking upon Himself the wrath of God we deserved, so that “if [we] confess with [our] mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in [our] heart that God raised Him from the dead, [we] will be saved” (Romans 10:9), we “will not perish but have eternal life” (from John 3:16), and as a result of that faith, “we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (from Romans 5:1).\r\n\r\n‭‭Ephesians‬ ‭2:1‭-‬10‬\r\n\r\n> “[1] And you were dead in the trespasses and sins [2] in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience— [3] among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. [4] But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which He loved us, [5] even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved— [6] and raised us up with Him and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, [7] so that in the coming ages He might show the immeasurable riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. [8] For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, [9] not a result of works, so that no one may boast. [10] For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.”",

  "content": "CS Lewis certainly had one heck of an imagination and it is rarely better exemplified than in this lovely fantasy adventure. Four wartime siblings are evacuated from London to stay with the reclusive \"Professor Kirke\" (Jim Broadbent) in the relative safety of the English countryside. Once they get there, the housekeeper \"Mrs. Macready\" (Elizabeth Hawthorne) makes it quite clear that they are to be seen and not heard! Boredom sets in and thus a game of hide and seek seems sensible. \"Lucy\" takes refuge in an old wardrobe - a wardrobe that has a secret! Much to her astonishment, she finds herself in a snowy land with a single streetlamp and there meets \"Mr. Tumnus\" (James McAvoy) - a scarf-clad faun. She returns to her brothers and sister and after some convincing, they join her in the wardrobe and all discover the delights and dangers of \"Narnia\" meeting loads of new friends and a couple of not so nice wolves, too! This is the first of the adventures of the \"Pevensie\" children in this mysterious land where animals can talk and winter is perpetual under the control of the villainous \"White Witch\" (Tilda Swinton). They align with \"Aslan\" the all powerful lion (voiced by Liam Neeson) and have a battle royal to free the kingdom from her icy grip. The CGI isn't, to be honest, great. Indeed, some of the effects are a bit cheap and cheerful for 2005; but the story, settings and characterisations are great - as is Harry Gregson-Williams' eerie and gentle score.",

  "content": "Rewatching The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe reminded me why it’s such a timeless movie. It still gets me every time, especially the lullaby scene with Mr. Tumnus, played beautifully by James McAvoy, who is one of my favorite actors. Liam Neeson’s voice as Aslan is inspiring and adds so much gravitas to the character. But for me, the standout is Tilda Swinton as the White Witch. Her performance is chilling and commanding, making her one of the most memorable parts of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe production is top-notch. The visuals are stunning, especially considering it was released in 2005, and they mostly hold up well even now. The costumes and set design are fantastic, capturing the magical and otherworldly feel of Narnia. The soundtrack is another highlight, adding emotional depth to key moments and making the experience even more immersive.\r\n\r\nBased on the beloved novel by C.S. Lewis, the film does a good job of sticking to the important plot points while making the story accessible to a new generation. Of course, no adaptation is perfect, but this one stands on its own as a great piece of fantasy storytelling. It’s not just a movie; it’s a journey into a world full of magic, courage, and redemption.\r\n\r\nThis movie also feels like the perfect pick for the holiday season. It has that warmth and wonder that makes it ideal to watch with family at Christmas. The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe remains a classic, and I can’t recommend it enough for anyone who wants to experience a bit of magic",

  "content": "Right from the outset, this doesn’t hang about as a near perfectly executed crypto robbery is carried out by a gang of young men in Macau. Despite mobilising the police and the several thousand cameras located across the city, the cops are short on clues so they draft in retired “Wong” (Jackie Chan) whose meticulous approach to his work soon leads them to suspect that the legendary “Shadow” is masterminding a group of ninja-esque men who are masters of disguise, martial arts and technology. He decides that the only way to track this man down is to recruit a squad of officers that don’t look remotely like they are investigating and then to embark on the mother of all door-to-door searches. Of course, and maybe a little implausibly, they manage to identify him (Tony Leung) - we know who it is right from the start - and a war of attrition ensues not just between the two men, but amongst their nemesis’s increasingly manoeuvred and conflicted “family” for whom trust and loyalty are soon severely tested. There is loads of action throughout, but it’s not the repetitious sort. More stylishly and tightly edited and choreographed with no windows, bones or furniture safe as the CGI and the action mix well before a denouement that offers us something of a twist and perhaps the scent of a revenge sequel down the line. The charismatic Chan brings a considered charm to his role, most of his antagonists are very agile and easy on the eye and Leung really does bring a little of the “Fu Manchu” to his character - powerful, menacing and always one step ahead. You might not be so certain about the safety of your bit-coin billions after watching this, though!",

  "content": "The Lord of The Rings are still occupying the three top places of my top ten movies list. Needless to say I am a fan of Tolkien and his Middle Earth fantasy story. I never felt that The Hobbit series could match the original trilogy but then much of the story in The Hobbit is not really Tolkien’s but produced by Hollywood scriptwriters to embellish the story enough to fill three movies. It is not a bad attempt by any means (for being a Hollywood one) but it does not really reach the heights of The Lord of The Rings.\n\nStill, I quite liked these movies. They are good adventure, fantasy, special effects movies. Thus it saddened me when I went to IMDb and the first things I saw was a bunch of people shouting crap and giving it one star reviews. That is just so much rubbish. This is the third movie and it is not vastly different from the others. If you disliked the first ones so much why go and see this one? Also, the harping about not following the book. At this point that is a nonsense argument. It was fairly obvious that it was not going to follow the book in detail when it was announced that there were going to be three movies and if you did not get it then then you should have gotten it from the other two movies. One star ratings looks more like trolling to me.\n\nAnyway, back to the movie itself. I definitely liked this movie better than the second one. It was on par with the first one for me. There was less silly stuff, less stuff that just felt like fillers and the special effects were generally good.\n\nThe story and the implementation is, as I wrote, less filled with fillers as the last movie. At least from my point of view. Still though, the story is not at all up to the standard of the original Tolkien works. It shows that it is a Hollywood product that favors effects and quantity before depth and quality. The battle at the end was epic but at the same time somewhat nonsensical in how people ran back and forth clobbering people and beasts right left and center. I did quite like the ramming troll though.\n\nI have to say that I did not like that weasel Alfrid. Sure he was meant to be disliked but he got tiresome rather quickly. He could have been left out after being pushed into the water as far as I am concerned. After that I just got annoyed every time he appeared and I got especially annoyed by the fact that everyone, even Gandalf, seemed to trust him to actually do what he was told. I was hoping all the way to the finishing scenes that he would meet a gruesome end.\n\nOn the whole I definitely liked this movie. It had a “Tolkienesque” athmosphere, decent acting, decent story and loads and loads of special effects. Even though it does not reach the heights of The Lord of The Rings it is definitely great entertainment for the fantasy, not to mention special effects, lovers.",

  "content": "After a singularly slow start to the series and despite the fact that I still can’t quite engage with Martin Freeman’s title character, I reckon that this is the best of the trilogy with some superb visual effects underpinned by a solid and characterful story right from the start. With the marauding “Smaug” breathing fire all over the town, it falls to “Bard” (Luke Evans) to try to save the day. Meantime, “Bilbo” (Freeman) is having to contend with the increasingly megalomaniacal dwarf king “Thorin” (Richard Armitage) who is suffering from a golden equivalent of snow-blindness that is testing the loyalties of his friends and allies alike, risking conflict with the now seriously narked Elven army of “Thranduil” (Lee Pace). With battle lines drawn, a siege looks inevitable and with dwarves and elves at loggerheads there could be only one, sinister and malevolent, winner waiting in the wings. This story is now taking us closer to the realms of the LOTR stories and the overlapping storylines help put much more meat on the bones of many of the characters - a benefit of doing the second story before the first, cinematically. There’s still no getting away from the fact the some of the acting talent here is at best a bit lacklustre and at times the likes of Aidan Turner and Messrs. Freeman, Armitage and Evans make even Orli Bloom look like a potential BAFTA winner. Luckily, though, there are the sonorous dulcets of the imposing Sir Ian McKellen, Cate Blanchett and Sir Christopher Lee to add some gravitas to the stunning photography and effects that complement well the fire-breathing dragon, the swordplay, the building sense of malevolence and mistrust and, of course, the formidable battle scenes with just about everyone from Middle Earth fighting for survival or domination. It’s probably the only one of the triptych that hits the ground running and effortlessly sustains it’s lengthy duration and if you can settle down to watch it on a big screen that does justice to the imagery and to Howard Shore’s musical imagination then this is well worth it.",

  "content": "Hmmm. Never before have I heard anyone proudly declare \"We are Swiss\" in quite such an underwhelming manner before, and that rather sums up the lacklustre performance of Claes Bang as the title character in this verbose crossbow chronology. Traumatised by his experiences in the Crusade, he's now not a natural rebel but is instead content to live peaceably with his wife and son. When he comes to the rescue of a stranger whose wife had just been raped and murdered by the occupying troops of the King of Austria (Sir Ben Kingsley) his former valiance is rekindled and releases all manner of hell on his unprepared, unarmed and unsuspecting people. Pursued by the maniacal \"Gessler\" (Connor Swindell) and his blonde henchman \"Stussi\" (Jake Dunn), he has to rediscover his skill with the arrow, and yes - there's the legendary scene with the apple and the boy's head! There is some stunning Alpine photography mingled in with the pretty obvious CGI, and to be fair to it there are plenty of action scenes as Tell and his rapidly increasing circle of friends proves to be quite adept at reducing their foes to wriggling corpses. Sir Ben has managed to fish out his eye patch from \"The Last Legion\" (2007) but like Sir Jonathan Pryce, he doesn't really feature enough to make much more than a few cameo appearances to add a little bit of Thespian gravitas to this rather sterile and flat history. The characters are really lacking in charisma in this film and the long-winded dialogue and charm-free efforts from all but, perhaps, Dunn - think a weedier version of \"Stamper\" from \"Tomorrow Never Dies\" (1997) just don't really resonate much at all. There's plenty of attention to the creative detail with the costumes and castles all fitting the bill nicely but it's probably half an hour longer than it needs to be and screams sequel at us at it's all rather rushed end.",

Jason Momoa is, by far, the MVP of the whole film, transforming an easily forgettable villain into a truly hilarious explosion of charm and *camp*. The cast still holds that enviable chemistry, even though Daniela Melchior and Portugal deserved more screen time.\r\n\r\nConsidering the previous entries, the energetic action actually turns out to be quite tolerable when it comes to the expected illogical insanity of the franchise - which will please viewers with less patience for absurdity. Despite an overuse of false backdrops and extremely agitated editing, the entertainment levels are well within the acceptable spectrum.\r\n\r\nIt's clearly the first film in a final trilogy. Interpret this last sentence as you wish.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B-",

  "content": "A vacous and imbecile action potboiler which does what it's meant to do, \"Entertain\".\r\n\r\nFast X is a noisy actioner which pushes the limits of inventive action set pieces but this time stays grounded compared to the space shit they tried last time. As a franchise, fast and furious has always been extremely self aware of what it intends to present , over the top, adrenaline pumping , never seen before action and Fast X delivers in that front yet again. The sheer amount of scale and production value gone into this makes this an insane film. While it entertains us throughout because of its action, having an engaging and appealing premise has always been the weakest aspect of this franchise. The story is yet again dumb and feels like an Indian tv soap where no one dies and pops up again and again. \r\n\r\nThe cast rather than balancing the count keeps getting bigger with each iteration. The best thing the makers have done this time is to integrate Jason Mamoa as Dante and he is maniacal and psychotic. Probably the best villain in the franchise until now. He brings in the much needed wackyness to the film. Alan Ritchson joins the cast and he is brilliant. While rest of the cast remains same and their chemistry adds the elements of humour , Brie Larson's entry doesn't make any sense. Let's hope she springs in a surprise in the next 2 films. The film finishes on a cliffhanger and promises more madness in the next. However dumb it may be, the franchise will be remembered as the one which defies physics in the most realistic way possible.\r\n\r\nOverall, if you are a fast and furious fan there's no one stopping you, but if you are not then you are missing the out on the most badass franchise coming to a close. I recommend keep your brains at home and go have a blast.\r\n\r\nInstagram @streamgenx",

  "content": "Starting off with a bit of nostalgia, this high-octane adventure sees just how \"Dom\" (Vin Diesel) et al become the targets of \"Dante\" (Jason Momoa). The most improbable of robberies from a police station followed by an even less plausible chase through the streets of Rio dragging a ten ton safe behind their cars! Now I was thinking, this is going to be rubbish. Well, it isn't actually. Though it is pretty repetitive and the story is rather episodic in delivery, it's still got just enough of a story to underpin the collection of lively set-piece car chases that trash just about every city in the world - especially Rome. The camp but deadly Momoa looks like he is having an whale of a time with his role and though the \"family\" sentiment of the whole thing starts to grate after a while, the production is high standard, the pace is relentless and the visual effects are put to good use for most of it. The rest of the cast deliver adequately enough - I could have been doing with a bit more from \"Cipher\" (Charlize Theron) and a lot less from the double act of \"Tej\" (Ludacris) and \"Roman\" (Tyrese Gibson) that got on my nerves a bit after a while. From a plot perspective, it's an introductory offer - they are setting the scene for the next one (or two) that will doubtlessly be a spectacular denouement, tinged with tragedy, that probably only leaves Nepal as a country untouched by their wrecking! It's harmless fun. It won't challenge you one little bit, the acting and writing are largely forgettable and it will slot into the library of the rest of this franchise easily enough. If you don't know what you are going to get from the series by now, then you ought not to bother.",

  "content": "Writing a review for a sequel like “Fast X” feels pretty pointless. It’s the type of adrenaline-fueled blockbuster that rabid fans will eagerly shell out money to see and want to love, while snobby critics will begrudgingly watch with a chip on their shoulder combined with a predetermined disdain for whatever will unfold. I’m a big fan of the series, even when it veered away from fast cars and leaned into the street superhero action angle. Most moviegoers would expect “Fast X” to be a film that’s packed with big, loud, dumb fun. It’s big and loud (and certainly dumb), but there admittedly is a slight shortage of fun.\r\n\r\nThe plot is so stupid, but it builds on the best film of the franchise, “Fast Five.” If you don’t remember the movie, don’t worry: the first 15 minutes are a rehash of everything that happened. Even newbies will be up to speed quickly. The film focuses on Dante (Jason Momoa), a formidable foe who is fueled by revenge. He’s ready for blood, and Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his “family” are squarely in his sights. This installment takes the crew from Rome to Rio de Janeiro and beyond, with explosions, car chases, fist fights, and lots of faces from the past.\r\n\r\nThe story isn’t what most came for anyway, and the pacing slows under the weight of Diesel growling about “family” and “faith.” The jokes aren’t really funny either, and Louis Leterrier‘s direction is lacking. The threadbare writing is awful. The CGI looks shoddy. The situations our heroes are put in are so far-fetched and ridiculous that it makes Tej (Ludacris) and Roman’s (Tyrese Gibson) trip into space in “F9” seem like no big deal. In other words, there is a lot to dislike about this movie — but there’s also plenty to enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe stunt driving is absolutely spectacular, as are the majority of the action sequences. For every misstep, there’s an equally thrilling chase (like a bomb tearing through the streets of Rome). The cast mostly gives performances that are better than expected. The real MVP here is Momoa, who creates a truly terrifying character in Dante, a big screen villain for the ages. Obviously having fun with the role, Momoa completely steals and runs away with the movie. He is absolutely terrific.\r\n\r\nThe film is packed with all the fan favorite characters and a few new added for good measure (although Brie Larson as a CIA agent and Leo Abelo Perry as Dom’s son don’t bring that much to the table). Diehards will be pleased to see Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Mia (Jordana Brewster), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), Jakob (John Cena), Han (Sung Kang), Queenie (Helen Mirren), and baddies Shaw (Jason Statham) and Cipher (Charlize Theron).\r\n\r\nAlthough I’m a fan of all things “Fast and Furious,” it’s becoming increasingly difficult to overlook the fact that each film seems to become even more dependent on over-the-top silliness. “Fast X” feels like it’s headed toward the end of the road, a dead end from which the series will never return. But if you’re searching for a bit of mindless entertainment, it’s also a great way to kick off the start of the summer movie season.",

I will say Jason Momoa, in whatever he was doing, was a hoot in the cold-blooded villain. And in typical \"Fast\" fashion, there are scenes that don't make a lick of sense. I found some of the action scenes to be well directed I guess by journeyman Louis Leterrier who took over from Justin Lin who left only a week into production.\r\n\r\nGiven I wasn't that big of a fan of Fate of the Furious or F9, I think I've grown out of this franchise and would be a good thing to bring it to a close. **2.5/5**",

For instance, having the aliens act a lot like human special forces, with gear that's familiar but adapted to reflect their status as an advanced, if brutal, race. \r\n\r\nThe story is quite sophisticated too, for what is essentially a film driven by action. On the subject of which, the action is frenetic, convincing and  well paced, throughout the length of the film. There really are, few dull moments.\r\n\r\nWhats also surprising, is the acting is more than competent from a cast I'm not that familiar with. well, aside from the iconic Linda Hamilton, of \"Terminator\" fame. \r\n\r\nIn summary, for a film that's clearly not an A lister this sci fi gem puts a lot of films with much fatter budgets, to shame. If you liked \"Alien(s)' and the original \"Predator\" films I know you are going to enjoy \"Osiris\".",

That was, I think, the most intense ending of a movie in a year or probably more than a year. People actually screamed when the screen faded. And of course, people couldn't help but talk about it. It was an open-ended movie where people will have their own endings. My favorite part was Joseph Gordon's fight scene. I think he has the most fun part in this movie.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy rate for this movie is A.",

  "content": "Is there anyone on earth who doesn't like Christopher Nolan’s films? Inception is one of his masterpieces. It’s a science fiction film released in 2010 and written by undoubtedly one of the greatest directors in Hollywood, Christopher Nolan, the creator of such stunning films as ‘Memento’, ‘The dark knight’, Prestige’ and ‘Interstellar’. the cast is impressive: the main roles are played by Leo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine.\r\n\r\nThe film is based on the idea of lucid dreams. In the story, the professionals of industrial espionage, using special techniques to steal valuable secrets from the depths of the subconscious during sleep, when the human mind is most vulnerable, learn a new technique - the ‘inception’ of ideas into the human mind through his dream. The main character - Dom Cobb is a talented thief, his rare abilities made him a truly valuable player in the treacherous world of espionage, but they also turned him into a perennial fugitive and stripped him of everything he had ever loved. One day Cobb has a chance to correct mistakes. His latest case can bring everything back, but for that he needs to do the impossible - inception.\r\n\r\nThere are so many good things about the film. The plot of the film is definitely mind-blowing. You won't be able to take your eyes off the screen. The soundtrack is written by Hans Zimmer, who is certainly one of the most sought-after composers. I think all his music is incredibly touching, dramatic and powerful. There are also some iconic songs we all know. The work on the special effects is done flawlessly, evidently, a lot of money was spent on this. The acting is also wonderful, Leo DiCaprio, who was the first actor to accept the offer to play in the film, has done an amazing job.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that viewers can find bad about this film is that it can be extremely difficult to perceive. If you don’t watch the film close enough you can simply get lost in all these jumping from dreams to reality.\r\n\r\nA curious fact is that Christopher Nolan released the film in 2010 but started working on it at the beginning of the 2000s! I would recommend everyone to see the film, even if you are not interested in sci-fi.",

  "content": "<article>\r\n  <h1>Inception: A Mind-Bending Masterpiece of Modern Cinema</h1>\r\n\r\n  <h2>Christopher Nolan's Visionary Dreamscape</h2>\r\n  <p>Christopher Nolan's \"Inception\" (2010) stands as a testament to the power of original storytelling in modern cinema. This science fiction thriller takes viewers on a mesmerizing journey through the intricate landscapes of the human mind, exploring the nature of reality, dreams, and the subconscious. With its multi-layered narrative and stunning visual effects, \"Inception\" challenges audiences to question the very fabric of their perception, solidifying Nolan's reputation as one of the most innovative filmmakers of our time.</p>\r\n\r\n  <h2>Plot and Concept: Dreams Within Dreams</h2>\r\n  <p>At its core, \"Inception\" follows Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a skilled extractor who can infiltrate people's dreams to steal information. Cobb is offered a chance at redemption and a way back to his children through one last job: planting an idea in someone's mind, a process known as inception. This seemingly impossible task involves creating a dream within a dream within a dream, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in both the dream world and filmmaking itself. The intricate plot weaves together elements of heist movies, psychological thrillers, and mind-bending science fiction, creating a narrative tapestry that is as complex as it is captivating.</p>\r\n\r\n  <h2>Performances and Characters: A Dream Team</h2>\r\n  <p>DiCaprio delivers a powerful performance as the tormented Cobb, haunted by the memory of his wife Mal (Marion Cotillard). The supporting cast, including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, and Cillian Murphy, bring depth and nuance to their roles, each contributing significantly to the film's emotional core and intricate plot mechanics. Cotillard's portrayal of Mal is particularly noteworthy, embodying both allure and danger as a projection of Cobb's guilt-ridden subconscious. The ensemble cast's chemistry and individual performances elevate the film, grounding its high-concept premise in genuine human emotion and conflict.</p>\r\n\r\n  <h2>Visual Spectacle and Technical Mastery</h2>\r\n  <p>Nolan's vision is brought to life through stunning cinematography by Wally Pfister and groundbreaking visual effects. The film's most iconic scenes, such as the folding Paris cityscape and the zero-gravity hotel fight, are not merely eye candy but integral parts of the narrative. These visually arresting moments serve to illustrate the malleable nature of the dream world while pushing the boundaries of what's possible in cinema. Hans Zimmer's score complements the visuals perfectly, adding layers of tension and emotion to every scene. The technical prowess displayed in \"Inception\" sets a new standard for blockbuster filmmaking, seamlessly blending practical effects with CGI to create a world that feels both fantastical and tangible.</p>\r\n\r\n  <h2>Legacy and Impact: A Dream That Lingers</h2>\r\n  <p>Since its release, \"Inception\" has sparked countless discussions and debates, particularly regarding its ambiguous ending. This open-ended conclusion invites viewers to question the nature of reality and the power of perception, leaving a lasting impact long after the credits roll. The film's influence can be seen in subsequent movies that explore similar themes of reality versus illusion. \"Inception\" not only entertains but also challenges its audience, encouraging multiple viewings to fully grasp its complexity. It stands as a pinnacle of Nolan's filmography, showcasing his ability to blend high-concept ideas with emotional depth and spectacular action. In the landscape of modern cinema, \"Inception\" remains a towering achievement, a dream from which many viewers may never want to wake.</p>\r\n</article>",

  "content": "**The Family Plan is another forgettable streaming knockoff that is only worthwhile for diehard Wahlberg fans.**\r\n\r\nThe Family Plan is an entertaining film, largely due to the charisma of its lead stars. However, the script lacks originality and the plot is predictable, resulting in a forgettable viewing experience. It almost feels as though Apple+ used an AI generator to create a generic spy comedy centered around a family discovering their father's secret assassin identity. The action sequences are passable, but the story follows such familiar beats that it fails to hold my interest. Thankfully, Mark Wahlberg and Michelle Monaghan's performances add some enjoyment to the film, preventing it from being completely dismissible. While I found it enjoyable to watch once, I don't see myself revisiting it. Ghosted offers a more entertaining take on the spy-comedy genre. Nonetheless, if your watchlist is lacking options, Wahlberg and Monaghan's presence might make The Family Plan worth a try.",

Meantime, the folks in that city are ruled by a young man \"Ji Fa\" (Yosh Yu) who is enthusiastic and honourable, but not exactly a tactician. Despite his best efforts, the encroaching army arrives at the walls of his city aided by four powerful giants, all equipped with magical talisman. It's during this battle that the lines are truly drawn with a few immortals coming to the aid of the city and with both \"Ji\" and \"Deng\" finding themselves facing a new scenario for which neither are prepared, and which tests their mettle and their loyalties as an angry denouement looms. This is my kind of film: mixing mystery and mythology with superb special effects and a solid story that, though maybe a little predictable towards the end, has all the ingredients of a stylish and engaging acton-adventure. There's imagination a-plenty gone into the production and the characterisations offer us a little more than just the usual linearly flat persona. The green flying ogre works hard for his living here, and the last twenty minutes are lively and colourfully delivered. Might their be a trilogy? It does need a cinema, a big screen makes all the the difference.",

Dornan is very easy on the eye, but otherwise we are all subjected to a dull, ploddingly produced series of poorly lit scenes that drag on interminably. There's no point evaluating the acting nor the script, they don't matter. This is just a poor attempt to entertain or shock or both that does neither, remotely. Titillatingly tantalising?

  "content": "<em>'Captain America: Brave New World'</em> came close to pleasing me, but in the end I think it is not consistently enjoyable enough to be classed as something I'd want to watch again and/or recommend. There is quite a bit about it that I did like, but the down moments hurt the ups.\r\n\r\nThe cast and their characters are positives. I'm a big fan of Anthony Mackie's as he has done many roles in films that I've highly, highly enjoyed; interestingly, he has appeared in three of the fourteen films I've given a total 10/10 to. Here, he is very good in the titular part.\r\n\r\nI'm not someone overly attached to Marvel and therefore Chris Evans' Captain America, so this new era doesn't hinder my interest in the lead character. I'm admittedly not wholly convinced Mackie is undoubtedly a perfect fit for the role, though his performance itself is perfectly watchable and fun enough.\r\n\r\nCarl Lumbly's performance as Isaiah is great in this, he genuinely made me care quite a bit about Bradley; especially in the more emotive scenes. Danny Ramirez, Harrison Ford, Giancarlo Esposito (a little typecast still, sadly) and Tim Blake Nelson (albeit the weakest) are also pluses that I have for this movie.\r\n\r\nMy main issues lie with the plot and how it is told. There were too many moments where I could feel myself losing interest in events onscreen, most notably across the first half. The second half is better paced, if still not making for superb viewing. I was firmly awaiting the credits, which is never a good sign.\r\n\r\nWhen I was locked on to the story, I did dig it. I particularly found the interactions/dynamics between characters to be solid, for example Cap with Carl, Joaquin and Seth. I just think what lets this down, unfortunately to a somewhat damaging degree, is that the plot just isn't quite good enough. A shorter run time (even though it isn't that long) may have helped, but I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nI just realised that this is the first MCU film that I've scored below 7/10. That feels harsh, it isn't as bad as that sounds at all, but thinking about this and the other flicks from the franchise that I've rated similarly it is actually merited. <em>'The Incredible Hulk'</em> and <em>'Ant-Man and the Wasp'</em> were my bottom two, both are better films.",

  "content": "“Brave New World” but same old yarn, sadly. Morgan Freeman clearly didn’t fancy this one so Marvel have resurrected another ex-president in Harrison Ford to put together a treaty that will deliver the old save the globe type of thing. It’s all about this giant hand-shaped structure that has emerged from the ocean and that contains “adamantium” - and that’s even more indestructible than “Vibranium” (how can something be more indestructible?). Anyway, before this accord can get signed off by a curious quadrumvirate of the USA, India, France and China a shipment of this new material gets pinched and it’s down to “Capt. America” (Anthony Mackie) and his new sidekick “Torres/Falcon” (Danny Ramirez) to retrieve it. Loads of end-to-end fisticuffs later and the goods are secure which earns our dynamic duo and their inspirational trainer “Bradley” (Carl Lumbly) an invitation to the White House. That’s where the wheels really do come off as their pal starts taking potshots at the President and we discover that the erstwhile somewhat militaristic and temperamental “Ross” and “Cap” aren’t exactly on the same page. It’s pretty obvious that there’s a third party pulling the strings so it’s going to need all of his patience and guile if the shielded wonder is to retrieve his mentor from solitary, rebuild his relationship with his president before that man really sees red, and also get to the bottom of a dastardly scheme that seems bent on causing international strife between the USA and Japan. Mackie’s a charismatic man and he does what he can with this, but the story comes across as little more than an hybrid of “Top Gun” (1986) meets “Tomorrow Never Dies” (1997) with an unremarkable cast, including Ford’s “Ross”, that struggles to make any impact as it races along for two hours without presenting anything original or particularly entertaining. It passes the time, but is yet another bland offering from a studio that is increasingly resorting to it’s creative technicians to design something that looks great but resonates not remotely. Disappointing, sorry.",

Most importantly, Anthony Mackie's performance as Sam Wilson proves, without a doubt, that he was the right choice to wield the shield left behind by Steve Rogers. The actor perfectly captures the duality of being both a global symbol and a man still searching for his own path, bringing a unique approach to the legacy of the titular hero.\r\n\r\nIt may not be top-tier MCU, but it's a film worthy of being experienced on the big screen.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B",

  "content": "While I find it the same general quality of a majority of what Marvel has put out, it is a flawed film with moments you could tell were caused from one of the many reshoots they did of the film. (It was shot 4 times) One funny example is when Cap and Falcon are on the run they \"ditch their smart phones\" so they can't be tracked. Leaving them in their offices. On the Car ride to their destination, Falcon isn't wearing a watch. Then at the destination he's wearing a Smart Watch. You know something that can be tracked..... Anyway it was off putting to have Hulk's cast and Villains but not included him, at all. Not even a photo, just \"old news footage\" from the Harlem battle. Mr Blue doesn't even mention Bruce at all. Instead blaming everything on Ross.\r\n\r\nWhat the film did have, I'm sure it makes much more since if you watched Falcon&Winter Solider, but if you didn't they sort of explain things in the film. At least the short 1 dialogue explain it way. The ending battle was a, what the heck? Move and what happened to the President make little Legal since, although in one cut of the film he died. Because Bruce nor She Hulk are in prison, so at best they would keep him locked up until he learned to control it. As the illegal thing he did was, what the Accords already did, keeping a dangerous super locked up. Not very well, but still the same thing. Definitely not as bad as some say it is, but not joining the few MCU films I will rewatch or rewatch over and over again. I give it a C-",

  "content": "Captain America: Brave New World was overall an enjoyable watch, even if it had a few noticeable flaws. Anthony Mackie truly shines in this film as Sam Wilson, more so than in his previous appearances. He brings charisma, sincerity, and depth to the role of Captain America in a way that finally feels fully realized. The supporting cast was equally strong, though Harrison Ford’s portrayal of President Thaddeus Ross, while solid, came across as a bit stiff and frankly, as if he was a little too old for the role. He did bring gravitas, but it sometimes felt like he lacked the physical presence the character demanded.\r\n\r\nHowever, the film stumbled in a few areas that impacted my overall enjoyment. My main gripe was with the final battle sequence. Sam Wilson, a fully human character without the super-soldier serum, directly confronting and battling a Hulk-level threat stretched believability too far. It felt unrealistic even by Marvel standards, detracting from the otherwise solid storytelling.\r\n\r\nThe subplot involving Sam debating whether or not to take the super-soldier serum was also underwhelming and repetitive. We've seen similar storylines explored before in the MCU, and this didn't add much new depth or meaningful insight into Sam’s character. It seemed to slow down the momentum rather than enhance the narrative.\r\n\r\nAnother puzzling choice was the extensive callbacks to 2008’s The Incredible Hulk. Given the significant differences in tone, actors, and general feel, the tie-ins felt forced and disconnected. The reliance on such an old and somewhat obscure MCU entry was distracting and didn’t resonate emotionally.\r\n\r\nDespite these flaws, there was plenty to like. The film's pacing was mostly good, the action sequences well-choreographed, and visually, it delivered exactly what you'd expect from Marvel. Red Hulk was very cool when he finally appeared, and his presence boosted the film's overall entertainment value.\r\n\r\nIn short, Captain America: Brave New World is worth watching for Marvel fans, particularly for its strong characters and compelling action. However, Marvel needs to either commit to realistic storytelling for human-level heroes or provide them with suitable enhancements or foes. A solid film, but not without its clear areas for improvement.",

  "content": "Based on Akira Kurosawa’s 1963 film High and Low, which was loosely based on the 1959 novel King Ransom by Ed McBain (the pen name of Evan Hunter), Highest 2 Lowest is Spike Lee’s modern-day reimagining. David King (Denzel Washington) is a music mogul making his fortune as having “the best ears in the business.” He established Stackin’ Hits Records, which was a huge record label for black artists in the early 2000s.\r\n\r\nIn the modern day, David lives in a penthouse suite overlooking all of New York City with his wife Pam (Ilfenesh Hidera) and 17-year-old son Trey (Aubrey Joseph). But he isn’t on top of the music world like he once was. He’s on the verge of making a deal to buy back Stackin’ Hits, which David intends to continue the work he’s done for black culture.  \r\n\r\nBut the deal goes sideways when David’s son, Trey, is kidnapped, or so they think. Trey comes home safe, but his friend Kyle (Elijah Wright) is taken by mistake. Kyle is David’s godson, and his father, Paul (Jeffrey Wright), works for David and is treated like his brother. The kidnapper (ASAP Rocky, aka Rakim Mayers) knows this, but still wants David to pay a $17.5 million ransom for Kyle.\r\n\r\nNow David must choose between making a financial deal that means so much to him or saving someone who isn’t his son with nearly every dollar his family has to their name.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue of Highest 2 Lowest is so good. Alan Fox is credited for writing the screenplay, even though Spike Lee re-wrote some aspects of it after Denzel Washington joined the cast. But conversations have a natural flow to them with genuine dialogue that feels grounded in reality.\r\n\r\nThe strong performances help with that, as well. Jeffrey Wright is superb as Paul, a concerned father who will stop at nothing to get his son back. Paul has a troubled past that he’s distanced himself from, but also allows him to have connections to things he probably shouldn’t. You sympathize with Paul more than anyone else in the film because he only has one motive, and it isn’t conflicted at all.\r\n\r\nDenzel Washington is in top form, though. He claims to be retiring in the next few years as an actor, which is deserved since he’s 70 now. But he’s also delivered some of his best performances in the last few years. He was the best (and only good) part of Gladiator II. David King has a lot of layers to him as a character, though. He’s selfish and cold, but his family and those close to him, including his business partner Patrick (Michael Potts), remind him that life isn’t all business and money.\r\n\r\nWashington’s performance is as complex as the character. You can tell that he knows what the right thing to do is, but he puts himself through turmoil getting to the point of being that decent person. There’s a sequence near the end of the film where Washington is flowing and throwing down bars like it’s nothing. As David King he claims he’s no musician or rapper, but he does more than a passing job here.\r\n\r\nASAP Rocky is not a great actor. He doesn’t necessarily have to be with his role in the film, but anything outside of acting like an entitled up-and-coming music artist with a chip on his shoulder is strained and less than satisfactory. He gets into a fist fight with Denzel Washington on the subway, where Washington seemingly carries him through the choreography (there are stunt doubles listed in the cast for ASAP Rocky, but not Washington). Rocky also does this annoying grunt repeatedly during this sequence that gets on your last nerve.\r\n\r\nAs a neo-noir crime thriller, Highest 2 Lowest is more interesting in the first half of the film. The story is far more intriguing when David King is mulling over whether or not he should pay the ransom since Kyle isn’t of blood relation to him. Once David decides to pay the ransom, Highest 2 Lowest has predictable storytelling. That decision seems to come out of nowhere, too. One minute, David is telling Detective Earl Bridges (John Douglas Thompson) to keep negotiating because he won’t even consider telling the kidnapper that he’d pay the ransom over the phone, and the very next scene, David is coming into the room with his family to tell Paul they’re bringing Kyle home.\r\n\r\nThe best part after that is the subway sequence, where David is bringing the ransom money to the kidnapper because it’s quite elaborate for a motorcycle handoff. It feels like the story goes through foreseeable interactions after that: David pays the ransom, they lose the money, Kyle is found, they try to find the money, and things work out in the end.\r\n\r\nSpike Lee chooses to focus on music and black culture in Highest 2 Lowest, and it works for the most part. There are at least three full-length music videos in the film (the opening, David’s final interaction with the kidnapper, and the Aiyana-Lee/Sula performance at the end of the film). Music factoring into the actual story is a more intriguing aspect of the film. The characters in the film are driven by music more than anything, and it gets in the way at times. Music comes before logic at times, and it makes sense for character motivation.\r\n\r\nThe use of music is executed beautifully; the opening of the film featuring Norm Lewis’ “Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin’” with what looks like drone footage of early morning traffic and the sun rising on what is the closest thing to slumber of the city that never sleeps features incredible cinematography. ASAP Rocky’s contributions to the soundtrack are solid, and the Highest 2 Lowest title track at the end of the film will give you goosebumps.\r\n\r\nHighest 2 Lowest features an unprecedented performance from Denzel Washington, impressive cinematography, and fantastic music. However, the story is so shackled to safe and expected circumstances that it tethers the film to certain mediocrity.",

  "content": "Director Spike Lee is known for having made his share of fine films (“Do the Right Thing” (1989), “Malcolm X” (1992), “She’s Gotta Have It” (1986), “BlacKkKlansman” (2018) and “Da 5 Bloods” (2020), among others), as well as his share of misfires (“Chi-Raq” (2015), “Red Hook Summer” (2012) and “Bamboozled” (2000), to name a few), but rarely do his pictures fall squarely in the largely indistinguishable middle. Such is the case, however, with the filmmaker’s latest outing, a reinterpretation of the 1963 Akira Kurosawa Japanese crime thriller, “High and Low” (“Tengoku to jigoku”), a remake admittedly being a somewhat unusual production choice for this storied auteur. This is by no means a bad offering, but it is a puzzling one that is largely difficult to categorize. “Highest 2 Lowest” follows the story of David King (Denzel Washington), a successful New York City music mogul said to have “the best ears in the business.” However. when on the brink of closing a deal to revive his sagging recording company, he’s suddenly distracted by the apparent kidnapping of his 17-year-old son, Trey (Aubrey Joseph), whose release carries a $17.5 million ransom demand, an amount essentially equal to what he would need to complete his pending business transaction. Matters become further complicated when David learns that the criminals have not kidnapped Trey but have instead erroneously nabbed the teenage son (Elijah Wright) of his longtime friend, Paul Christopher (Jeffrey Wright), an ex-con who works as his driver, associate and confidante. This leaves David with the question, should he pay the ransom for someone who isn’t his son? Will doing so prevent the deal from proceeding? And what kind of public fallout would he experience if he declines to do so? Such are the dilemmas he must address and the outcomes they could bring. However, while this story thread makes up the core of the film’s narrative, it’s not especially well executed in terms of writing, editing and the performances. With that said, though, the picture nevertheless succeeds brilliantly in other ways, most notably in terms of its articulate statement about the state of current support for the arts and culture in the African-American community, particularly when it comes to funding efforts that are genuinely deserving of financial backing versus those artistically underwhelming projects that are rewarded merely for their commercial viability. This is perhaps best reflected in a performance of the picture’s inspiring title song, a composition truly worthy of serious consideration for an Academy Award in the upcoming best original song competition (an Oscar category to which I usually devote little attention). What’s more, it’s commendable that Lee makes his point on this score without resorting to his often-used tactic of angrily screaming at the audience and browbeating viewers into submission, a most refreshingly welcome deviation to his usual style of filmmaking (a change that I hope he employs more frequently going forward). When all of these diverse attributes are considered collectively, however, it’s not entirely clear precisely what the filmmaker was going for in the first place, which is why it’s a release best relegated to the artistic middle ground of his filmography. Indeed, there are sincerely noteworthy elements in place here, but there are also others that could stand some work, a mixed outcome I typically don’t expect from this director. In that sense, then, it could be said that the picture has a most fitting title to describe its content, even though it’s a somewhat disappointing result from a filmmaker from whom I generally expect better.",

  "content": "_Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets_ is a worthy sequel that improves upon the first and expands the lore in a grand way.\r\n\r\nThe quality in this film is vastly superior to the first in terms of CGI and acting, which is par for the course as the main trio grows into their roles and as actors. It is evident that the CGI team had adequate time before this film's release because for 2002 the effects are spectacular. From Dobby the Elf to the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets, this movie nails creature models and creates very believable interactions between the models and the actors.\r\n\r\nDespite this film not having the impact in terms of discovering the magical world of Hogwarts for the first time, the story is able to improve upon its predecessor delivering an all-around stronger plot. There is a real sense of mystery surrounding the Chamber of Secrets and the suspense and hysteria it creates around Hogwarts is very intriguing. The stakes and the plot progression feel elevated here, creating a more seamless experience.\r\n\r\nLike previously stated, the main casts acting is improved drastically. Each actor is coming into their own and really is getting comfortable with their character. Rupert Grint steals the show with his comedic timing and cowardly presence. Emma Watson is great again but does not carry the entire trio like she had to in the previous film. There are plenty of new additions this time around and all of them were splendid. I particularly liked Dobby and Gilderoy Lockhart.\r\n\r\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets improves upon the first in almost every aspect, and that is all you can ask for a sequel.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _79%_ | \r\n**Verdict:** _Great_",

  "content": "It's cinema Jim, but not as we know it. \r\n\r\nSo here it is then, what has been in gestation in James Cameron's mind for over 12 years finally hit the silver screen towards the back end of 2009. Made for gazillions amount of cash, Avatar went on to make a billion trillion in Worldwide receipts-and this before the rush rush release of DVD/BLU RAY sales are factored into the equation. The film, and all its technical wizardry, is quite simply a gargantuan piece of cinematic history. Released in 2d and 3d, and probably some other format that I'm forgetting, every advanced tool of the trade has been utilised by Cameron and his team to create what is now the ultimate popcorn blockbuster. Shame then, that away from the visual extravaganza the film is as shallow as this review will ultimately end up being.\r\n\r\nNo doubt about it, this is a joy for the eyes and ears, the minuscule details are wonderful and the colour positively pings from every frame. But in the eagerness to create such splendour they forgot to put any substance into the writing. This is plot simplicity. And even its messages, as Cameron smugly preaches his sermon from the pulpit, now seem old hat. Do we really need another boink over the head about eco invasion? Or a curt reminder of American infiltration into some land where motives are suspicious at best? No we don't really do we? Worse still is some of the dialogue, which quite frankly could have come from some playground encounter as the kiddies play kiss chase or bang bang your dead army. There's also a sense of familiarity with other better scripted film's, Dances *cough* With *cough* Wolves *cough* It's as if Cameron just knew that narrative structure wasn't as important as having the expensive gimmicks. He's like a modern day William Castle-only with considerably more readies at his disposal.\r\n\r\nThe cast are OK, Zoe Saldana puts a sexy feistiness to her blue alien Neytiri, Sam Worthington keeps the humanistic elements just about above water, while Sigourney Weaver is as ever the consummate professional. But ironically, in a film shimmering bright in 2d & 3d, the characters are all one dimensional. None more so than Stephen \"The Party Crasher\" Lang's Colonel. A man so gruff and gung-ho menacing he really ought to be in Sly Stallone's upcoming testo movie The Expendables. Nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, it won three, for Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, and Best Art Direction. Those were richly deserved. They also tell us all we need to now about Cameron's Behemoth. 5/10",

  "content": "This is another of these films for which I didn't get the memo. It undoubtedly has parallels with the ecological ravaging of Earth by mankind, but for the most part it is just a fairly standard action romance that owes much of it's significance to it being an outstanding technical production. Sam Worthington is \"Jake\", a paraplegic solider who is tasked with assisting on a mission on a distant planet. By way of a bribe, the authorities offer him surgery to restore his mobility if he uses an avatar machine to infiltrate the folks inhabiting the planet \"Pandora\". The more he explores this bright new world, the more he begins to integrate with the people and their beautiful and colourful environment. His affection for \"Neytiri\" (Zoe Saldana) and his gradually developing appreciation of just what his mission is about, sets him up for a serious conflict with the gung-ho militaristic \"Quaritch\" (Stephen Lang). This film is all about corporate greed and an horrendous disregard not just for nature, but for an indigenous population that is though frequently touching, let down by a really mediocre cast, some slightly pontificating dialogue and yes, it is really too long. It is great to look at, the standards of the production mixing reality with animation are outstanding; it's just that the story is just all a bit lightweight.",

When I was immediately coming out of the cinema I was just plainly thinking of it as being solidly good, however the more I think about it the more I had fun with this seventh installment.\r\n\r\nThe plot, or at least the set-up to it, is quite uncreative, as in I feel like so many films - from this series included - have a crew make-up of similar people and similar characteristics/motivations; <em>'Crater'</em> and <em>'I.S.S.'</em> (both very good, don't get me wrong) are recent examples that spring to mind. Happily, though, the rest of the flick makes up for any weakness in that area.\r\n\r\nCailee Spaeny and David Jonsson are the great performers in this, I found them both to be excellent throughout. Two actors I want to see much more of, having already seen them in a few pleasing pictures; e.g. <em>'Civil War'</em> and <em>'Rye Lane'</em>.\r\n\r\nI also liked the sound design and even the jump scares, which I'm not usually a fan of (bit lazy etc.) but there is enough about how they do them here that it works. Those facehuggers remain brilliantly effective, though the xenomorph isn't amazingly utilised - the human version didn't hit for me, felt <em>'I Am Legend'</em>-esque.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it's up there as one of my favourites from the franchise. For me, <em>'Alien'</em> and <em>'Aliens'</em> just narrowly better this, though it's a marginal improvement on (the entertaining) <em>'Alien Resurrection'</em> and it surpasses every other release, in my eyes.",

  "content": "I gather director Fede Alvarez made a conscious - and probably expensive - decision to keep the use of CGI to a minimum here and it really does work. \"Rain\" (Cailee Spaeny) and her \"brother\" are looking to get off-planet but she can't get travel papers from the all-powerful mining company. Desperate, she and \"Andy\" (David Jonsson) are offered a chance by wide boys \"Tyler\" (Archie Renaux) and \"Bjorn\" (Spike Fearn) to raid a decrepit old spacecraft that appears to be in a decaying orbit, so they can pinch it's cryogenic pods and enable them all to escape to another planet out of reach of their enthralling taskmasters. Off they set onto the \"Romulus\" and that's where, well you just know what's going to happen now, as they inadvertently turn the central heating on and find themselves in mortal danger. \"Andy\" just happens to be a synthetic, which proves especially useful when they discover the remains of \"Rook\" (the spitting image of the late Sir Ian Holm) but is this oozing mess of gunge and wiring actually an help or an hindrance? Getting off is going to be a lot harder than getting on! To be honest, the acting here is really neither here nor there. Renaux and Isabella Merced - their cohort \"Kay\" do enough, Fearn rather over-plays his chip-on-the-shoulder character and there's a slightly soporific effort from Jonsson, but that's not what I was watching for. This is all about the best monsters sci-fi cinema has ever created, and right from their first appearance I was in their corner. There's loads of darkly shot menace crammed into the two hours with plenty of references to it's originator and even more insinuations about the greed of a \"company\" that doesn't know when to leave well alone. Just like the other \"Alien\" films, it takes a Russian Doll approach to the ending, so don't think we're going to get off with just the one, definitive, \"get away from her...\" moment, and of course the lift plays a pivotal part in the proceedings as acid blood drips everywhere. It's not so good as the first two Sigourney Weaver outings, but slips neatly into bronze medal position for me in a series that can still prove quite compellingly scary. It's a cinema must - telly just won't do the lighting and photography justice at all.",

That said, haven't we seen it all before, in one form or another? \r\n\r\nIn summary, miscasting combined with a story that blandly apes superior earlier films, leads to an \"okay\" watch that's fails to distinguish itself.If you are new to this franchise, my advice start with Alien from 1979 and then its plural successor Aliens, instead.",

  "content": "Color me thoroughly surprised at how much I was delighted by “Alien: Romulus,” a highly creative, beautifully executed, pulse-pounding science fiction film from director Fede Alvarez. This sequel is a rare gem in the world of big budget franchise flicks because it not only respects its predecessors with thoughtfully well done homages, but also pushes the boundaries of the universe it inhabits with inventive set pieces and a plausible story. Fans of the series and the genre are in for a real treat.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the roots of the “Alien” franchise, the film tells the story of a group of young space colonizers (Cailee Spaeny, David Jonsson, Archie Renaux, Isabela Merced, Aileen Wu, and Spike Fearn)who are looking for a way out of their current situation as hard laborers on a sunless planet. While searching the universe, they encounter a decommissioned ship that has enough supplies to take them far, far away. Intent on scavenging, the group makes a risky voyage into space where they get far more than they bargained for: a face-to-face encounter with a terrifying life form from which they may have no hope of escape.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the story is also in its simplicity, and Alvarez uses swift pacing and straightforward character development to create an irresistible hook for audiences. He creates a crackerjack blend of suspense, horror, and science fiction that not only hearkens back to the original films, but also offers up something fresh and modernized for a new generation. Even better, the film is very dark and isn’t dumbed down for casual viewers, which shows a great deal of respect to long-time sci-fi fans. This isn’t just another sequel that is exploiting a franchise’s good will, it actually has some substance.\r\n\r\nThere’s an atmosphere of dread that commands most of the movie, and the action scenes are imaginative and inspired. I was on the edge of my seat multiple times, and several of the set pieces are visually fun, too. The special effects are not flashy or over-polished like the ones that tend to dominate modern blockbusters (even the alien creature itself remains largely unchanged from its original, iconic 1979 design), which turns out to be the perfect complement to the film’s strong narrative foundation. Heightened tension and fear is created through well-crafted suspense rather than constant visual bombardment. There’s a level of sophistication here that elevates it beyond a mere retread of past “Alien” films.\r\n\r\nI was especially surprised about how quickly I started to care about the characters, who don’t exactly give off the best first impression (they seem like they will be stereotypical and highly annoying, but that’s not the case). As the story unfolds, so do the layers of depth and complexity, both which make the fate of these friends matter. The film is well cast, and Spaeny’s versatility shines through in a role that requires both emotional range and physical intensity.\r\n\r\nThe film is willing to take risks, especially when it comes to killing off characters. The unpredictability of who will survive and who has the wits to escape from harrowing situations adds another layer of tension and sense of danger. Nothing here feels preordained, and that in itself is exciting.\r\n\r\n“Alien: Romulus” is a wildly satisfying addition to the franchise because it’s a film that understands what made the original great and uses those elements to create something new and exciting. It succeeds in paying homage to its predecessors while also forging its own identity, honoring its legacy in a way that will have sci-fi nerds salivating for future installments.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

  "content": "Alien: Romulus is a love letter to the 1979 classic, and while I dug the whole philosophical space-god thing in Prometheus, this stripped-down, back-to-basics approach had me hooked from the first frame.  It's been a while since an Alien film truly captured that sense of claustrophobic dread, and Romulus nails it.\r\n\r\nThis movie is gorgeous, plain and simple. The lighting, the camera angles, and Benjamin Wallfisch's score – it all blends together to create this constant tension that just sucks you in. There's this one scene where Rain, Andy and Tyler are being chased through the research station, the way they use the shadows and movement, it's like a masterclass in suspense. It totally reminded me of the most terrifying moments from the original. It's obvious Álvarez was obsessed with recreating that gritty, lived-in feel of the first Alien, and it pays off big time.\r\n\r\nThe cast is solid too. Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson absolutely kill it as Rain and Andy.  I'll admit, I was worried Andy would be your typical forgettable sidekick, but he actually gets a pretty interesting arc.  Sure, most of the crew are basically there to get picked off by the Xenomorph, but Andy was a standout supporting character. He basically played two roles. It's refreshing that the movie doesn't waste time with a bunch of unnecessary characters.\r\n\r\nOne thing this movie does really well is finding that sweet spot between horror and action that made the first two films so iconic.  Alien 3 was so bleak, and Resurrection was just bonkers action – this one feels like a proper blend of both.  Fede Álvarez basically throws in all the best Alien tropes: the ragtag crew, the creepy body horror stuff, the tense hide-and-seek scenes, and some kickass action sequences. And you know what? It totally works.\r\n\r\nI was impressed at a lot of the creative set pieces and how they built tension. Like how they played with gravity to avoid the acid and trying to sneak past the facehuggers by camoflaging their body temperature. They were really cool and shockingly unique and fresh for a nearly 50 old franchise. And let's talk about that body horror. There's this one scene, a seriously messed-up vaginal birth, that is going to be burned into my brain for a while. Álvarez definitely gets what makes this franchise tick.\r\n\r\nI'm giving Alien: Romulus a strong 7/10.  It lost some points for the use of the CGI Ian Holm. It's so distracting, and they rely on it way too much.  Also, there some lines that were stuck in there for nostalgia that felt out of place.  But honestly, those are minor nitpicks in a movie that's this much fun. The whole final act, with the station crashing into the asteroid field and that epic showdown with the Human/ Xeno, is just pure chaos in the best way possible.\r\n\r\nAlien: Romulus is a worthy successor to the Alien throne. It's a visual treat, a thrilling ride, and a damn good reminder of why we love this franchise in the first place.",

It didn't try to be edgy or special - it seems to be directed by a guy who loved the first 2 Alien movies from the 80ies and wanted to add a movie as best as he could do in our time which is still faithful to those 2 original movies and could be considered a worthy addition to the original \"Alien\" storyline.\r\n\r\nThe acting was overall very good. Cailee Spaeny as the lead actress gave a solid performance as expected. But the surprise of the movie was David Jonsson as her android \"brother\", who was the highlight of the movie actingwise for me.\r\n\r\nAnother main thing to mention are the effects and set desing. A lot of great practical effects, lighting and cinematography and the set design which is faithful to that of the first 2 Alien movies make this movie a great enjoyment for anyone who like the.\r\n\r\nSo, if you love the first 2 Alien movies - this movie is for you!",

  "content": "And so all good things come to an end. For three years in a row, Peter Jackson has banished our winter blues with the individual instalments of his Tolkien trilogy, effectively shifting the focus of our cinematic excitement from the summer months to the end of the year. But now that his epic has been unveiled in its entirety, what will be the lasting effects of his achievement?\r\n\r\nWell, grand-scale fantasy filmmaking is back on the menu, laying down the gauntlet to George Lucas and Star Wars Episode III. Jackson has also proved that notions of risk and ambition needn't be confined to the low-budget, indie end of the spectrum; nor does California have an exclusive stranglehold on groundbreaking special effects.\r\n\r\nAnd then there's the DVD factor. Just as The Lord Of The Rings was upping the stakes in theatres, so too was its DVD release pattern defining what can (and should) be done on disc for major movies.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the four-disc extended editions seem to have affected the director's thinking as to what he can get away with in his theatrical final cut. Hence the public grumbles from Christopher Lee about the non-appearance of Saruman in this final instalment. While it might have been fair to grant Lee a curtain call, Jackson quite rightly realises that it is Sauron, not Saruman, whose fiery eye encompasses all the narrative strands of the climax.\r\n\r\nThe Return Of The King marks the first time in the series when Jackson's roots as a horror filmmaker creep through. As the orcs catapult severed Gondorian heads beyond the walls of Minas Tirith, flesh-rotted ghosts draw swords alongside Aragorn and giant spider Shelob stalks Frodo through dark, web-shrouded tunnels, the film pushes the boundaries of its 12A certificate.\r\n\r\nAnd so it should, because the look and tone must necessarily grow darker as the Hobbits near Mount Doom and Mordor's evil hand grips Middle-earth ever tighter.\r\n\r\nCharacter nuances have been crafted over an unprecedented ten hours-plus of cinematic storytelling: from Strider lurking in the shadowy corner to Aragorn rallying the troops; from Merry and Pippin as bumbling fools to stout-hearted, pint-sized warriors. Only Legolas and Gimli seem to have regressed (in screen time at least) to set-piece archer and comedy sidekick respectively. At least Andy Serkis is rewarded for his Gollum voice work with an early flashback that gets his face on screen, as well as warning us that, under the ring's power, Smeagol can be as murderous as Gollum.\r\n\r\nJackson has kept the momentum of the series rolling on and on though the traditionally 'difficult' middle part and 'weak' finale, delivering a climax to the story that's neater and more affecting than what Tolkien managed on the printed page. Some viewers might feel that the director sprinkles some cheese on his extended coda, adding at least one false ending too many (even if he does ignore the book's Scouring of The Shire).\r\n\r\nBut those who have walked beside these heroes every step of the way on such a long journey deserve the emotional pay-off as well as the action peaks, and they will be genuinely touched as the final credits roll. Yes, the Ring is dead. Long live King Kong.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict - The resounding climax to a landmark in cinema history. But the King has now returned, the story is over and the ships are leaving Middle-earth. Ladies and gentlemen, Elvish has left the building.\r\n\r\n5/5\r\n\r\n- Alan Morrison, Empire Magazine",

  "content": "Too much CGI, redundancy, clichés and drawn out “looks of love” for my tastes.\r\n\r\nRELEASED 2003 and directed by Peter Jackson, “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King” adapts the third part of JRR Tolkien’s popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth: Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin) and Gollum (Andy Serkis) continue to try to make their way to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Meanwhile Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom), Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies), Gandalf the wizard (Ian McKellen), King Theoden (Bernard Hill) and Faramir (David Wenham) join forces to fight Sauron's army at the stone city of Minas Tirith and, later, draw the forces of Modor out as a distraction for Frodo to accomplish his goal. Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan are on hand as Hobbits Pippin and Merry.        \r\n\r\nWhile I’m a casual fantasy/adventure fan and have read numerous books of the genre (e.g. Conan, Tarzan, Gor, etc.), I’ve never read Tokien, likely because I’m not into Hobbits, Elves and Dwarfs. After viewing the three movies, The Lord of the Rings strikes me as a mixture of Robin Hood, Conan and The Wizard of Oz, which all possibly influenced Tolkien’s writing of the Rings trilogy in 1937-1949. So, if you think a meshing of “Conan the Barbarian” (1982) and “Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves” (1991) with “The Wizard of Oz” (1939) sounds good, then you’ll probably like these movies more than me. \r\n\r\n“The Return of the King” is just more of the same showcased in the first two movies, but even LONGER. Take the Battle of Minas Tirith, for example. It’s basically the same as The Battle at Helms Deep in the previous movie, except with colossal elephant-like creatures and the Army of the Dead. These two battles are similar enough that they could’ve been condensed into one conflict. Speaking of the Army of the Dead, this was an interesting new element, as was the horrifying spider-monster that Frodo & Sam face inside the caves.   \r\n\r\nLike the first two movies, the characters are diverse, the tale is creative, there’s a lot of dark action rounded out by softer scenes and everything LOOKS and SOUNDS magnificent. Unfortunately, as with “The Two Towers,” there’s excessive use of CGI (aka CGI porn). If cartoony CGI is your thang then you’ll likely appreciate this installment more than me.        \r\n\r\nThere are other problems: While the characters are inspired, they’re also thin and rather uninteresting, at least for mature people who require more depth to hold their attention. Take Legolas (Bloom), for example; we never get to know him. Or consider Aragorn: Mortensen is perfect as the noble warrior, but in the ENTIRE trilogy he probably only has like two full pages of dialog, maybe three. Also, I found the story generally disengaging. I was never much enthralled by the characters and their pursuits, although devotees of Tolkien might be. \r\n\r\nThen there are WAY too many “looks of love” between characters, particularly Frodo and Sam (I was so happy to see one character get married and have kids, if you catch my drift). There’s also a sense of redundancy, like the aforementioned battles (Helms Deep and Minas Tirith). Or consider the hokey dangling from a cliff by one’s fingers: This was already done with Gandalf at the end of the first part and beginning of the next. Did we really need the entire trilogy to come down to this type of eye-rolling cliché?    \r\n\r\nAnother problem is the lack of feminine protagonists. There’s Miranda Otto as Éowyn, Théoden's niece, who becomes infatuated with Aragorn and masquerades as a warrior-ess. Other than that all we have are cameos by Liv Tyler (Arwen), Cate Blanchett (Galadriel) and a Hobbit’s wife. “Mythica: A Quest for Heroes” (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $94 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the creators knew enough to throw in a couple of prominent babes as heroines in the story. So did “Conan the Barbarian” and “Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God” (2005). It’s not rocket science. \r\n\r\nAs noted above, the movie’s needlessly overlong and things could’ve been condensed in the trilogy or omitted altogether. When the main storyline ultimately ends at Mount Doom I was thinking there was maybe 12-15 minutes left with half of that time being credits. Nope, there was STILL 30 MINUTES LEFT wherein boring goodbyes and “looks of love” are tacked on. \r\n\r\nDespite these honest quibbles, “The Return of the King,” and the trilogy in general, was an ultra-ambitious undertaking and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados, particularly those who favor Tolkien, Hobbits, Elves, Gnomes and the like.                      \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 3 hours 21 minutes and was shot in New Zealand.  \r\n\r\nGRADE: C",

  "content": "An outstanding end to the trilogy.\r\n\r\nI expected a lot from <em>'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'</em> so I am delighted to see it produce on so many levels. I, funnily enough, wouldn't actually say it's necessarily the most perfect execution - what with the plot coincidences and extreme character armour. But that doesn't matter one jot whatsoever, as the story wraps up in arguably the best way - at least to watch - possible. It has so much heart and feeling to it.\r\n\r\nThe story involving the characters of Elijah Wood, Sean Astin and Andy Serkis remained the most interesting to me, I was very satisfied with how it concluded in regards to them. I also enjoyed the bits we got of Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen & Co. All that added to the beautiful look and creation of the film, with the world coming alive splendidly.\r\n\r\nIf I were to nit-pick further, I would say the run time is slightly too long. The pacing is absolutely fine, very good in fact, but I coulda done without a few of the many end scenes - a lot of which are necessary and welcome, but a couple could've been left out to allow the viewer to imagine how the world continued. That's just how I feel mind, I'm sure I'm one of only a few that think that way.\r\n\r\nBack onto the positives: how about those battle sequences? Astonishingly good. A sensational trilogy, no question about it. I look forward to seeing <em>'The Hobbit'</em> films.",

  "content": "As an avid fan of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings from long before New Line announced this movie \"trilogy,\" I must say all three films were fairly large disappointments.  Now, mind you, I am not your usual, \"The book is better\" movie reviewer.  But it is almost like Peter Jackson went out of his way to take out the most crucial elements of the books and replace it with drivel.  Also every line that sounds even remotely cool in the books must be given to Gandalf, no matter who actually said it...  That's just frustrating, despite Sir Ian McKellen's stellar performance.  With what I would hope is the obvious exception of Orlando Bloom's third dismal performance as Legolas, the actors all did quite well; the characters were just not allowed to shine as they do in the books.\r\n\r\nI see that the common consensus is that this movie is too long, and I agree.  What's most frustrating about that to me is that this movie had to finish The Two Towers since that film did not complete, and then this film left out the pivotal ending of the saga.  The Return of the King is actually the shortest volume of the three (there are six books, two in each volume).  As some have noted, the film noticeably scraps the scouring of the Shire, but for those who might have hoped for a fourth installment to finish that story, Peter Jackson dashed all hopes by disturbingly killing off Saruman at the beginning of the extended edition.  By the by, I understand many people feel that the scouring of the Shire is anticlimactic after the final defeat of Sauron, but for myself, I think the point that there is still evil in the world, and that heroes must still rise to fight it, is one of Tolkien's triumphs.  Back to my main point, though: the books were shorter while telling more story, because despite his depth and detail, Tolkien understood how to drive  a story along.  Peter Jackson, on the other hand, fails on that count.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I am someone who always hoped that these movies would be made (I grew up watching the animations produced by Rankin/Bass and Fantasy Films).  But now I suppose I'll have to wait until someone is daring enough to try again, despite the overwhelming success of these films (which will probably not happen in my lifetime).  In the meantime, I'll continue to read the books every year.",

  "content": "I've just seen this on the big screen for the first time since I saw it at London's sadly now long-gone Odeon at Marble Arch, which - at the time - boasted the biggest screen in the UK, and it has lost little of it's magic. Continuing with the interwoven tales of \"Frodo\", \"Sam\" and their treacherous guide \"Gollum\" as they trek through fire and brimstone to get the ring to Mount Doom; whilst Gandalf, Aragorn and the surviving members of the fellowship try to stem the might of \"Sauron\" and his armies of orcs and their allies. While this is undoubtedly a magnificent piece of cinema, I find the story drags a bit. I found the the focus to be too much on the less interesting characters - the lovelorn \"Eowyn\" (Miranda Otto); the delusional \"Denethor\" (John Noble) and decent but rather wimpish \"Faramir\" (David Wenham) as \"Gondor\" faces the wrath of their nemesis, and that slows the pace from the action just when it ought to be building. The delightful, friendly, rivalry between \"Gimli\" & \"Legolas\" features all too sparingly and it's got too ponderous a narrative to sustain the four hours the otherwise visionary Peter Jackson has created. Fortunately, the triple-header quest with Elijah Wood, Sean Astin and a superb Andy Serkis keep the other strand moving along suspensefully and tensely. The battle scenes are superb, though - when we get them, the effects really do rise to the occasion and, of course, the striking cinematography coupled with the inspired themes from Howard Shore contribute to a thoroughly entertaining adaptation of a thoroughly captivating fantasy adventure. If you make it past the start of the credits, there is the gloriously haunting \"Into the West\" from Annie Lennox to top off this finest of trilogies. The Oscar/BAFTA awards this achieved are a just reward for years of stunningly creative effort from thousands of people who turned the imagination of a 20th Century English academic into films that will last forever.",

  "content": "Based on the 2020 novel of the same name by Adam Cesare, Clown in a Cornfield follows 17-year-old Quinn Maybrook (Katie Douglas) and her father (Aaron Abrams) moving to Kettle Springs, Missouri. After the passing of Quinn’s mother the previous summer, Kettle Springs had an opening for a family doctor which caused the surviving Maybrooks to move from the big city to a small rural town.\r\n\r\nThe local corn syrup factory burned down recently and its mascot, a clown named Frendo, has become a celebratory icon for Kettle Springs. With a town holiday known as Founders Day fast approaching, the townsfolk are noticeably on edge with new people moving in and the younger generation making dreaded internet videos.\r\n\r\nAs Quinn tries to make friends in a town she never wanted to move to, an actual killing spree by someone wearing a clown costume drenches Kettle Springs in a sea of blood.\r\n\r\nThe clown sequences in Clown in a Cornfield are the film's highlights. Interestingly, a jack-in-the-box toy pops up whenever someone is about to die prompting you to think of a connection or deeper meaning to Frendo that never actually occurs. But some of the kills are incredibly solid like the gnarly chainsaw kill in the middle of the cornfield, the barbell kill you see glimpses of in the trailer, and a brutal pitchfork sequence that results in two deaths.\r\n\r\nEverything in between teenagers getting slaughtered is rather clunky. Clown in a Cornfield doubles down on this The Breakfast Club meets Dead & Buried ambiance, but never quite gets there. Kettle Springs sees MadTV’s Will Sasso as the town sheriff and it’s bizarre. He plays the role completely straight, but Sheriff Dunne is rather forgettable otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe cast is mostly fine when it comes to passable performances. Katie Douglas slides into her role as Quinn Maybrook more comfortably as the film progresses and as the events in the film become more hectic. Early on in the film, it’s as if Douglas has this permanent pouty face and duck lips expression that is entirely obnoxious.\r\n\r\nKevin Durand is the unexpected delight of the cast though. Durand has always been a supporting actor that is a sleeper hit in whatever he pops up in with Abigail and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes being prime examples. As Arthur Hill, Durand initially comes off as a stereotypical father who is part of a lucrative family that founded the town. But he evolves into something else entirely that is wholly crucial to the circus-themed massacre.\r\n\r\nThe slasher film introduces a blood feud between the older and younger generations. High school students are sneered at, looked down on, and judged for things they didn’t ever do or think about doing. The sheriff seems to make his laws and teachers dish out detention for no reason.\r\n\r\nThere’s a reveal regarding Frendo that transpires roughly halfway through the film that feels like it happens entirely too soon. Co-writer and director Eli Craig (Tucker and Dale vs Evil) and co-writer Carter Blanchard (uncredited screenwriter on Independence Day: Resurgence) could have teased this reveal for far longer. It would have been much more satisfying.\r\n\r\nThe friends that Quinn makes in Kettle Springs are the more popular high school kids but are also the most troublesome. They have a YouTube channel with over 600K subscribers and their content is short horror films featuring one of them dressed as Frendo killing people. It results in this troublesome dynamic where when a clown does start killing people nobody believes them. They don’t even believe it themselves at first even when they start being targeted.\r\n\r\nThere isn’t a ton of humor in Clown in a Cornfield, but at least two instances come to mind that are fairly amusing. The sequence where Quinn and Janet (Cassandra Potenza) don’t know how to operate a rotary phone is classic and it’s a shame that it’s given away in the trailer. Older technology in general like driving a car with a manual transmission is a concept Clown in a Cornfield explores quite a bit.\r\n\r\nThere’s also a moment when two girls are tossing around a severed head like a hot potato because they think it’s fake. They have this bitchy back-and-forth that is very LSP from Adventure Time interacting with a minor inconvenience kind of commentary and it’s fantastic.\r\n\r\nClown in a Cornfield displays moments of coulrophobic greatness. Frendo is a brutal psychopath whose weird devotion to the clown art form (like his big shoes that squeak when he walks during the most tense moments of stalking his prey) attempts to make the audience laugh through the moments of terror.\r\n\r\nThe film is overflowing with palpable teenage energy though. Clown in a Cornfield is based on a young adult novel, so it’s expected but the constant barrage of “adults just don’t understand us” and the nonstop desire to drink themselves stupid at every opportunity becomes predictable and tiresome.\r\n\r\nThe kills are entertaining, but the young versus old debacle and less than surprising Frendo “twist” makes Clown in a Cornfield decent, but not memorable.",

  "content": "Ok, so there’s not much original about this cornfield chopper, but I think that’s the point. It sets itself up right from the start as more of a parody of so many other films of the genre, and I really quite enjoyed it. Of course we have to start with the daughter/father relationship that’s reeling from a tragedy, then they move to an old rickety house that really does need it’s chimney seeing to before she sets of to school dressed for a “Rocky Horror” party. “Quinn” (Katie Douglas) quickly falls in the with the town’s rowdy crowd, led by wealthy eye-candy “Cole” (Carson MacCormac) which just earns her the annoyance of her dad (Aaron Abrams) and just about all of the local bigwigs. This lot like to have a few drinks then make spoof horror films in which they get brutally slain by a clown from the cornfield then post them on the internet. It’s when once such frolic turns out to be just a bit more serious that things get altogether more menacing for our troop of teenagers. What now ensues, well you’ve seen it all before lots of times but this time it’s tongue is in it’s cheek, there’s a (pretty obvious) twist in the romantic tale and the whole enterprise is reminiscent of “Scooby Do” does the “Klu Klux Clown”. There’s plenty of screaming histrionics, chainsaws, crawling through sewers and you could bathe like Cleopatra in the amount of ketchup, or corn syrup, that’s splashed about as it races along. If you’re looking for BAFTA acting skills, then perhaps not, but if you can watch this in the context that it is an entertaining satire of those gone before it, then I think it’s quite good fun and who knows, there might even be a sequel.",

  "content": "I’m guessing that Russell Crowe was busy for this latest exercise in priestly exorcism so an hardly recognisable Al Pacino decided to have a go. He is a Capetian father drafted in to help the reluctant Fr. Joseph (Dan Stevens) with a particularly difficult task. Fr. Theophilus must help rid the poor young Emma (Abigail Cowen) of an unwanted bodily guest. His methods do not impress the rather naive young father, nor the sisters in attendance as she increasingly resorts to involuntary bleeding, foul language, violent outbursts and even the usual hanging upside down from the ceiling lamp trick whilst under relentless assault from the repetitious bible verses being read across what I counted are at least seven of those ritual attempts at expulsion. Sound familiar? Well that’s because it is. Aside from Pacino turning in a slightly different style of performance from his norm, the rest of this hasn’t an original bone in it’s body. Indeed, its only claim to fame appears to be that it is based on the original, almost century old, transcriptions from Fr. Joseph of events that are really supposed to have happened but we’ve seen this all predictably play out so many times before that even the traditional collapsible bed doesn’t turn an head - spiritual or metaphysically. The one element that does provoke a little interest is, perhaps, the clear indication that Catholicism in the 1920s was riddled with incantations, superstitions and a degree of symbolism that probably hadn’t changed since much since there was a Borgia on the throne of St. Peter. This might work on the telly at Halloween of you’re full of Grappa, but as a cinema experience it is disappointing and entirely forgettable, sorry.",

  "content": "I love this movie. It is a brilliant dissection of \"testosterone movies\" in their most basic form. Typically, these films rely on a formulaic group dynamic to add depth to the stoic hero, as seen in the original. When the hero began to show emotion, another stoic figure was introduced to maintain the balance. In this reimagining, the tables have turned.\r\n\r\nThe surrounding cast of characters are formulaic stereotypes, including the dastardly villains. This approach cleverly mirrors the original's tactic but with a twist. For example, the antagonists follow the same pattern: once the main antagonist, Brandt, reveals any emotion, it is perceived as weakness, prompting the introduction of a more intense and hyper-masculine antagonist, Knox. This shift highlights the film's commentary on the traditional portrayal of strength and vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThe protagonist, Dalton, adds unexpected layers to the story. Unlike the typical stoic hero, Dalton displays mental health struggles and other vulnerabilities, making him a more complex and relatable character. He is constantly conflicted and fighting his inner demons, much like Knox, but he strives to control his wild and reckless tendencies. For example, Dalton's struggle with his darker impulses is poignantly depicted in scenes where he battles both external foes and his internal conflicts, showcasing his depth and humanity.\r\n\r\nThis modern-day Western with a twist offers a fresh perspective on the concepts of heroes and villains. By the end, the film delivers a new message that challenges traditional notions of heroism and villainy. The nuanced portrayal of Dalton's character and his journey towards self-acceptance and control provides a thought-provoking narrative. For instance, the climax where Dalton must confront his own nature and make a crucial decision encapsulates the film's theme of inner strength and redemption.\r\n\r\nOverall, this movie stands out for its innovative take on a familiar genre. It successfully deconstructs the typical testosterone-fueled narrative by focusing on the protagonist's vulnerabilities and internal struggles. This fresh approach not only adds depth to the characters but also redefines the genre's conventions. I would love to see more stories told in this manner, offering new perspectives and challenging traditional narratives.",

  "content": "Director Doug Liman’s “Road House” is a wild ride of fightin’, spittin’, cussin’, and bone snappin’, a testosterone-fueled muscle movie that’s perfect for a weekend stream. Taking a more dramatic angle with a drug and crime story, this re-imagining of the 80s cult classic still delivers plenty of action and entertainment, even if it lacks in originality and substance.\r\n\r\nTrouble is brewing at a Florida Keys roadhouse, and proprieter Frankie (Jessica Williams) is desperate for some old fashioned law and order. The local police won’t help, so Frankie seeks out ex-UFC fighter Dalton (Jake Gyllenhaal) for the job. Down on his luck, he agrees to take the well paying gig in paradise. When he arrives, Dalton discovers that he’s stepped into a criminal underworld that’s darker and more serious than anticipated. One by one, he outsmarts and out muscles the seemingly endless line of bad guys that stand in his way.\r\n\r\nThe film works well because of its willingness to embrace its own over-the-top absurdity. Gyllenhaal plays Dalton with an authentic, rugged charm, taking his character seriously, but not overly so. He’s believable as a tough guy for hire who “hurts people for money,” and he lends a pedigree to an otherwise mindless piece of entertainment.\r\n\r\nConor McGregor is a lot of fun in his supporting role as Knox a worthy adversary to Dalton. Insane and unhinged, he feels like a ripoff of the Jason Momoa character Dante in “Fast X,” minus a bit of charm and acting talent.\r\n\r\nThe movie is over-the-top in a lot of ways, but the one thing that really bugged me is that early on, there’s a casual mention of a killer crocodile. This caused my mind to wander the whole movie, just waiting on the edge of my seat for Dalton to wrassle it (spoiler alert: I was so disappointed).\r\n\r\nThat’s not to say the movie isn’t corny, because it is. Those little touches of humor, the charismatic lead, brawny action sequences, and nods to classic muscle movies also make it wildly entertaining.\r\n\r\nLet me put it this way: “Road House” ends with a clear set-up for a sequel that I wouldn’t necessarily be excited to see, but I’d definitely be first in line to buy a ticket.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

  "content": "Do not do so lightly! If chosen, there's no turning back. As from this moment, The Triwizard Tournament has begun!\r\n\r\nYear four at Hogwarts for Harry Potter and his chums, and it's a time of change, chance and danger. The prestigious Triwizard Tournament is being hosted and the applecart is turned upside down when Harry, unqualified and underage, is selected by the Goblet of Fire to be one of Hogwarts' competitors. If the thought of competing in such a dangerous tournament wasn't scary enough, Harry also has the worry of finding a date for the Yule Ball to contend with! \r\n\r\nThe Prisoner of Azkaban set the marker for a darker, more grown up Potter picture, a high standard that Goblet of Fire, and new director Mike Newell, arguably had no hope of attaining. But it's not for lack of trying, and in fairness Newell and the team have managed well enough to blend the blackness that comes with the impending arrival of Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes), with the burgeoning ping of teenager hormones. There's an awful lot going on here. With the Triwizard Tournament comes two groups of exchange students to Hogwarts in the form of the glamorous girls of Beauxbatons Academy, and the hunky boys of Durmstrang Institute. The arrival of which sends Ron, Hermione and co into blushy flustered awakenings. The tournament itself (rightly) dominates much of the film, the lead up to it and the three challenges that the competitors have to face, with Harry's dragon face off a bona fide excellent piece of film. Then on to the fall out of the tournament where it gets real dark and the film and series lurch on to another level and set up the next installment a treat. \r\n\r\nAs is customary for a Potter film, there's also a number of new characters and replaced characters in the mix, while major story developments flit in and out of the narrative to the point you really have to pay attention completely. Of the new arrivals it's Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody (Brendan Gleeson terrific) who is most telling and enjoyable, but tabloid scribe Rita Skeeter (Miranda Richardson) is something the film could have survived without. Yes it's a nice pop at the gutter press, but watching it now, would the time spent wasted on Skeeter not have been better served on the sadly under filmed Quidditch World Cup? Especially considering the build up to it is magnificent. Or at the very least some more Malfoy Senior, Sirius or Snape! But the disappointment felt there is offset some by the wonderful Yule Ball, where Newell is in his element gleefully dangling his charges through the joys and sorrows of awkward awakenings. It's a series highlight that's not to be missed.\r\n\r\nA film of variable pace due to the makers trying to juggle so much, it's ultimately something of an up and down viewing experience. That said, Newell is able to dazzle the pre-teens with his set pieces, because the kiddies sure as hell will not understand the angst and hormonal issues present, while the rest plays out on adult terms. So something for everyone, then. It may not be successful as a whole, and newcomers dipping in for the first time get no guidance at all, but it's still a ripper of a ride for those who are into the films having not read the books. It's set up nicely for part 5, but pity poor David Yates in the directing chair for Order of the Phoenix, though, for that is one hell of a door stopper novel to try and condense down into an entertaining Potter movie! 7/10",

  "content": "_Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire_ is an absolute spectacle. I am a huge sucker for tournaments in films and this hit every single note for me; intensity, stakes, creativity, it is all there.\r\n\r\nOur main cast is doing some of the best acting of the series, Daniel Radcliffe really raises his performance up a notch and establishes himself as the lead of the franchise. His acting is refined and mature and he does an excellent job portraying his emotions with not only his line delivery but his facial expressions and body language. He really broke through here and it was a joy to see. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were great, but they had a slight decrease in screentime and really were sidelined during this film. The introduction of Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory brings an interesting dynamic to the story, as Harry Potter has somewhat of an older brother figure to contend with. The relationship and chemistry between the two builds and brings some emotionally heavy scenes throughout.\r\n\r\nThere is constant action in this film; from the opening scenes of the Quidditch World Cup to the multiple rounds of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, there is always something happening, and it helps create a very steady pace throughout. Not only is there action, but there is also fantastic character development. All of our characters really start to come into their own through the struggles they all face throughout the film. Harry is the best he's ever been, and the new faces are great on screen. Alastor Moody is mysterious and quirky and is a great mentor to Harry.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest thing about this film is the sinster introduction of Lord Voldemort. His presence was lurking in the background of the entire series, but here he is reborn in a horrifying way. Ralph Feinnes is superb in his only 6 minutes of screen time, but it is enough to leave a lasting impression. The ending is perfect and sets the tone of the franchise going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the cinematography and tone might be better in Prisoner of Azkaban, I cannot deny that this movie is better in almost every other aspect, which is why it gets a slight nod.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _89%_ | \r\n**Verdict:** _Excellent_",

  "content": "Possibly the weakest of the series, this one, for me. Our trio start by visiting the Quidditch World Cup which is invaded by the evil \"Death Eaters\" who reduce everything to ashes in their search for \"Harry\". Shortly afterwards, the \"Tri-Wizard Cup\" comes to Hogwarts - a good excuse to introduce some new characters amongst them Frances de la Tour as the enormous \"Madame Maxime\" and Roger Lloyd-Pack as \"Barty Crouch\" as each school chooses their champion to take part in the potentially lethal games. \"Hogwarts\" chooses \"Cedric Diggory\" (Robert Pattinson) but the goblet also chooses our \"Harry\" and so four go into the competition. As this description, so far, probably indicates - there is an hell of a lot going on here and not surprisingly the adaptation to the screenplay starts to leave out detail and characterisation. To do the story justice, it ought to have been two films - we spend way too long establishing and when we get to the climax, it all seems a bit too rushed. Mike Newell simply has to squeeze too many, important, interweaving themes into 2½ hours and it doesn't quite work. It is still a great fantasy adventure building well on the now well-established characters and putting more meat on the bones of the \"Harry Potter\" character.",

It's like the love it garnered on release and the colossal waves it made in the history of cinema, never happened, or as some want you to believe, doesn't matter. I can tell you now that many of my macho fuelled friends will privately, under the influence of liquid refreshments, admit to having affection for the film, but socially in a circle environment? Not a bit of it! I have no such problems admitting my love for the film, I love it as much now as I approach 50, as I did when I sat there in awe at the cinema in 1997.\r\n\r\nYou jump - I jump.\r\n\r\nTitanic is far from flawless, where even now with the advancements in technology the effects over 15 years later look a touch creaky. While it's true as well that away from Rose and Jack the characterisations are thin on the ground. But this is Rose and Jack's story, fully fleshed out for an hour and half and then framed by the terrible tragedy that unfolds for the next hour and half. The tie-in to the present day is superbly constructed by James Cameron - the search for the diamond - the real life filming of the Titanic wreckage - and the flashback telling of the story by a delightful Gloria Stuart as old Rose, and the sinking of the ship and its aftermath is stunning and heart breaking in equal measure.\r\n\r\nNever let go.\r\n\r\nSo may scenes and dialogue exchanges stay in the memory for ever. The band playing on, the captain awaiting his fate, the mother ushering her children to sleep before the sea comes to take them, the old boy drinking his brandy as the water rushes in, or just Jack and Rose, polar opposites in society's class structure, making love, making art or just professing that neither will ever let go. It's what makes Titanic the wonderful piece of cinema it is, where beauty and tragedy merge to create something forever memorable. A film that deserved all the accolades and cash till ringing that it once did have. 9/10",

  "content": "Set around the ill-fated maiden voyage of the RMS \"Titanic\", this is essentially a film in two parts. The first, weaker, element features a young \"Dawson\" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who wins a third class ticket to New York on the soon to depart liner. Meantime, the wealthy but unhappy \"Rose\" (Kate Winslet) is up in the posh cabins with her cold and unfeeling fiancée \"Hockley\" (Billy Zane) and her equally unpleasant, venally ambitious mother \"Ruth\" (Frances Fisher). Desperately unhappy, \"Rose\" considers jumping off the prow of the boat, but luckily the charming young \"Dawson\" is on hand to talk her down, and so begins their friendship that causes much chagrin amongst her socially elite companions. That friendship culminates in him making a rather provocative drawing of her, the final straw for her boyfriend and his enforcer \"Lovejoy\" (David Warner). It all looks ominous for both until - part two begins. The ship, speeding along nicely under the command of Bernard Hill's Captain Smith clips the underwater part of an iceberg and now history takes over. James Cameron offers us a purely speculative account of what might have happened as the initially incredulous crew start to realise that maybe it is not just Molly Brown (an excellent Kathy Bates) that's unsinkable! What now ensues are a series of well staged scenarios depicting panic, fear, a fair degree of selfishness and some proper stiff upper lips as the ship has be evacuated and the segregation of the passengers and competencies of the crew start to become life threatening. The visual effects have dated, the smoke from the ship's funnels blows in an strangely symmetrical fashion and the later scenes struggle to convince - but this is really a rather tragic love story with a strong chemistry between the engaging two characters at the top of the bill, and an effective performance from the older \"Rose\" (Gloria Stewart) who takes on the role of narrator 80 years after the disaster. I still find it uncomfortable to watch the actuality of the wreck, which features occasionally throughout the film - I feel like I am quite literally walking through someone's grave; but it does lend a potent hook upon which this lengthy, but well thought out and constructed drama is presented. Criticisms have been made of it's factual inaccuracies, and it may well play a bit fast and loose with some of the real characterisations - but it's a drama, and to be enjoyed has to be appreciated in that sphere. Big screen is a must, it really does lose a great deal on a television.",

  "content": "Titanic is simply a masterpiece. This movie has it all. A tremendous score, deep emotion emphasized by fantastic performances, and incredibly gripping and high-stakes action. There is really something for everyone here.\r\n\r\nBefore I continue my praise of the film, I think it has one glaring weakness: the present-day plot. For me, this just did not work all that well. I understand that it was implemented for the main story to have a more emotional impact, but it was not needed. It added almost thirty minutes to the runtime, which could have been used for more character development in the story or to have a more streamlined plot. Not to mention, the acting in this section was lackluster. That might be a hot take, but it was something that I noticed during my watch.\r\n\r\nBack to the positives. The score is magnificent here. The minute I finished the film, I had an urge to put on this score to be transported back to the Titanic. That does not happen very often to me.\r\n\r\nThe performances are great all around. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet's chemistry was perfect. They played off each other so well and really sold this emphatic and rapid love the two shared. The movie spends a lot of time building their relationship and the payoff at the end is worth every second. Billy Zane was an over-the-top asshole, and even though it was cheesy at times, it worked for me. The other ancillary cast members did well, including Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher and Bill Paxton.\r\n\r\nThis film is really two movies put into one and both of them work excellently. The first half is a charming and cute love story that spends a lot of time on character development, laying the background for motivations and personalities. While this half may have been my favorite, it is slightly outdone by the second half, which is a gripping and suspenseful survival action story. This section is brutal, showing large scale panic and hysteria while also having some incredibly horrific deaths. The chaos was infectious and very scary to watch. Both halves create a great sense of emotion in the audience and complement each other very well.\r\n\r\nOverall, this movie had twenty-five years of hype and critical acclaim to live up to, and I am happy to say it passed expectations. Since leaving the theater, I cannot stop thinking about it.\r\n\r\nScore: 96% |\r\nVerdict: Masterpiece\r\n\r\nOn a side note: I did see this movie in 3D during the twenty-five-anniversary re-release. While it was great to see it remastered in 4K, I do think the 3D was poor and unneeded. This did not affect my grade however, since it was not originally designed as a 3D experience, and they 3D did not really take away for my enjoyment.",

  "content": "Titanic (1997), directed by James Cameron, is one of those films that never loses its impact, no matter how many times you watch it. Some might call it overrated, but it’s hard to deny the emotional weight and the sheer craftsmanship that went into making it. Rewatching it reminded me why it’s stood the test of time, it’s a great mix of story, performances, and technical execution.\r\n\r\nLeonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet deliver standout performances as Jack and Rose. Their chemistry is natural and believable, and it’s what drives the story forward. The drawing scene is iconic for many reasons, both on and off the screen. Interestingly, it wasn’t DiCaprio sketching Rose, it was actually James Cameron himself. Cameron, who’s also an artist, added a personal touch to the scene by creating the famous drawing. Behind the scenes, Winslet knew the scene could be awkward since it involved nudity and was one of their first together, so she flashed DiCaprio to help him relax. Even with that, he was nervous and flubbed his line, saying, “Lie on that bed… uh, couch” instead of just “couch.” The mistake stayed in the film, and it adds a little authenticity to the moment.\r\n\r\nVisually, Titanic is impressive on every level. The production design is meticulous. From the luxurious first-class interiors to the gritty third-class quarters, every set looks authentic and lived-in. The cinematography captures both the intimacy of Jack and Rose’s relationship and the overwhelming scale of the disaster. The sinking sequence is still one of the most intense and well-executed moments in film. Cameron used a mix of practical effects, real sets, and CGI to recreate the chaos, and it all blends seamlessly. The result is a scene that’s visually stunning and emotionally gripping.\r\n\r\nThe final act ties everything together perfectly. Rose’s memories, paired with James Horner’s haunting score, deliver an emotional gut punch. That last shot is unforgettable and leaves you thinking long after the credits roll.\r\n\r\nTitanic isn’t just about a historical tragedy or a love story, it’s a film about human connection and the choices we make when everything’s on the line. Cameron’s attention to detail, paired with strong performances and excellent storytelling, makes this one of the most impactful films ever made. Overrated? Maybe. But it’s a benchmark in filmmaking for a reason.",

Unfortunately for him; his best intentions are about to make things much worse in “Spider-Man: No Way Home”.\r\n\r\nTaking place where “Spider-Man: Far From Home” ended; Peter must deal with his secret identity being leaked by Tabloid Journalist J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons); and the throngs of people, helicopters, and protestors who follow his every move and camp outside his home.\r\n\r\nAs if this was not bad enough; being accused of being a murderer has drawn the attention of the authorities which further complicates his life as does returning to a school where everyone knows his identity.\r\n\r\nDesperate to get away from the constant scrutiny and observation; Peter seeks out Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and asks him to cast a spell that would make the world forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.\r\n\r\nStrange agrees but mid-spell Peter requests that there are some exemptions from the spell which include his Girlfriend MJ (Zendaya); his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei); and his friend Ned (Jacob Batalon).\r\n\r\nStrange agrees but in doing so; complications arise which allows entrants from other dimensions to enter their realm. Soon Peter is accosted by villains whom he does not know but seem to know him; that is until he is unmasked and they have no idea who this Peter Parker is before them.\r\n\r\nAs more villains arrive; Peter learns of their fates in their natural dimension and is determined to save them and give them a second chance which puts him at odds with Doctor Strange who says they must go back to whatever fate they had.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a descent into humor and darkness as Peter despite his best intentions sees the situation go from bad to worse and he must fight to stay true to himself and save the day.\r\n\r\nThe film is a difficult one to review in the fact that there are so many surprise guests, twists, and turns that it is challenging to not reveal anything but suffice it to say that fans should absolutely enjoy it.\r\n\r\nThe film takes its time getting to the action as it has a very slow and deliberate climb and Director Jon Watts is confident enough in the characters and premise that he allows ample time for the characters and setting to build and be established before he gets to the action.\r\n\r\nWhile there is considerable fan service in the film; it never once seems like it is pandering and it all fits very well within the story and the MCU and opens up numerous possibilities for the future.\r\n\r\nThere is a mid-credit scene and a post-credit scene which is basically a trailer and both are very engaging in terms of the possibilities as Marvel has again shown that their plan of interwoven stories and characters continues to deliver and that Spider-Man still remains as popular and engaging as ever.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5",

Unbelievably outstanding performances from everyone involved, especially Tom Holland, Zendaya, and Willem Dafoe.\r\n\r\nA heartfelt, nostalgic homage to the Spider-Man legacy that fans will rewatch countless times, laughing and crying along for many more years to come.\r\n\r\nA memorable, passionate, once-in-a-lifetime cinematic experience.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A",

The plot is dense not in fault but in advantage, it crams in expectation with suitable comedy and light heartedness. The director created a a comprehensive journey of emotion with several troughs and many peaks leaving a sense of WOAH at the end.\r\n\r\nOverall, **'Spider-man NWH'** is a Marvel Maniac's Heaven but can ruin marvel experiences for the uniformed viewers spoiling previous films and enjoyment of them. This is not a stand-alone film and for some this amazing but for many of those seeking to enter the universe this is not at all suitable. This and the poorly grand soundtrack make it 4.5 stars.",

I was not expecting to love this film as much as I do! It surpassed my expectations in every way possible, to the point that I'd say it beats <em>'Avengers: Endgame'</em> as my favourite production from the MCU. This is a next level superhero movie, it's easily the most I've consistently enjoyed a film in this series and genre - no question.\r\n\r\nThe cast are all outstanding, it's ace how they work everyone in from previous iterations of <em>'Spider-Man'</em> - even away from the main universe. Seeing Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire together onscreen as Peter Parker is tremendous. The film does it in the perfect way, at no point does it feel forced or needless and the humour between the trio is excellent; in fact, the whole film is funny when it intends to be.\r\n\r\nZendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon (his best showing of the trilogy), Jon Favreau and Marisa Tomei also add positives things to this 2021 film. Jamie Foxx, Alfred Molina and, most pleasing for me, Willem Dafoe all reprise their characters from past releases and are all a joy. I'm a fan of Dafoe so was particularly happy to see him reappear.\r\n\r\nOnto what we see onscreen. The plot is great and I wouldn't change anything about it, there is one or two things that I had question marks about whilst watching but those quickly dissipated. The pacing is top notch and the music is superb, the respective screen times of everybody was pinpoint and, along with the already noted humour, the film also packs a punch on a more serious level to boot.\r\n\r\nThis really is top tier Marvel! Would watch again, would recommended etc. Awesome!",

  "content": "This is another Spider Man for kids which for me is a wee bit unfortunate. I would very much have liked a Peter Parker / Spider Man that behaved like a real superhero instead of this naïve kid who constantly thinks he knows better than the grown ups and, of course, constantly bungles things up.\r\n\r\nIn addition I was not too thrilled about the story itself where Spider Man right at the beginning is framed as the bad guy. I know, I know, it is rather consistent with the original comics but Hollywood do not hesitate so change things if they feel like it so why not make a good change for once?\r\n\r\nThe good thing about this movie is the special effects. They are quite cool. Especially the parts in this weird space where Doctor Strange and Spider Man dukes it out. Unfortunately that is pretty much it.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the movie is really dragged down by the childish and stupid behavior of Peter Parker. Him being a real idiot and constantly trying to change the spell was just cringe worthy. Then he continues screwing things up because he do not want notorious criminals to go back to their real place because they will actually die there. Typical Hollywood sob story. Despite what that dumb bitch said towards the end, yes Peter Parker you did something wrong, you screwed up big time and the wrong people died because of it.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that was really annoying throughout the movie was listening to that moron Jonah Jameson from The Daily Bugle. He was spewing almost as much fake news as CNN and it just pissed me off every time he was on screen.\r\n\r\nIt is a shame really. One would have thought that, given that they already did the young and immature Spider Man in Spider Man: Far From Home, they could have made him more experienced and mature in this one. You know, character advancement.\r\n\r\nInstead they just piled on the childish, naïve and immature behavior with a good dose of juvenile jokes making what, with some actual intelligent script writing, could have been a great movie with all those cool special effects (and I really do like Doctor Strange) to be one just barely watchable.",

Along the way, they encounter the hippie \"Martin\" (Rhys Ifans) and his family and cadge a lift in their VW camper-van whilst offering a fairly tuneless rendition of some David Bowie. It all builds up to a fairly predictable denouement with humanity facing some tough choices, the seemingly indestructible aliens on the verge of success and our intrepid partnership having to consider the ultimate sacrifice. Yep, we've seen it all before and though the visual effects are pretty impressive, that's not really enough to sustain it as it rather procedurally rolls along. There is occasionally some wit in the script and Hardy looks like he's having fun, but Chiwetel Ejiofor is largely under-used and it relies far too heavily on repetitive combat scenes to really make it stand out amidst the surfeit of 2024 comic-book derivatives. It's all watchable enough, but it's not a patch on the first one from 2018.",

Secondly, there's the interplay between Hardy and Venom which can be genuinely funny. \r\n\r\nThis latest and possibly last film in the series, \"Venom: The Last Dance\", is, I believe, the weakest in the line up. Unlike its predecessors, it feels a little bit rushed and somehow, anti climatic. That said, it still has its moments of engaging humour and not half decent action.\r\n\r\nIn summary, its a shame to see \"Venom\" shelved (if in fact that's the case) as its one of the better Marvel universe franchises, with great chemistry between Hardy and his other worldly alter ego, Venom.

With \"Po\" being told by \"Master Shifu\" that it is now time for him to move onwards and upwards - much to his chagrin - he must recruit a new dragon warrior so he can retreat to more cerebral pastimes. Luckily, though, the \"Chameleon\" has designs on obtaining all the powers from those now consigned to the nether realm and using the powers of Kung Fu to take over the world. \"Po\" has to be put his promotion on hold and along with his new-found, and useful, foxy friend \"Zhen\" try to thwart these heinous ambitions. Though there's plenty of action and self-deprecating dialogue the storyline really is too much of a recycled affair. Even the panda has been drawn into the multi-verse and to be frank, I'm a bit bored with that theme now - especially as it's never really accompanied by much in the way of jeopardy. Yes, this is an entirely predicable story that, in this case, misses out on the characterisations of his pals from the \"Furious Five\". It's watchable and the story well paced; there's some fun to be had in the wobbly, mountain-top, tavern but I think I've already forgotten most of it.",

The story, action, dialogues, character building, the tension between Tai Lung and Shifu, everything was fabulous. Well, I can go on and on about the first Kung Fu Panda, but this is about this unbearable trash Kung Fu Panda 4.\r\n\r\nThis movie is so bad that calling it boring would be a compliment. Out of nowhere, this Zhen character manifests. All the formula film scenes replicated, unnecessary fights, moving around without any purpose, cracking jokes (painfully unfunny) out of nowhere, and so on. I wanted to leave the movie after 20 minutes but then I thought maybe something good would happen. However, I was wrong till the end. \r\n\r\nPathetic direction, dialogue delivery and unfunny jokes started feeling irritating. No chemistry between Po and Zhen, and somehow they both are ready to die for each other. The Zhen character was uninteresting and annoying.\r\n\r\nJust like contemporary movies where people get everything without any sacrifice or struggle, they managed to \"Mary Sue\" Zhen by making her the next dragon warrior.\r\n\r\nI am glad that this movie ended this way. At least now I know I won’t be watching any more trash from this franchise.\r\n\r\nIf you loved the first Kung Fu panda, please stay away from this. Please save and cherish your good memories. You have been warned.\r\n\r\n*I wanted to give it 1.5, but the sliding scale couldn’t select it, so I gave it 2/10.",

The voices we hear are perfectly satisfactory, from Jack Black to Awkwafina, Viola Davis (the best, away from lead) and the rest.\r\n\r\nThe music here is good.

I listened to it an embarrassing amount when it first released alongside this movie, the video was admittedly part of the reason why - I'm always a fan of seeing film casts in music videos.\r\n\r\nThere's a decent story told, alongside nice animation.

Well, yes, but if that's the only card a film has then you might as well get your shirt off and play it! Sadly, that is all that can really be said for this plodding superhero adventure. The \"Kravinoff\" siblings \"Dimi\" (Billy Barratt) and \"Sergei\" (Levi Miller) are taken out of their posh school by their oligarch father (Russell Crowe) and taken on a hunt in Ghana to develop their masculinity. They are on the trail of a lion called \"Czar\" and it's an encounter with him and then with a local girl called \"Calypso\" (Diaana Babnicova) that sees the latter brother emerge injured but changed. Quite profoundly changed too! Skip on many years and the \"Sergei\" (now Aaron Taylor-Johnson) has no relationship with his father, though is still in contact with his brother (now Fred Hechinger), and he has developed some remarkably animalistic ninja skills. He's the ultimate in natural forces for good. Meantime, though, things are hotting up amongst the criminal fraternity and a chance re-encounter with a grown up \"Calypso\" (Ariana DeBose) sets up a denouement with a nasty baddie who has to survive on refrigerated gel packs from his rucksack else he gets especially thick-skinned. Along the way there are several, quite violent, escapades that allow the star to show off his physical prowess, Crowe to show off his thick Siberian accent and Hechinger to look about as weedy as possible. Thereafter there isn't an original bone in it's CGI-fest of a body. The script is actually pretty diabolical and the plot really struggles to get off the ground as this lumbers, quite literally, along for over two hours. It's as if it were a few episodes of a mini-series hastily condensed into a film; it's bitty, disjointed and the denouement is all rather underwhelming. Clearly there is scope for a sequel, but I doubt anyone will have an appetite for it.",

With such beautiful principal actors it would be very easy to gin up a 90's or 00's type of rom-com, but this was exceedingly more thoughtful and interesting. \r\n\r\nIf I have any complaint at all, it's the ending, which (IMHO) did not fit with the overall theme of the story and a little forced. \r\n\r\nBut still, very good. 9/10 stars.",

  "content": "Celine Song's Materialists is a stunningly mature, emotionally intelligent romantic drama, one that redefines the very concept of modern love without falling into the usual pitfalls of the genre. Anchored by three outstanding performances, Dakota Johnson, Chris Evans, and Pedro Pascal share extraordinary chemistry that feels raw, layered, and heartbreakingly authentic. Song's screenplay dissects with surgical precision the transactional nature of today's dating world, where intangible values like affection and vulnerability often struggle against the ever-growing checklist of material, social, and political boxes. Money, body image, height, political leanings - even something as seemingly trivial as the texture of one's hair - are thoughtfully explored as factors that, in theory, should dictate compatibility. But through intimate silences, aching glances, and conversations that pierce right through the soul, Song reminds us that love, in all its flawed, inexplicable glory, cannot be quantified.\r\n\r\nTechnically, Materialists is a masterclass in restraint. There's barely a musical score to be found, allowing every silence, every breath, and every hesitant word to carry the full weight of the characters' feelings. The cinematography makes the bold, unconventional choice to focus on the listener rather than the speaker, granting the audience rare insight into the unsaid, the reactions that words alone can't convey. Lingering shots in moments of silence exude not only tension but a rare, electric chemistry between the characters. The film crafts its emotional crescendo without a single moment of forced dramatization, making the eventual choices of Johnson's character feel entirely organic. Song bravely avoids providing easy answers: there's no judgment, no clear winner in the love triangle. Whether one follows love with all its imperfections, as in the Dakota-Evans connection, or chooses the materially perfect partner lacking in emotional spark, as represented by Pascal's character, Materialists argues that either path is valid - and equally human.\r\n\r\nIf there's one area where Song perhaps leans too heavily, it's in the recurring client interviews of Johnson's character, which, while often sharp and humorous, begin to border on repetitive. The thematic point about society's shallow dating expectations lands early on, and a couple of these scenes feel like they're spelling out what the rest of the movie has already conveyed so gracefully. But this minor excess does little to detract from the overall impact. Materialists stands as one of the finest romantic dramas in recent memory, brilliantly avoiding the traps of cliché and formula. It's a profoundly insightful exploration of why we fall in love, and how that choice - no matter how irrational, imperfect, or impractical - might be the truest thing about us.\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

  "content": "Given that so much of modern-day dating goes on online between people who have never met, nor ever intend to meet, the person they are courting, I had hoped this would deliver a more brutal critique of an industry that is predicated on shallowness, fickleness and downright lying, but it just didn’t do it for me. “Lucy” (Dakota Johnson) is the $80,000-a-year matchmaker whose job it is is to dress in over-sixes suits and to tick and reconcile as many boxes from each of her clients as she can then hope that when they do actually sit down in front of each other, they don’t take their fork to their own, or their date’s, eyes! She’s quite successful, indeed it is at the weeding for her ninth couple, that she tries to drum up business from those singles and divorcées impressed by her skills. She’s overheard by the brother of the groom (Pedro Pascal) who elicits from her that all she actually wants for herself is a man who has more money than God. He qualifies, but reckons she isn’t so venal and so embarks on a courtship ritual that wouldn’t have looked out of place in a Jane Austin meets Julia Child story. Meantime, “Sophie” (Zoe Withers) is one of her clients who has a shocking experience and that proves unsettling for the hitherto uber-confident “Lucy” who might actually start to look at herself in the mirror and perhaps, just perhaps, not like what she sees. As if that wedding wasn’t momentous enough for the gal, she also runs onto her ex (Chris Evans) who’s a budding actor, a cater-waiter, and clearly still burns a candle for her. He hasn’t two pennies to rub together though, so what chance he can ever engage with her again? Whom will she choose? Whom (if anyone) will want to choose her? Why should we care? I’m afraid that I just didn’t. There are occasional moments of humour here, but for the most part it’s a rather toothless attempt to analyse the vacuousness of a business that could have been satirically analysed far more effectively if we hadn’t just been subsumed into an uninteresting melodrama with loads of foie gras, fine wine and a fairly torturous effort to add six inches… Pascal is classy and does enough and Evans can always get away with the boy-next-door look, but it all just reminded me of a soap. There’s far too much dialogue and nowhere near enough substance, and what looked promising at the start just fizzled into blandness fairly swiftly. Why is it that when people are fabulously wealthy, they buy such uncomfortable looking couches and never seem to have a television?",

  "content": "There are times in our lives when nearly all of us exceed the limits of our capabilities (and often quite unexpectedly at that). But that can be a tremendous blessing, especially when we’re confronted by circumstances where such aptitudes are called for. So it is for Roz (Lupita Nyong’o), a robot who inadvertently ends up stranded on a remote island when the vessel transporting her crashes without warning. Roz isn’t alone, though; she finds herself surrounded by a diverse array of forest animals who, curious though they might be, don’t quite know what to make of the mysterious metallic stranger. Meanwhile, the somewhat bewildered new arrival is out of her anticipated element, too, expecting to be in the company of humans for whom she’s been programmed to function as a domestic servant. However, the fundamental disconnect between these parties gradually dissipates as they each get to know one another, particularly when Roz needs to grow beyond her innate programming to overcome a series of challenges and bond with her new organic familiars, most notably a young goose (Kit Connor) whom she’s charged with raising when the gosling’s parents are accidently killed. Before long, Roz develops a sentience that helps her evolve beyond a collection of circuits and microchips, a development that proves valuable in a world beset by even bigger issues. In his latest animated feature outing, writer-director Chris Sanders has created a thoughtful, entertaining tale with an uplifting message we can all draw upon when life ups the ante on us. The picture’s stunningly gorgeous animation, solid writing, and delightfully amusing voiceover performances by the likes of Nyong’o and co-stars Pedro Pascal, Bill Nighy, Mark Hamill, Catherine O’Hara, Ving Rhames and Stephanie Hsu collectively deliver a fine mix of hearty laughs, inspiring insights and touching moments, all without becoming silly or saccharine. Admittedly, the film has a little trouble finding its footing at the outset, and a few story threads feel a little underdeveloped, such as subplots related to important but underexplained environmental themes. What’s more, it can be somewhat mystifying at times trying to figure out exactly who this offering was made for, as the material often comes across as a little more mature and decidedly more intense than what one might expect for younger viewers (despite its adorable depictions of its funny, furry forest creatures). However, these modest shortcomings are more than made up for the further one gets into the story, growing progressively stronger as the narrative unfolds. Most importantly, though, it’s gratifying to see a production that genuinely rises above the low bar that has been set for many releases in this genre these days. “The Wild Robot” is one of those films that’s sure to please a wide range of moviegoers, including those who generally aren’t particularly enamored with animation. It’s a feel-good movie that doesn’t resort to wearing that trait on its sleeve – but that nevertheless achieves such an admirably heartwarming effect anyways.",

  "content": "\"Roz\" is pre-programmed to help. Whatever it is that needs doing, it is there to make it happen - even when it is wrecked on an island populated by animals whose main desire in life is to eat each other. At least the arrival of the \"monster\" manages to galvanise them into one brief moment of hostile unanimity and so when they are not trying to cannibalise it, they are shunning it's efforts to be friends. After spending a year learning their various languages, there follows a calamitous escapade with a nest, a chase with an hungry fox (\"Fink\") and the creation of the most unlikely of family units charged with rearing a particularly timid little gosling whom they name \"Brightbill\". The scene is now set for some entertaining adventures as \"Roz\" has to teach her new-found charge how to eat, to swim and then ultimately to fly away so as to avoid the harsh winter. Each of those tasks comes with it's own hazards but maybe, just maybe, our little team can manage to get project \"Brightbill\" off the ground? No, of course there's no jeopardy here at all, and at times it's comes across as an amalgam of \"Wall:E\" (2008) with some Hans Christian Anderson thrown in for good measure. That's no bad thing, though, as the characterisation of the android is personable and develops amiably as his programming starts to evolve into something far more akin to a soul than a brain. It does tackle some more serious subjects - loneliness, rejection, isolation and issues with self-esteem to name a few, but always in fashion that illustrates a point then offers some sort of optimism that a solution can be found for even the most difficult challenges. The standard of animation is engagingly natural and it's genuinely quite funny with some of the observations, especially from the fox, working well within the framework of a touching story that extols the values of caring, teamwork and even a little forgiveness, without becoming gloopy or dialogue-heavy. It looks great on a big screen and is well worth a gander...!",

It's impossible not to empathize with the story and characters as they unfold so brilliantly on screen.

I feel like he's a bit tame, I never once felt fear/angst from the guy at all. A much more devilish, deceptive bad guy would've been far better. I didn't even realise it's Jason Lee who voices him either, it oddly doesn't sound like Lee to me.\r\n\r\nTalking of mishearing the voice cast, am I the only one who thought it was Jodie Foster voicing Elastigirl? Violet kinda sounds like Aubrey Plaza too. I think I may need my ears tested... Elsewhere, it's cool to hear (correctly, this time) Samuel L. Jackson as Frozone.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, this is certainly a film worth watching 100%. I just would've loved a greater threat to the protagonists.

Still, it was there enough, the work-life balance to draw you in, and the absurdity that the work was being a hero was entertaining.\r\n\r\nAs was the reason they had to go underground which, again, was done a little better than when the MCU tried it...but still not elaborated on enough to make it as interesting as it could have once been.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it's still an entertaining cartoon.

  "content": "Every now and again when you watch antiques programmes on television and somebody turns up with a toy in it's original box - that turns out to be worth more than his car - I regret that I no longer possess any from my childhood. I do recall, however, being especially fickle - the favourite one day was never likely to reign long before being supplanted by another. That's the case here for cowboy \"Woody\". He is the favourite of owner \"Andy\" amongst, it has to be said, rather a lot of different ones. Until, that is - one birthday, we meet Space Ranger \"Buzz Lightyear\". He's actually quite an affable chap, but the green eyed monster is now in charge and \"Woody\" tries to relegate his successor down the side of the bed. That goes wrong and, accidentally, out of the window he goes. The other toys are horrified, leaving \"Woody\" with no option but to get over his laser envy, rescue his new rival and repatriate him before the whole family move to a new home! What now ensues are some fun escapades, near misses and they fall into the hands of another young boy who really does want to blast \"Buzz\" into space. The vocal talents of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are enthusiastic and entertaining, those of Don Rickles (\"Mr. Potato Head\") sometimes a little nearer the bone for the grown ups and they are all helped along by a good soundtrack and a wittily written script offering us plenty of scenarios that draw the viewer (of whatever age) into this simple, pretty timeless story. It's interesting, for 1995, to note the wide variety of toys this young boy has, too - no gender stereotyping, which is quite refreshing. This is quickly paced and enjoyable animation that touches on the values of trust, companionship and team spirt - as well as the demerits of envy and selfishness - and I really enjoyed it.",

  "content": "Toy Story (1995)– A Groundbreaking Animated Classic That Still Shines\r\n\r\nWhen Toy Story was released in 1995, it wasn’t just another animated film—it was a revolution. As the first feature-length movie created entirely with CGI, Pixar’s debut film set a new standard for storytelling, animation, and emotional depth in family films. Nearly three decades later, Toy Story remains as charming, funny, and heartfelt as ever.\r\n\r\nA Story That Captivates All Ages\r\n\r\nAt its core, Toy Story is a tale of friendship, jealousy, and personal growth. The film follows Woody (Tom Hanks), a cowboy doll and the leader of Andy’s toys, whose world is turned upside down when the flashy, space-themed Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) arrives. Woody’s initial resentment towards Buzz—who doesn’t even realize he’s a toy—sparks an entertaining rivalry that soon turns into an unforgettable adventure. The journey teaches both characters valuable lessons about teamwork, self-worth, and loyalty, making the film resonate deeply with audiences of all ages.\r\n\r\nUnforgettable Characters & Voice Performances\r\n\r\nOne of Toy Story’s greatest strengths is its memorable characters, each with distinct personalities that feel real. Tom Hanks brings warmth and humor to Woody, portraying his insecurities and leadership with depth. Tim Allen’s Buzz Lightyear is both hilarious and endearing, with his delusional hero complex creating some of the film’s funniest moments. The supporting cast—Don Rickles as the grumpy Mr. Potato Head, Wallace Shawn as the nervous Rex, and Annie Potts as the kind-hearted Bo Peep—adds layers of charm and humor.\r\n\r\nRevolutionary Animation That Still Holds Up\r\n\r\nFor a film made in the mid-’90s, Toy Story’s animation remains impressive. While Pixar’s later works have refined their techniques, the film’s colorful visuals, expressive character animations, and attention to detail still make it a joy to watch. The animators brilliantly bring the toys to life, giving each one unique movements that reflect their materials—Woody’s floppy limbs, Buzz’s rigid plastic movements, and Slinky Dog’s springy physics.\r\n\r\nA Timeless Message With Heart\r\n\r\nBeyond its technical achievements, Toy Story endures because of its emotional depth. Themes of friendship, acceptance, and finding one’s place in the world are beautifully woven into the narrative. Woody and Buzz’s journey from rivals to best friends is one of the most iconic character arcs in animated history. The film also cleverly explores a child’s imagination, capturing the magic of toys coming to life when no one’s watching.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\n\r\nToy Story isn’t just a great animated film—it’s one of the greatest films ever made. It revolutionized the animation industry, introduced beloved characters, and delivered a heartfelt story that remains as impactful today as it was in 1995. Whether you’re watching it for the first time or revisiting it as an adult, Toy Story is a masterpiece that continues to entertain, inspire, and remind us why we fell in love with movies in the first place.\r\n\r\n⭐ Rating: 10/10",

With a powerhouse performance from Sophie Thatcher anchoring it all, this psychological thriller - sprinkled with comedy, romance, and even sci-fi elements - stands out as one of the year's first big surprises.\r\n\r\nI highly recommend watching it in theaters, as blind as possible.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B",

  "content": "<em>'Companion'</em> is great! I was actually spoiled on the general gist of this due to the trailers, which I didn't even seek out but despite ignoring them pre-other flicks I still managed to catch what this was about. Happily, it didn't matter as the film lets the cat out fairly quickly.\r\n\r\nI thought the aforementioned was going to be an issue, even though it is only a 90 minute movie I didn't think at that moment that it was going to have enough in the tank to make the overall movie enjoyable. I was wrong! It's a blast all the way through, there's a pleasant pace to it all.\r\n\r\nSophie Thatcher is brilliant, her showing is impressive and very convincing. That blood-soaked look is class. The rest of the cast aren't on Thatcher's level but are still positive parts of this film, namely Jack Quaid and Lukas Gage. Thanks to the short run time, this does fly by. Top film!\r\n\r\nI saw it on the big screen as part of a double bill of sorts with <em>'Hard Truths'</em>. This was the second one and it's a barrel of laughs compared to that Mike Leigh picture. Two films that I would highly recommend, all the same.",

  "content": "We first meet \"Iris\" (Sophie Thatcher) and boyfriend \"Josh\" (Jack Quaid) as they take his self-drive car into the wilderness to meet with some of his friends at the home of millionaire \"Sergey\" (a delightfully over-the-top Rupert Friend). She's not at all keen on his pals. She thinks they look down on her. He tries to reassure her and when they arrive we are introduced to \"Kat\" (Megan Suri) and to loved-up \"Eli\" (Harvey Guillén) and \"Patrick\" (Lukas Gage). She was right, they don't much like her and at this point (for me, anyway) the penny started to drop. The married \"Sergey\" is supposed to be dating \"Kat\" but he's obviously a bit of a Lothario who tries it on with \"Iris\" and, well let's just say he probably wished he hadn't. Thing is, though, there's an whole load of manipulation going on here and it doesn't take \"Iris\", or us, long to realise that nothing is really as it seems. There's a fun chemistry on display here between Thatcher and Quaid and auteur Drew Hancock has crafted an entertaining scenario that avoids the standard cabin-in-the-woods style horror feature. This is a darkly comedic \"careful what you've wished for\" style of drama that has some decent menace intermingled with a few shades of Dan Stevens in \"Cuckoo\" from last year, too. For me, though, it's the dentally perfect Gage who steals the show proving the very point that true love isn't just skin deep and not everyone keeps their brains in their head! Amidst a tired and formulaic genre, this offers a refreshing change well worth a watch.",

  "content": "Companion (2025) is another entry in the ever-growing “AI gone wrong” genre, but it does try to shake things up a little. The story is decent, keeping things interesting without dragging too much, though it still hits a lot of familiar beats. The twist on how the AI becomes a problem is a nice touch, but in the end, it doesn’t change the usual outcome. The climax is predictable, but it fits the film, so it doesn’t feel out of place.\r\n\r\nVisually, the movie looks great. The locations are stunning, and the cinematography really helps set the mood. The directing keeps things moving at a good pace without overcomplicating anything. Sophie Thatcher is easily the standout here, she gives a great performance and makes her character feel real. The rest of the cast is fine, but she’s the one who really carries the film.\r\n\r\nThe script is simple but works for what the movie is trying to do. Some of the dialogue could have been sharper, but nothing feels awkward or forced. The music choice is solid, adding to the atmosphere without being too much. Overall, Companion is a fun watch if you like AI thrillers, but it doesn’t bring anything wildly new to the table. If you liked M3GAN, you’ll probably enjoy this too.",

  "content": "At first glance, “Companion” might seem like just another weekend-getaway-gone-wrong horror flick, but don’t be fooled. Writer / director Drew Hancock has crafted an incredibly fun and intense story that blends slasher thrills, sci-fi existentialism, and a sharp feminist edge into a blood-soaked ride that’s as entertaining as it is thought-provoking. This is so much more than an average popcorn movie, and it’s one of my favorites so far this year.\r\n\r\nThe film follows Iris (Sophie Thatcher), a seemingly ordinary woman who joins her boyfriend Josh (Jack Quaid) and his friends (Megan Suri, Lukas Gage, and Harvey Guillén) on a retreat to a remote cabin. The weekend takes a dark turn when secrets unravel, especially when it’s revealed that Iris is not what she seems. Without diving into spoilers, the film takes its time peeling back the layers of its characters, leading to a series of shocking revelations and a gloriously chaotic finale that fully embraces its campy, over-the-top nature.\r\n\r\nThe cast delivers tenfold, with terrific lead performances from Thatcher and Quaid. She carries the film with a mix of vulnerability, strength, and eerie unpredictability, while he seems like a natural with his turn as a less-than-perfect partner. The supporting characters are well-written too, from a smarmy Russian host (Rupert Friend) to Josh’s loyal friends who get caught up in the chaos.\r\n\r\nWhile the story can feel familiar at times, it still manages to be wildly unpredictable. Hancock makes excellent use of the secluded setting to build suspense before unleashing the bloodbath, and he finds a good balance between comedy and horror.\r\n\r\nBeneath the fun and carnage are some serious ideas about artificial intelligence, misogyny, toxic love, and the nature of autonomy. The film critiques the way women are conditioned to cater to harmful partners, explores the illusion of “perfect” relationships, and questions what it truly means to be human. The script handles these themes with thoughtful wit, balancing tension, dark humor, and a sense of empowerment that becomes more apparent as the story unfolds. You could easily and mindlessly enjoy this film at face value, but moviegoers wanting a bit more will not be disappointed.\r\n\r\nServing up a thrilling mix of horror, sci-fi, and feminist commentary, “Companion” is an absolute blast. Bloody, bold, and packed with fun twists, this story of power and identity is wrapped in a fun, violent, and gloriously campy package.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

  "content": "Companion feels like an extended, uncomfortably intimate episode of Black Mirror. It shares the same eerie mix of dystopian technology, cool design, and digital paranoia. Everything appears clean on the surface, but something is deeply wrong underneath. Unlike Black Mirror, which often steps back to marvel at the dark potential of technology, Companion dives into something more grounded, more personal, and more brutal.\r\n\r\nThe horror here does not come from a rogue AI or a system glitching out. It comes from a man using high-tech tools not to solve a problem but to get exactly what he wants. What he wants is control, submission, and silence.\r\n\r\nThe sci-fi details, such as the rented android, the customization app, and the perfectly manicured suburb, are really just a thin disguise. Beneath it all lies a far more disturbing and all-too-recognizable truth: even if you build a woman from scratch, even if she is made of code and programmed to please you, that will not stop the harm. The abuse still finds its way in.\r\n\r\nAt first glance, Companion might seem like another entry in the growing list of AI-centered sci-fi films where artificial intelligence crashes into human emotion and chaos follows. But look closer, and you will see that it is not really about technology at all. It is about power, about control, about the kind of abuse that hides in plain sight, dressed up as love or connection.\r\n\r\nThis is not a story about machines breaking down. It is about a man who thinks love means ownership. It is about the emotional, social, and technological systems that allow that belief to thrive. The violence in Companion is not an accident. It is the logical conclusion of the world Josh creates a world where he is never challenged, never vulnerable, and never forced to see the woman in front of him as a person.\r\n\r\nWhat makes Companion so haunting and so effective is how it uses AI not to speculate about the future but to hold up a mirror to the present. Misogyny does not vanish as technology evolves. It simply finds new ways to survive. When that buried female rage finally surfaces, it is not a glitch or revenge. It is survival, long overdue and deeply human.\r\n\r\nThis is not really a film about the future. It is a reflection of the present. What it shows us is uncomfortable, familiar, and impossible to ignore.",

  "content": "The film adaptation of Wicked is based on the Broadway musical, which is a loose adaptation of the 1995 novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West by Gregory Maguire. Both Maguire’s novel and the musical are expansions of L. Frank Baum’s original The Wizard of Oz novel was published in 1900 and its film adaptation in 1939. The musical is one of the longest-running and financially successful Broadway musicals of all time.\r\n\r\nWith a screenplay by Winnie Holzman (writer of the book of the Wicked musical) and Dana Fox (Cruella) and directed by Jon M. Chu (Now You See Me 2, Crazy Rich Asians), Wicked begins around the time The Wizard of Oz ends. The Wicked Witch of the West has died and Glinda the Good Witch is breaking the news to Munchkinland. As the munchkins celebrate and burn a giant, Wicker Man-style witch in celebration of the witch’s death, Glinda is asked by one of the munchkins if she knew the witch.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is nearly three hours of how a green-skinned, outcast girl named Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) whose emotions spark wondrous fits of unbelievable magic interacts with the spoiled, entitled, and pink-infatuated Galinda (Ariana Grande) as they enroll in a magic school known as Shiz University.\r\n\r\nVisually, Wicked is jaw-dropping and beautiful. All of the talking animals look extraordinary and every sequence with the flying monkeys is a visual highlight. Peter Dinklage voices a goat teacher named Dr. Dillamond and he has one of the most emotional arcs in the film. The bear nurse and dog doctor in the opening moments of the film look so good for what little amount of screen time they have.\r\n\r\nGiven how many VFX teams are credited in the film, it’s no wonder the CGI looks intricately gorgeous. The three VFX teams with the most credits in Wicked include OPSIS (The Fall Guy, Rescue Rangers), Framestore (Gladiator II, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice), and ILM (Venom: The Last Dance, Alien: Romulus). Then there’s various work from about a dozen different other VFX teams/houses, but the most intriguing one is one called FoyProAI.\r\n\r\nFoyProAI doesn’t have an accessible official website, but some digging around on an executive producer’s LinkedIn page gives some background. Foy stands for Fountains of Youth and FoyProAI specializes in de-aging, up-aging, and beauty work in film. They’ve worked on Smile 2, John Woo’s The Killer for Peacock, and 400 shots on Wicked.\r\n\r\nThere are moments of greatness in Wicked that mostly stem from the chemistry between Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande. Grande’s comedic roots, specifically her time and experience on SNL, really come into play here. Grande is essentially the comedic relief as Galinda as her outgoing personality carries most sequences while Erivo has more of a straightforward performance that has more of a dry delivery.\r\n\r\nBut the generic musical formula is infuriating. Story beats pause and go out of their way to cater to multiple songs at times and it logically hurts your brain. Yes, it’s a musical and yes people are going to sing. But when the main characters are trying to get away on a flying broom as guards are pounding at the door and they spend another ten minutes dancing, crying, and bellowing about their broken friendship it becomes a nuisance. Get on the damn broom and sing on the way to your destination. It doesn’t seem that hard.\r\n\r\nSome sequences are thrown in solely because they’ll make a big song more appealing (the whole rotating library straight out of Inception thing) or side stories that don’t go anywhere because two characters need to seem closer than they are (Elphaba and Fiyero’s awkward ten-minute excursion into the forest to free a lion cub). These are both roundabout executions that take the long way to showcase that Fiyero thinks reading is dumb and that he’s actually in love with Elphaba over Galinda.\r\n\r\nThe film adaptation seems like it’s quite faithful to its source material, but the Hollywood concept of transforming nasty and recognizable villains into sad, relatable characters that the audience roots for is a dumpster fire of a concept. Pure asshole villains can be fantastic too and often make protagonists more interesting if done right.\r\n\r\nBut the musical fantasy film treats Elphaba like dirt for the first hour and a half. Everyone looks down on her because of the color of her skin. Then when she finally becomes friends with Galinda, she develops a soft spot for mistreated animals. It’s the main reason she turns against The Wizard of Oz (Jeff Goldblum) apart from being one of the only characters who can read magic spells.\r\n\r\nWicked is Mean Girls at Hogwarts as everybody sucks and is superficial apart from a character that is supposed to be evil. Elphaba mostly accepts the role of wicked witch because her beliefs don’t match anyone else’s and she’s unwilling to adapt to their ways solely to keep the peace.\r\n\r\nWicked features some unreal VFX and even touches on some incredible ideas from time to time, but the ideas that work seem to stem from capitalizing on a fantasy world that was established over a century ago. As a film, Wicked conjures song after song and drags on and on solely because it’s a bloated musical that wants you to die a rhythmic, sometimes undecipherable, high-pitched death.",

  "content": "*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*\r\n\r\nI've been a Wicked fan since 2010. My expectations for this film were extremely high! And I was blown away by how Jon M. Chu was able to bring this story a new life. Everyone involved did an excellent job! The choice to sing live paid off! Not one note was out of tune! Bowen Yang & Bronwyn James were absolutely hilarious as Phannee & Shen Shen. Marissa Bode was fantastic as Nessarose. Can't wait to see her story continue in Part 2. I hope they include \"Wicked Witch of the East\" in the Part 2 Soundtrack. Ethan Slater was great as Boq. I'm excited to see how he becomes the Tin Man in Part 2 because that's not shown on stage. He transforms behind the cabinet but I hope we actually see it in Part 2. Michelle Yeoh was great in every scene as Madam Morrible. She was very Wicked! Jeff Goldblum was amazing as The Wizard! I loved the new version of The Grimmerie! The way it opened was very cool! Jonathan Bailey was incredibly charming as Fiyero! Dancing Through Life was very well choreographed and his singing was great! Loved the way he met Elphaba in this version. I'm very intrigued to see him become The Scarecrow in Part 2. Ariana Grande was absolutely phenomenal as Glinda! She embodied everything about Glinda! Loved her homages to past Glindas in Popular. Her voice was very Angelic. You can tell that she studied a lot for this role. Can't wait to hear her \"I'm Not That Girl (Reprise)\". Cynthia Erivo stole the show as Elphaba Thropp. She poured her heart into this character! I'm so excited to hear \"No Good Deed\" in Part 2! She was incredible! As for the Cameos in One Short Day, Loved seeing Stephen Schwartz as The Guard & Winnie Holtzman as an Emerald City Resident. Love the expansion of the Wizomania show to include Kristin & Idina telling the story of The Grimmerie. Loved that Idina did her Elphie Battle Cry. It didn't take away from Cynthia's at the End. The Film was meant to happen in 2024. Had it come out in 2016 or 2019, I don't think it would've been as well done as it was! I can't wait to see Part 2 and how much of The Wizard of Oz they include. I hope we get to see Dorothy's Face. 10/10 No Notes.",

  "content": "OK, so I'm going to be swimming against the tide a bit with this, but I didn't love it. We start where the \"Wizard of Oz\" story finishes off, only without the catchy \"Ding Dong the Witch is...\". Instead we get an ensemble dance number that is energetically performed, colourful and expertly choreographed but instantly forgettable. Then we meet \"Galinda\" (Ariana Grande) who arrives in her pink bubble to confirm the news and enjoy the celebrations. Turns out, though, that she and the erstwhile \"Wicked Witch of the West\" were once friends and so back in time we go to the birth of a little green baby who may (or may not) have been conceived within the bounds of happily married wedlock. Scoot on many years more and we discover that said green person - \"Elphaba\" (Cynthia Erivo) is accompanying her wheelchair bound sister \"Nessarose\" (Marissa Bode) to the \"Ozian\" equivalent of \"Hogwarts\" where she encounters the snobbish \"Galinda\" and a fairly comprehensive degree of hostility. Luckily for her, the legendary sorceress \"Madame Morrible\" (Michelle Yeoh) spots some hidden talent in this young woman and soon she is sharing rooms with her new nemesis and finding herself the butt of school jokes. Then enter the mischievous prince \"Fiyero\" (Jonathan Bailey) who tends to treat everyone the same and who's been kicked out of more schools that he can shake a sceptre at. He does, however, manage to create an environment in which everyone can get along and that's when things begin to change for an \"Elphaba\" who is to be made likeable by her now pally roomie. When a letter arrives from the all-powerful Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) summoning her to the \"Emerald City\", then they set off hoping to find answers to all of their questions, only to find that nothing there is as it seems... I have to admit that JB has been a friend of mine for many years, so I ain't going to be saying anything bad about the man who might just be the next \"007\", and both Erivo and Grande do well enough with the set piece musical numbers - especially the lively and cleverly written \"Populer/lar\", but the rest of this just struck me as \"Harry Potter\" goes to the musicals where it meets \"Mean Girls\". Goldblum makes his presence felt, but in the same slightly affected fashion that he aways does, and though the visual effects are all fantastic, somehow they are all just so much more sterile to watch than when you see them within the confines of a theatrical stage - where this works so much better, and without the need for the commercially exploitative part 1 and part 2 released months apart. To be fair, everyone looks like they are enjoying themselves, there's a fun number from Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth and Bailey brings some much needed charm to the proceedings but I'd probably just prefer a director's cut that offered us the whole story in one three hour chunk so we can get that mediocre \"Defying Gravity\" power ballad out of the way (repeatedly) in one fell swoop. It's a very polished production, and maybe the hype has just got to me, but I can't pretend I wasn't disappointed by this. Wilted more than wicked, sorry.",

  "content": "It’s quite a rare occurrence these days when a much-anticipated film actually lives up to all of its pre-release hype, but this screen adaptation of the hit Broadway musical truly does so in every regard. Director Jon M. Chu has brilliantly brought to life the back story behind the lives and relationship of the two witches from the original L. Frank Baum novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900) and its 1939 classic screen adaptation, as well as Gregory Maguire’s 1995 prequel novel, Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West. In this stunningly beautiful and delightful big-screen production, viewers learn how the supposedly evil Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) came to know the purportedly Glinda the Good (Ariana Grande-Butera), sorcery students and college roommates whose relationship initially went through a series of changes from unabashed contempt to solid friendship. However, as high-level political intrigue unfolds in their homeland of the magical land of Oz – efforts clandestinely spearheaded by the supposedly all-powerful Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) and university headmistress Mme. Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) – Elphaba and Glinda become unwittingly caught up in the high-stakes subterfuge playing out around them, a development that jeopardizes the future of their friendship and the stability of Oz itself. The filmmaker thus subtly but effectively presents audiences with a fable on the nature of good and evil, particularly in terms of what actually constitutes wickedness, especially when it’s skillfully veiled. The result is a thoughtful and thoroughly entertaining tale replete with stunning musical numbers, excellent choreography, ample humor, gorgeous cinematography, an inspired production design and superb performances by the four principals, all of whom are certain to be strong awards season candidates (quite a recommendation coming from someone who unapologetically makes no claim to being a fan of musicals). More than that, though, “Wicked” is an insightful treatise on the quest for power and learning how to make judicious use of it, both in personal dealings and in matters of wider consequence, a fitting cautionary tale for our times (or any time, for that matter). If I had any complaint here, it would be my concern that this is yet another example of a story that’s been divided up into two installments, a growing trend that I don’t believe will ultimately serve the movie industry well. According to the director, this was seen as a necessary step to do justice to the source material, given that it would have been nearly impossible to cram everything into one picture without doing major damage to the content. And, to give the filmmaker the benefit of the doubt, perhaps that will ultimately prove true with the release of part 2 in 2025 (but I’ll reserve judgment on that for the time being). In the meantime, though, this first part comes through as promised, and, in this day and age, that’s a cinematic miracle in itself.",

  "content": "Very good! I enjoyed <em>'Wicked'</em>.\r\n\r\nAlways impressive when a long run time flashes by - no doubt a sign of a sturdy movie. 2hr 40mins is how long this one lasts, I thought I might have felt that whilst watching but, honestly, I didn't. Since sharing my reviews online I have appreciated musicals much more, to the point that when I learn a film is from this genre it barely registers.\r\n\r\nI have never seen the stage musical, in fact the only detail I knew for certain was that it was from the world of <em>'The Wizard of Oz'</em> - which, in turn, I only know from the 1939 and 2013 movies, as well as one or two other flicks. As such, I wasn't actually sure where they were heading with the Wicked Witch of the West - but I approve.\r\n\r\nCynthia Erivo impresses as the aforementioned. I have to say, mind, that Ariana Grande is the person onscreen that stood out most. She does an excellent job at making her character's self-centered quirks so convincing, while also producing a few amusing moments too. Jonathan Bailey and Peter Dinklage are good, while Jeff Goldblum certainly fits his role.\r\n\r\nThe ending, whilst perfectly fine and pleasing, is possibly a bit rushed/abrupt, though that's to be expected given it's only part one. The same can be said for most films that are split into multiple productions, to be fair. I am intrigued to see where part two goes, bring on this time next year.\r\n\r\nThe music is, as one would expect, also a positive. Granted I don't think I'll be adding any of the tracks to my playlist, but I still had a pleasant time hearing all the songs come and go - not one sticks out like a sore thumb, so that's good. Elsewhere, visually and plot-wise I have no real complaints.",

  "content": "https://good.film/guide/haters-will-tell-you-wicked-sucks-heres-why-theyre-wrong\r\n\r\nBroadway hits rely on a suspension of disbelief. With the right ingredients, even the oddest of ideas can take flight on stage… but in the delicate translation to screen, they crash-land. Take Cats: something about that core premise of humans playing felines – which theatre audiences lapped up (sorry) for decades – just didn’t work at the movies.\r\n\r\nFrom the outside, it’s easy to paint Wicked with the same brush. Isn’t it all a bit… silly? There’s a blonde Godiva who floats in a bubble. A green woman who was raised by a bear (and whose father may or may not be a wizard). And when they meet at a Hogwarts-style university, we find out their professor, Dr. Dillamond, is a talking goat. These aren’t exactly the trappings of a thoughtful, award-winning piece of drama. But peel back the colours of any GOOD fantasy and you’ll usually find the allegories are rich and meaningful. With its themes of parental guilt, absent fatherhood, disability, discrimination and class supremacy, Wicked is no exception.\r\n\r\nLook, we’re not saying Wicked’s perfect. At 2 hours 40 minutes, it’s knocking HARD on the “too long, wrap it up!” door. And there’s characters that either overdo it a bit (Governor Thropp) or arguably, don’t add much at all (oh Pfannee, do you even go to this school?).\r\n\r\nBut that’s a bit like complaining about a scratch on a speedboat. A sleek, wondrous craft that can whiz you somewhere thrilling, and change you along the way. We didn’t have crazy high expectations – hey, the everyday moviegoer isn’t a hardcore Broadway fan – but honestly? You don’t need to be. Wicked is a movie for anyone. And maybe that’s why it feels so GOOD.",

I HATED the trailer, where it made the film look like it was baked with plastic, glossy CGI, or even worse Gen-AI.\r\n\r\nAnd I was wrong.\r\n\r\nErivo and Grande are stellar. The co-stars aren't who I'd have picked, but they're quite excellent themselves. (Particularly the folks playing Bok and Nessa.) \r\n\r\nIt's a glorious, beautiful, and joyful film in many ways. When Elphaba finally soars, my heart soared as well and I found myself tearing up. \r\n\r\nI also appreciated how it gives a nod to the much, much darker book, especially with the propaganda posters and effigy in the opening, and the various references to Oz's takeover. (Like when the stone edifice falls off the side of the school building revealing the animals beneath.)\r\n\r\nMy only complaint is, as with any two or three-parter, lots of the filler is garbage. This is especially true  of the Dancing Through Life number, which becomes unbearably long and significantly less magical because of the added content. \r\n\r\nStill, highly recommended. 8/10 Stars.",

  "content": "Wicked by Jon M. Chu is an ambitious adaptation that largely delivers on its promise to bring the magic of the beloved musical to the big screen. Visually, the movie is stunning, with vibrant set pieces and a cinematic take on Oz that feels both familiar and fresh. Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba brings an emotional depth that truly captures the character’s struggles, while Ariana Grande’s Glinda adds a balance of charm and humor. Together, their performances anchor the film and make the story’s core themes, friendship, identity, and societal perception, shine.\r\n\r\nThe musical numbers are undeniably the movie’s highlight. Songs like \"Defying Gravity\" are powerful and beautifully staged, though I couldn’t help but feel the choreography, while good, could have been taken a step further to truly elevate the experience. The pacing is a mixed bag, with the first act taking its time to set the stage, which may feel slow for some. That said, once the story finds its rhythm, it balances the emotional beats with grandeur fairly well, though the shifts in tone could have been smoothed out more.\r\n\r\nOverall, Wicked succeeds as a visually impressive and emotionally resonant adaptation, even if it stumbles in a few places. It’s a solid film for fans of the musical and newcomers alike. While there’s room for improvement, particularly in pacing and choreography, it’s hard to deny that the performances and visual storytelling make it a worthwhile watch.",

  "content": "Heist movies – particularly those with a finely honed comic edge – have become one of the most popular and enjoyable genres in today’s cinematic marketplace. And, when they’re done right, they can be a lot of fun, too. However, to succeed as solid entertainment vehicles (not to mention works of good filmmaking), their creators need to combine their films’ various elements with smart, savvy, razor sharp precision, something that director Tim Story’s latest offering only gets down pat about half the time. When Zoe (Keke Palmer), a shrewd, scheming, seductive thief, hatches an elaborate plan to hijack an armored car for use in stealing the weekend receipts from an Atlantic City casino, she taps a variety of resources to make it work, including gathering inside information from a bumbling security guard/driver, Travis (Pete Davidson), during a convincingly staged romantic encounter that he believes is genuine and not the cleverly disguised ruse that it is. His ineptitude and naivete, in turn, lead to a daring, high-speed highway chase that results in the theft of the vehicle and ends up embroiling Travis and his seasoned partner, Russell (Eddie Murphy), in a high-stakes caper to swipe $60 million in cash. And, to ensure the duo’s assistance, Zoe reveals that she has Russell’s wife, Natalie (Eva Longoria), under surveillance – and under the threat of violence – if he and Travis don’t cooperate in carrying out her scheme. By all rights, this might sound like a grounded premise for a film of this stripe, and that would have likely proved true with better execution in several key areas. However, as far as releases like this are concerned, “The Pickup” is, unfortunately, a mostly mediocre offering. To its credit, the film sports a modest number of thrill-filled moments, a fair amount of genuinely funny bits and some truly kick-ass chase scenes. It also features a standout performance by Palmer (who really deserves to get better roles than this), as well as capable turns by Longoria and by Andrew Dice Clay as Travis and Russell’s surly, foul-mouthed boss. But the script needs some serious work, given its many plot holes, implausible story elements and generous helpings of predictability, many of which represent missed opportunities that could have been employed in making the narrative more inventive, unexpected and engaging. Then there are the performances of Davidson, who hands viewers yet another cloying, obnoxious portrayal, and Murphy, whose deadpan delivery often makes him look like he’s sleepwalking through the picture save for a few over-the-top comic outbursts that seem incongruent and largely out of character. Admittedly, this offering generally improves the further one gets into the story, but it still comes up disappointingly short overall. With some precision retooling in the writing and more effective character development and direction for the leads, this truly could have been so much better. As it stands now, though, it’s not only the casino that’s getting robbed.",

Obviously the writing et al. lets this one down just as much, but it was more visually that made me care less about it - it's an ugly film, especially 'inside' that damn truck.\r\n\r\nThe world of film didn't feel lived in either, namely on that long highway; I know they mention it'll be a \"ghost town\" but that's a cop-out. The pairing, meanwhile, of Eddie Murphy and Pete Davidson is narrowly passable, albeit arguably. Davidson is the better, Murphy underwhelms.\r\n\r\nKeke Palmer is the star of this particular show, her performance gave the flick the required energy anyway. Eva Longoria is alright, at least for the forgettable role that she is given. The characters of Jack Kesy and Ismael Cruz Córdova are exactly that too, despite having potential to be decent.\r\n\r\nIt's the ending that stopped me from disliking this 2025 release. It holds enough action that I was satisifed with what I was watching.

  "content": "The working class and down on their luck Kim family struggle to make ends meet. When a friend of the son, Ki-Woo’s, who is an English tutor for the daughter in the wealthy Park family, has to leave his position, he recommends Ki-Woo for the job. Now having an \"in\" with the wealthy family, the Kims begin plotting the downfall of the current household servants and inserting themselves into those vacant positions, making them all gainfully employed and with money finally flowing into the household. But not everything is as it seems in the Park house or with their previous servants.\r\n\r\nThis movie starts out as a comedy and quickly goes into social commentary, pointing out the differences between the poor working class family and the wealthy privileged family. The differences are ones that get commonly pointed out with the well-to-do having what usually gets termed as first-world-problems, while the poor family is literally trying to survive and save meager possessions in a flood. It doesn’t shy away or try to be subtle about it, but interestingly enough, we don’t feel beaten over the head with it either, which is a major change from the ham-fisted approach taken by most filmmakers. Couching this in a comedy is a good approach, as well, as the audience’s guard is let down and we become more receptive to the ideas.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do say it’s MOSTLY a comedy. The third act takes a dark, dark turn, and the contrast, not to mention general disdain and even indifference, between the classes becomes much more severe. This gets into some hard territory, and characters that we’ve found quirky and even come to like in some ways show very different sides of themselves. At the same time, it doesn’t feel unexpected, almost like we could tell that this was under the surface all the time and tried to ignore it, but aren’t surprised by it when it does show up. This is some masterful characterization!\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of note is that this film is rich in allegory and metaphor. It’s a smart film, yet at the same time the filmmakers are not condescending about it. They give the audience credit for being able to understand the symbolism and don’t spoon feed you everything, which is a refreshing change from the usual head-beating most filmmakers go for. At the same time, they understand that not every audience member will understand or immediately pick up on every symbol, but they have crafted this so carefully and so perfectly that you don’t have to understand each and every one. That understanding merely enriches the experience, but isn’t essential to it.\r\n\r\nThis film has gotten some recognition, and deservedly so. It is rich, intelligent, and polished to a degree that we sadly don’t see as often as we should nowadays, showing the filmmakers are masters of their craft. This is easily one of the best films I’ve seen in 2019. Highly recommended!",

Parasite is easily the best movie I've seen since the Big Short. Joon Ho's compelling ease of execution alongside the effortless lure of the plot's trappings had me hooked in an instant. I would have been happy watching this family fold pizza boxes for two hours. The story, like the family, takes on a life of its own, rapidly elevating to a setup impossible to sustain. The Bunuelesque occupy-the-rich scheme gleefully, blissfully ascends to lofty heights only, inevitably, to hit the fatal fan. The poor buggers ultimately find themselves literally chin deep in their own sh*t. The hotsy-totsy aristocrats, meanwhile, host a lovely garden party that flips into a tragic Shakespearean bloodbath. It's all fun and games till someone loses a daughter. (Note to the rich: Check the references of new hires and think twice before inviting riffraff to your afternoon functions). Decades in the making, the implosion of a middle income buffer and a widening disparity between social classes make Parasite a must-see for all income brackets. You don't have to be rich or detest or envy the rich to enjoy this instant classic. But please, whatever you do, don't try this a home, folks. Never combine the rich and poor without safety goggles or outside the confines of a controlled and supervised laboratory setting.",

You know, this summer I was starting to get a little worn out with the endless sequels, remakes and soulless crash grabs, so I find it refreshing we get movies like this once awhile.\r\n\r\nI admire Bong Joon-Ho as a director, especially his Korean movies.

And the comedy is actually hilarious and well written with the execution being sold on the actors. The thing I love so much is how funny, thrilling and intense the movie can be, hijacking all senses and emotions all wrapped into one - only a few directors can pull something this unique.\r\n\r\nThe performances from everyone was brilliant and there's so much depth to each character, they make the movie as captivating as it is. The cinematography was beautiful, the music was remarkable, and the movie says so much it's the reason why I was engaged throughout.\r\n\r\nI highly recommend people to avoid knowing anything before going in, because trust me it will add to your experience.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: Finally, a breath of fresh air. My second favorite movie of this year.",

  "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nYes, I know. I'm late as hell. I don't really have anything to offer you besides my personal opinion. Theses and video essays are breaking down Parasite at such a deep level that I can't really write anything new. Nevertheless, I'll share my thoughts on it because it would be a massive miss from someone who considers himself as a film critic. I had this movie on my watchlist since last summer, but I kept delaying it, underestimating my time. So, no, I'm not just watching Parasite because it won Best Picture at the Oscars, I always planned on it.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, yes, I also love it like most people, and no, I'm not writing this because I'm \"following the pack\". Bong Joon Ho simply delivered one of 2019's best films, and it's definitely cracking a spot in my Top10. I really enjoyed what Bong did with Okja, and I'm a massive fan of Snowpiercer. Therefore, this isn't just another South Korean flick. It's directed and co-written by someone who has been proving himself for quite some time. Even though I still defend that Sam Mendes deserved to win Best Director for his work on 1917, I'm more than happy that a foreign movie finally won Best Picture, and what a film to do it!\r\n\r\nIt can be described as a dark dramedy, but I think social satire is more adequate. The differences between the rich and the poor are beautifully shown on-screen exclusively through visuals. There's so little exposition, which is one of the reasons why Parasite has one of 2019's best screenplays. The balance between explaining something and leaving it ambiguous is perfect. Throughout the runtime, Bong Joon Ho leans on an actor's face so that the audience can understand what that character is feeling through its expressions, which will explain its actions later on.\r\n\r\nThere's a sequence that surely has been heavily discussed for the past months. It's raining, and Bong cleverly divides the screen with how the wealthy family is dealing with it against the poor neighborhood where the Kim family comes from. The gorgeous cinematography, the unforgettable musical score, the seamless editing... Everything about this sequence is technically flawless, and it carries such an emotionally powerful message. Something astonishing and beautiful to look at for some can be a horrible disaster for others.\r\n\r\nIt's a movie that balances a lot of tones. In ten minutes, the tone goes from funny to dramatic to suspenseful to scary to absolute tragedy... and it all feels incredibly realistic. That's one of my major compliments to Parasite: I never felt like it was fiction. I never thought \"this is too much, this would never occur\". Even in the third act, where the narrative takes some bold decisions, everything makes sense with what had been shown until then. From shocking character actions to surprising plot points, Bong and Han Jin-won's screenplay is excellent.\r\n\r\nEveryone in the cast is fantastic, but Song Kang-ho is the standout, in my opinion. His role as the father of the Kim family is brilliant. I'm actually surprised he wasn't nominated for Best Actor in more award shows. I created a connection with this family in such a way that the ending truly impacted me. It's tough to deny that the writing is what makes Parasite the phenomenon that so many people fell in love with, myself included.\r\n\r\nTechnically, I don't have any defects to point out. It's one of those films that I firmly believe in having virtually no flaws. I'm in love with the score, I gasped several times at the impressive cinematography, and the editing is perfect. Whatever genre the story decides to go to, it's always entertaining and extremely captivating. Its comedy is very smart, and it made me laugh a lot of times. Its dramatic storylines kept my eyes always focused on what was happening. Even when it briefly delves into the horror territory, it's more suspenseful and scary than most of that genre's flicks nowadays.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Parasite genuinely surprised me. With so many people hyping it to a ridiculously high level, my expectations were very moderate. Nevertheless, I love it as much or more as everyone else. I know that watching it this late can make some people question my opinion/rating, but I would never love a movie because I \"should\" or because other people do. It deserves every award it received, especially the ones concerning the screenplay. It's one of the best original stories of the last few years, and it's written in such a brilliant manner, with beautiful visual storytelling instead of the overused exposition. An emotionally resonant message is present throughout the whole runtime, and the various tones are balanced seamlessly. Technically flawless: cinematography, score, editing... everything's absolutely perfect. Nothing is placed without purpose. Not a single line of dialogue is wasted. Bong Joon Ho is a phenomenal filmmaker, one that cares about the art and everything that comes with it. He truly put his heart and soul into this, and it would be a shame if anyone fails to watch this magnificent movie just because it's in a foreign language. Please, don't make such an awful mistake...\r\n\r\nRating: A+",

  "content": "**_An uncategorisable masterpiece_**\r\n\r\n>_We fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service – two dishes, but to one table._\r\n\r\n- William Shakespeare; _The Tragicall Historie of Hamlet Prince of Denmarke_, 4.iii.23-24 (1599-1601)\r\n\r\nWhat is one to make of the utterly uncategorisable and impossible-to-define _Gisaengchung_ [_Parasite_]? Only the third film to win both the Palme d'Or and the Academy Award for Best Picture, after Billy Wilder's _The Lost Weekend_ (1945) and Delbert Mann's _Marty_ (1955), _Parasite_ is one of the best-reviewed films of the century thus far and caused huge waves when it became the first non-English language film to win Best Picture. Co-writer and director Bong Joon-ho also tied with Walt Disney for the most Oscars awarded to one person in one night – four (Best Picture, Best Foreign Language Film, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay). On top of that, he became the first person in history to win more than three Oscars for a single film. In short, Parasite has had a significant, and relatively unexpected, impact.\r\n\r\nBut what exactly is _Parasite_? Described on its official website as a \"_pitch-black modern fairy-tale_\", even a comprehensive plot summary wouldn't adequately delineate its real nature – part comedy of manners, part social satire, part heist film, part thriller, part horror, part family drama, part farce, part economic treatise, part social realism, part tragedy, part allegory. And that's just the opening scene! It's the _Ulysses_ of cinema, adopting and shedding genres so often and so seamlessly that it effectively becomes its own genre. And, like _Ulysses_, it's exceptional in just about every way – screenplay (co-written by Bong and Han Jin-won), directing, cinematography, _mise en scène_, editing, production design, sound design, score, acting. There's not a weak link here, in a film that achieves that rarest of things – it lives up to the hype.\r\n\r\nThe Kim family are down on their luck. Father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin), daughter Ki-jeong (Park So-dam), and son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) reside in a tiny basement apartment, with their only window looking out onto a popular urination spot in a back alley. With all four unemployed, they eke out a meagre living folding pizza boxes for a nearby restaurant. However, their fortunes change when Ki-Woo meets Min-hyuk (Park Seo-joon), a childhood friend who is now at university. Min-hyuk works as an English tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family, but he's soon to leave Korea, and so suggests that Ki-Woo take over. Armed with a fake diploma created by Ki-jeong on Photoshop, Ki-Woo successfully applies for the job. The Park family, father Dong-ik, (Lee Sun-kyun), mother Yeon-gyo (Cho Yeo-jeong), daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), and son Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun), welcomes Ki-woo into their lavish home, and upon discovering just how wealthy the Parks are, the Kims hatch an elaborate scheme to oust the Park's current domestic staff and take their places. And so, hiding the fact that they're all related, Ki-taek is hired as a chauffeur, Chung-Sook as a housekeeper, and Ki-jeong as an art therapist for Da-song. However, it doesn't take long before things start to go very, very awry for both families, in ways none of them (or the audience) could ever have imagined.\r\n\r\nWe live in an era where wealth is distributed upwards and the gap between the haves and have-nots is wider than ever. According to inequality.org, the richest 1% of the world's population controls 45% of global wealth. At the same time, adults with less than $10,000 capital make up 64% of the population and control less than 1% of the wealth. In 2018, Oxfam reported that the wealth of the 26 richest people in the world was equal to the combined wealth of the 3.5 billion poorest people. This is the _milieu_ of _Parasite_, a film which taps into some of the same ideological thinking as gave rise to \"_Hell Joseon_\" sentiments, wherein up to 75% of Koreans aged 19-34 want to leave the country. \r\n\r\nObviously enough, Bong's main themes are class division and class conflict, the artificiality of societal hierarchy, and the concomitant social inequality and differentiation in status that makes such a hierarchy possible in the first place. As thoroughly entertaining (and funny) as the film is, it remains, in essence, an economic treatise, albeit with a savagely satirical quality. However, make no mistake, this is a satire with teeth – the hilarity and playfulness of the long first act give way to a darker political vibe in the second, before Bong violently deconstructs his own allegory in the emotionally draining and batshit insane third act, ultimately driving the knife home in an epilogue that's about as different from the film's early scenes as you could imagine. Of course, this is far from the first time Bong has dealt with issues of class, touching obliquely on similar themes in _Sarinui Chueok_ [_Memories of Murder_] (2003), _Gwoemul_ [_The Host_] (2006), and _Madeo_ [_Mother_] (2009). _Parasite_'s engagement with class and economics, however, is far more overt, aligning it with Bong's English-language work, _Snowpiercer_ (2013) and _Okja_ (2015). Never before, however, has he been this caustic, this acerbic, but so too this compassionate, this witty. Indeed, _Parasite_ feels like a culmination, the film to which he's been building for his entire career.\r\n\r\nIn the film's press notes, Bong states;\r\n\r\n>_I think that one way to portray the continuing polarisation and inequality of our society is as a sad comedy. We are living in an era when capitalism is the reigning order, and we have no other alternative. It's not just in Korea, but the entire world faces a situation where the tenets of capitalism cannot be ignored. In the real world, the paths of families like our four unemployed protagonists and the Park family are unlikely ever to cross. The only instance is in matters of employment between classes, as when someone is hired as a tutor or a domestic worker. In such cases there are moments when the two classes come into close enough proximity to feel each other's breath. In this film, even though there is no malevolent intention either side, the two classes are pulled into a situation where the slightest slip can lead to fissures and eruptions. In today's capitalistic society there are ranks and castes that are invisible to the eye. We keep them disguised and out of sight, and superficially look down on class hierarchies as a relic of the past, but the reality is that there are class lines that cannot be crossed._\r\n\r\nIn this manner, the film works as a literalisation of the theory that co-existence between the various classes is becoming increasingly difficult; the Kims and the Parks aren't simply differentiated due to wealth, rather they live in completely different worlds and have vastly different, and largely incompatible, ideologies.\r\n\r\nOne of the most deftly-handled elements of the film is Bong's avoidance of the clichés one so often finds in films dealing with economics – the Kims are by no means the default protagonists, a victimised family immediately worthy of sympathy, whilst the Parks are by no means the default antagonists, a callous family immediately worthy of scorn. Rather, the Parks are depicted as perfectly friendly and pleasant whilst the Kims are shown to be liars and scoundrels. Indeed, it's the Kims who are the more crassly materialistic of the two families – obsessed with their mobile phones and WhatsApp, we first meet them as they're wandering around their apartment, phones held aloft, trying to pick up their neighbour's WiFi signal. Later, as they ingratiate themselves with the Parks and acquire more and more access to a wealthy lifestyle, all four Kims start to carry themselves differently, as if being in such proximity to wealth has had a physiological effect. \r\n\r\nThere are no heroes and villains here – Bong is uninterested in trucking in black and white oppositions because such rigid diametrics aren't the norm in the real world. For all their scheming and lying, the Kims merely con their way into menial jobs, trying to earn enough to make survival a little easier. As for the Parks, their wealth has insulated them from the world of families such as the Kims, but their greatest crimes are disconnection and ignorance, nothing more. At the same time, the Kims are depicted as a far more unified and loving family than the Parks. Although all four Kims regularly occupy the same frame, to the best of my recollection, we never see the four Parks together in the same shot; Da-hye and Da-song rarely leave their rooms, Yeon-gyo spends most of her time in the kitchen and living room, and Dong-ik is seen most regularly in his car. It's a wonderful bit of cinematic shorthand to convey a thematic point, with Bong utilising the visual component of the medium to maximum effect – this is a filmmaker who knows precisely what he's doing.\r\n\r\nIt's in relation to the two family's status as heroes or villains that the film's title is so important. Strictly speaking, the Korean title, \"_기생충_\" (\"gisaengchung\"), means \"helminth\" rather than \"parasite\", but as a helminth is a parasitic worm, the slight difference in the translation isn't a big deal. In any case, a parasitic organism such as a helminth lives in or on a host and takes its nourishment from that host. A simple reading of this is that the Kims are the parasites and the Parks are the hosts, with the Kims feeding off the Parks' wealth and status. However, in a film where nothing is as it seems, things aren't that simple. Bong depicts the Parks as parasites as well – they've been rendered relatively helpless by their wealth, unable to complete basic tasks such as driving or cleaning without the assistant of working-class employees; i.e. they sustain themselves based off of the labour of their servants. And so, just as the Kims feed off the Parks, the Parks feed off the Kims, in what quickly becomes a symbiotic relationship. Concerning this issue, in his Director's Statement, Bong says,\r\n\r\n>_it is increasingly the case in this sad world that humane relationships based on co-existence or symbiosis cannot hold, and one group is pushed into a parasitic relationship with another. In the midst of such a world, who can point their finger at a struggling family, locked in a fight for survival, and call them parasites? It's not that they were parasites from the start. They are our neighbours, friends and colleagues, who have merely been pushed to the edge of a precipice._\r\n\r\nHowever, as strong as the film is narratively and thematically, it also has an aesthetic design to die for. Hong Kyung-pyo's cinematography, for example, is magnificent. Hong also shot Lee Chang-dong's superb _Beoning_ (2018), and the camerawork here has a similar smoothness and restlessness, gliding through the Parks house like it's a fifth member of the Kim family. Lee Ha-jun's production design is also praise-worthy, with the Kims' and Parks' living conditions contrasted in every way; the Parks live in a pristine post-modernist semi-open plan house, accessible only by an electronically controlled gate, and hidden from the street by tall trees and dense shrubs; the Kims, on the other hand, live in a cluttered and dilapidated apartment with barely any room, their toilet situated beside the aforementioned window looking into an alley.\r\n\r\nIt's also in relation to production design wherein one of the film's best metaphors is to be found, which is also a great example of just how much of a masterwork this is, how completely Bong is in control of his craft. As a film at least partly in the tradition of the \"upstairs/downstairs\" subgenre (think James Ivory's _The Remains of the Day_ or Robert Altman's _Gosford Park_), Bong literalises the separation between those above and those below insofar as stairways are a recurring motif. The Kims live in a basement apartment without stairs, mirroring their stagnation and inability to rise in a socio-economic sense. On the other hand, the Parks' lavish home has two main stairways – one going up, the other going down into the cellar. As Ki-jeong and Ki-woo gain more access to Da-song and Da-hye, they start to spend most of their time upstairs. Ki-taek and Chung-sook, however, along with Dong-ik and Yeon-gyo, spend most of their time downstairs, indicating a fissure between the adults and their children. The stairway to the cellar is its own unique animal, with Bong shooting it like he's suddenly directing a horror film (there's a thematic reason for this that I can't go into without spoilers). In this way, he bestows upon it an ominousness that, at first, makes little sense, but ultimately reveals itself to be a spectacular bit of foreshadowing. There's also a third stairway in the Park home, one not revealed until late in the second act, but one which has huge narrative and thematic importance.\r\n\r\n_Parasite_ is a masterpiece, with Bong, operating at the peak of his abilities, never putting a foot wrong. It could have been a self-serving and didactic message-movie – a homily to the honour of the poor or a deconstruction of the unhappiness of the rich – but Bong is far too talented for that, avoiding rhetorical cant, and allowing the film to find its own space. Quite unlike anything I've ever seen, it works as allegory just as well as it works as social realism just as well as it works as comedy just as well as it works as tragedy, and so on. This is cinema as art; it's the best Palme d'Or winner since Terrence Malick's _The Tree of Life_ in 2011 and the best Best Picture winner since Kevin Costner's _Dances with Wolves_ in 1990. Bong is currently working with HBO to develop a limited series English-language adaptation, which fills me with dread, but no matter what happens with that project, no matter how good (or bad) it may be, here in 2020, Parasite has proven itself very much a game-changer, a film that deserves every bit of praise it's received.",

Thankfully, the movie itself is very good, it's one I enjoyed quite a bit. The animation is class, the lions look amazingly majestic. I will say the white ones look a bit iffy, but that's nothing even close to a big issue.\r\n\r\nThe voice cast are all perfectly good. Aaron Pierre, Kelvin Harrison Jr. (only now realising his character wasn't called Tucker... bit embarrassing on my part), John Kani et al. all merit props. The standouts for me, however, are Mads Mikkelsen and Lennie James - two actors I do love watching (or listening to, in this case), admittedly.\r\n\r\nMusic-wise, it's not the strongest - I can't recall any of the songs, to be honest. That's not actually a terrible thing though, as it means none of the musical numbers grated on me either - and that's always a win in my books. Elsewhere, Timon & Pumbaa are unamusing and wasted, but at the same time are unnecessarily forced into this prequel/sequel.\r\n\r\nObviously, this still falls far adrift of the beloved original animated film. Nevertheless, I'll hold it in higher esteem than the 2019 remake, even if I didn't overly mind that one to be fair. Oh, lastly, nice touch dedicating this to James Earl Jones at the get-go - was expecting it at the end.",

Luckily, he is rescued by the friendly young cub \"Taka\" whose mother \"Eshe\" convinces his sceptical father \"Obasi\" to let her adopt him. The pair prove inseparable as they grow up, but the encroachment of a pride of angry white lions led by \"Kiros\" soon threatens their peaceful lives and forces the two to flee in search of a mystical land.

Not that jeopardy is in anyway the point here, it's not that kind of Disney film. It's really just a fairly shameless rip-off of the first, far superior, film that though it looks great with all the integrated live-action visuals has a story that's cheesily wafer thin. It's purpose is to set out the origins of the \"Lion King\" (1994) but all it really does is remind us of just how good that was and just how average this one is. They keep referring to the \"Circle of Life\" but barring a few meanderings from the orchestral score into the songs from the past, we are simply left with some banal offerings from Lin-Manuel Miranda best summed up by \"Bye Bye\" - straight from the Janet and John book of rhyming \"seas\" with \"trees\". Certainly, it looks great but it's also quite confusing whom it's for. The kids watching in the cinema with me were quickly bored by the undercooked story once the awe of the visuals had worn off. It's all perfectly watchable and is quite a testament to the arts of those in the CGI department well worthy of the big screen, but it's all instantly forgettable fayre that just sort of rolls along towards it's rousing denouement unremarkably.",

  "content": "**A long form review originally posted in 2010:**\r\n\r\nI find, the best way to look at this movie, is as two movies. Sounds strange I know, but bear with me.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand you have this Super Hero movie, it's about the main character, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), flying around doing comic book-character type stuff, and it's this pretty okay action film that's worth taking a look at. Then, there's this drama with a hint of comedy, this other film isn't really a genre, it's just about the characters interacting with each other, it's about the main character, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), driving around doing billionaire-playboy type stuff, and this movie, is fucking great. Part script, and part flawless acting, this movie sets _Iron Man 2_ apart from any other Super Hero film out there. It was explored in the first film, and you get a similar thing there, but in this movie the division is more clear, and it bizarrely benefits from it.\r\n\r\nWhen films go franchise-style, it's inevitable that there will be scheduling conflicts, it's an unfortunate part of the industry, particularly when you have a deadline to meet, and for whatever reason, an actor will be unable to return to their original role. Such an event takes place in _Iron Man 2_ when Lt. Col. James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes (originally played by Terrance Howard) is replaced by Don Cheadle. I personally think that Howard was better suited to the role, simply because he looks more like Rhodey does in the comics. But their way of dealing with the changeover is simple, and clever, the character's first lines, whilst making perfect sense in context, are \"Look, it's me, I'm here, deal with it. Let's move on. Drop it.\" Very classy.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mickey Rourke (_Get Carter, Sin City, The Wrestler, Man on Fire, The Expendables_) manages a very convincing evil Russian; Ivan Vanko, who's a perfectly good character, Whiplash as a villain is unfortunately somewhat lacking. Sam Rockwell (_The Green Mile, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Frost/Nixon, Moon, Conviction_) plays Justin Hammer, corporate rival of Stark's. Scarlett Johansen (_Eight Legged Freaks, The Girl with a Pearl Earring, The Island, The Prestige, The Spirit_) is another good addition to the cast, in the role of Natalie Rushman A.K.A Natasha Romanoff A.K.A Black Widow. Samuel L. Jackson (_Jurassic Park, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, The Starwars Prequel Trilogy, Shaft, S.W.A.T, Kill Bill Volume 2, Snakes on a Plane, 1408, The Spirit, Inglourious Basterds_) portraying S.H.I.E.L.D Director Nick Fury, rounds out the newbies in the cast. And it's all good news.\r\n\r\nThe Hammerdrones are an attempt at revamping the whole boss-battle that was such a let down in the original film, which honestly, once again didn't really work out. Once again it's a case of the character interaction that makes the film what it is. The effects also went a long way in the line of helping out the film, 'cause they were awesome. There are a couple of negatives in the script, just those moments when the suspension of disbelief is not... suspend-y enough. As for example the line; \"Congratulations sir, you have created a new element\", is a little flawed.\r\n\r\nThough if I was forced to choose between them, I would probably say that _Iron Man_ is the better of the two films, but _Iron Man 2_ has a better re-watch value in my opinion, which I prize highly. I wait with baited breath for the next Marvel film to come out, _Thor_.\r\n\r\n63%\r\n\r\n-Gimly",

  "content": "**A predictable sequel that continues the story of the first film without, however, being as good as it is.**\r\n\r\nAfter an excellent first movie, this was a predictable sequel, but I have to admit that the movie is a bit over the top and that, sometimes, it feels like a very expensive video game. Furthermore, the main character, Tony Stark, is perhaps one of the nastiest and most irritating comic heroes, and this movie seems to try to accentuate that by turning the protagonist into a spoiled playboy who has expensive toys and looks at women like if they were, also, toys. Okay, I know the character was also portrayed like that in the original books, even though I'm not a comics fan. But the movie could give something that made Tony Stark someone we could really care about.\r\n\r\nIn this film, the hero will face his first great antagonist, the son of a Soviet scientist that Stark's father knew. At the same time, Stark has to face the US Army, who are eager to get their hands on the combat suits he created, discovering that his father knew of a new chemical element, not yet officially discovered, and in which lies the key for the survival of Stark himself. With these brief lines, we can see, right away, that the script is not exactly one of the strong points of the film. The feeling that remains is that the script shoots in several directions, trying to create a more complex story, but that something got in the way and prevented that objective.\r\n\r\nThe cast basically has the same names as the previous film. Robert Downey Jr. is back to the red armor for yet another film, where he has shown himself to be deftly sarcastic and irritating without losing his heroic pose. Mickey Rourke is a welcome addition to the cast, playing the villain. The actor was able to adapt to the character quite competently. Samuel L. Jackson, Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle also return, but they don't do more than they did in the previous film, still fulfilling what was asked of them. Scarlett Johansson deserves a praise for her work here, but the rest of the cast just do what needs to be done.\r\n\r\nThe film is yet another very expensive blockbuster, abundantly financed by Marvel, and it is very obvious that it will become one of the most watched films of the season. With so much money and financial interest involved, the film was doomed to a loud and flashy bet on high-quality, but still obviously false, effects and CGI. The film has a lot of action and the fights are excellent, although obviously choreographed and stilted. The cinematography is crisp, vibrant, and magnificently beautiful. The film bets a lot on quality props, good sets and costumes, as well as a good soundtrack.",

Armed with some pretty impressive laser whips, he is out to avenge his poor dead dad. Meantime, business rival \"Hammer\" (Sam Rockwell) sees an opportunity to capitalise on this by offering the government a drone army that could do the peace in our time bit, but of course he has a megalomanic ulterior motive... Though the film looks good, and there are plenty of action scenes with pyrotechnics and airborne antics, the scenarios recycle themselves once to often. There is no jeopardy, and both Rockwell and Rourke really just substitute excessive ham for menace. Most of the originality and humour of the first film has been lost, indeed this is just a bit relentless and actually quite dull. Perhaps because so many of the other MCU characters are more interesting than this one? I don't know, but though I enjoyed it on the big screen, I was actually quite bored by it all.",

This entry is another drastic step up from the previous film and the tone takes a dramatic shift in terms of seriousness.\r\n\r\nThe quality and cinematography are simply brilliant in this film. There are so many amazing shots and sequences that just had me completely enamored. These films are ahead of their time for sure.\r\n\r\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban has the best plot of the series so far. There is a constant threat looming in the background throughout the entire film that is known from the opening minutes. Sirius Black's menacing posters and headlines create a real sense of danger, and he truly seems mad. The dementors also deliver a serious threat on screen. Their introduction is terrifying, and their presence is felt in every scene.\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite things about this film is the conclusion, the time traveling elements are perfect and answer so many questions that I had when running through the finale the first time. My fiancé and I were very confused at how things were happening, and I was having a hard time believing it. But it was brilliant the way it looped around, and the audience was given more background information that made those scenes complete.\r\n\r\nThe trio of Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint elevate their performances once again. Their chemistry is amazing, and I have a feeling this complement will be handed out during every film until the conclusion. Gary Oldman was fantastic as Sirius Black and one of the more compelling \"villains\" of the series so far. Michael Gambon does an excellent job filling in for the late Richard Harris, it was really difficult to even tell that it was a different actor.\r\n\r\nMy only complaint about this film was the beginning of the movie was slightly rushed. I felt like from when Harry left the Dursley's to when he arrived at Hogwarts the audience was whipped around from location to location, and it was hard to keep track of why. But the plot settles in and finds it's groove after that and delivers a near perfect conclusion.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _87%_ |\r\n**Verdict:** _Excellent_",

  "content": "He's experienced about as much pain and suffering as anyone I've encountered, give or take, and he still has Hell to look forward to. \r\n \r\n\"Warning: Spoilers\"\r\n \r\nSeven is directed by David Fincher and written by Andrew Kevin Walker. It stars Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey and R. Lee Ermey. Music is scored by Howard Shore and cinematography by Darius Khondji.\r\n\r\nAn unnamed US city and two cops are on the trail of a serial killer who kills his victims according to which one of the seven deadly sins they have committed.\r\n\r\nHaving been stung by the studio interference and negative fall out regarding his directorial debut feature film, Alien 3, David Fincher waited three years before committing to a project that he had control over. The result was Seven, a dark masterpiece of unremitting creeping dread that showcased the work of a clinically excellent director. Seven is not just a movie, it's an experience, an assault on the senses, a jolt to the brain, a trawl through the dark recess of some sick city where it always rains and the darkness holds many fears. This is no boorish slasher movie, it's psychological discord 101, we only see the aftermath of crimes, the discussions of which forces us to delve deep into our own imagination to fill in the blanks, forcing us to go where we don't want to go, you sense the director is somewhere gleefully pulling our strings.\r\n\r\n\"But that's the point. We see a deadly sin on every street corner, in every home, and we tolerate it. We tolerate it because it's common, it's trivial. We tolerate it morning, noon, and night. Well, not anymore. I'm setting the example. What I've done is going to be puzzled over and studied and followed... forever\"\r\n\r\nSeven is very much an ultimate horror film, really is there anything more scary than a serial killer who is smarter than the cops chasing him? Not only that but they are, oblivious as they be, part of the master plan. This killer is not only unstoppable in perpetrating his violent crimes, he is, as Freeman's weary retirement bound Detective Somerset says, methodical and patient. It's going to end bad, the cops know it and so do we, and that's when Fincher and Walker stick their hands into our guts and pull out the last semblance of solids to deliver one of the greatest endings of modern cinema. An ending fit to grace any noir, neo-noir or smart ass psychological horror movie from across the ages. With each viewing of Seven there's the repeating wave of bleak emotions that come as the reversed end credits roll, desolation and disbelief, sadness and shock, our trip through earthly hell is over, but only in the psychical sense!\r\n\r\nFaultless cast performances, no doubt eked out by what we now know is a task-master director, photography that brilliantly brings to \"light\" the melancholic sheen of a decaying society and a Howard Shore score that crawls out of the speakers and cloaks your body like some evil Incubus or Succubus. Seven, a masterpiece of unease and evil wrung out by a master director. 10/10",

  "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nI've never written or even thought about my favorite movies of all-time. I don't believe in having a definite Top10 or Top20 of every film I've ever seen. However, if I had to write this special list, I have no doubts that Se7en would be there. Obviously, this is a rewatch of the classic movie that impacted filmmaking and launched David Fincher's remarkable career (I also ignore the fact that Alien 3 is connected to Fincher due to the known production issues). With his next film, Mank, coming up on Netflix in a few weeks, I decided to go through part of his filmography. Se7en will be the first out of five Fincher's movies that I will be able to revisit throughout this week.\r\n\r\nI've seen this film countless times, but to be completely honest, I haven't seen it in so long that I didn't remember exactly some important plot points and a key component about the ending. This helped me experience Se7en in a fascinating way once again. Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay has one of the most intriguing, mysterious, captivating narratives I've ever witnessed, still to this day. From the very beginning to the last second, I'm constantly at the edge of my seat (in this case, my couch) with severe anxiety levels and feeling incredibly tense. Biting my nails, moving my leg up and down, changing positions… it's so mesmerizing that I'm only writing about it more than twenty-four hours after I watched it.\r\n\r\nOne of the most impressive aspects is how Fincher is able to leave the viewer uncomfortable with showing only a single death on-screen. This is an extremely dark, gory, blood-soaked, gruesome flick, packed with horrible displays of dead bodies, but never the actual murder scene. With just a simple photo or a straight line of dialogue, Fincher lets the viewer's imagination do the work, and it's undoubtedly as or more effective than a visually horrific killing sequence. As the premise implies, the serial killer is inspired by the \"seven deadly sins\", and he goes after the respective sinners, killing them (or letting them kill themselves) in an innovative fashion, turning the sin against the sinner.\r\n\r\nThe gluttony and sloth cases are visually brutal, but the lust murder is the one that keeps haunting my memory. The latter is also the less explicit, left to open-minded people to imagine the despicable act. In 1995, a movie with such a dismal environment and dark story couldn't be well-received, and Se7en got its fair share of negative reviews stating that it was too obscure, sinister, overly violent and that the ending was absolutely unacceptable. Over time, it found its success, it gained fans all around the world, and it's now considered by many as one of the greatest films ever made, myself included. From the outstanding cast to the astonishingly enthralling detective work, the third act stands out as one of the most shocking endings of all-time.\r\n\r\nI'm keeping this review spoiler-free because I don't want readers who have not seen this movie to have such a magnificent piece of cinema ruined for them. That's why I'm also hiding a certain actor from the starring section, just like the marketing team did at the original date of release (I'll get there). Fincher's third act is simply flawless. Everything displayed on-screen in the last twenty minutes is filmmaking perfection. From the impressively suspenseful build-up to that jaw-dropping climactic moment, passing through a mind-blowing revelation, Se7en's conclusion is and will remain as one of the most brutally shocking endings in the history of cinema.\r\n\r\nMorgan Freeman and Brad Pitt share fantastic chemistry, portraying two iconic characters that couldn't be more different than one another. Somerset is a notable detective with extreme attention to detail, knowledgeable, and always curious about the case at hand. Freeman incorporates this character effortlessly, delivering a subtle yet powerful performance. Pitt portrays Mills, a childish, unfocused, immature replacement to the previous detective about to retire. Despite its apparent lack of work ethics, Mills is clever, relentless in finding the killer, and desperately wants to prove himself. Pitt, just like Freeman, embodies this persona seamlessly and also gives an outstanding interpretation.\r\n\r\nTechnically, where should I begin? From the haunting score of Howard Shore to the documentary-like cinematography (Darius Khondji) that offers a tremendously realistic atmosphere, it's the phenomenal production design that stands out. Fincher really wanted the dirty, rainy, depressing city to feel authentic and as real as possible. The first dialogues of the film are meant to point out the bleakness and awfulness of the city, but even without these conversations, any viewer will be able to acknowledge the absence of color, joyfulness, and life in this unknown location. Fincher's filmmaking techniques are demonstrated in plain splendor for everyone to see, and this was just his beginning.\r\n\r\nMovies like Se7en are impossible to be made today, period. It would never be conceivable to completely hide one of the main actors from the press tour and/or trailers. We live in a time where the promotion of a film must have everything and everyone. Nowadays, trailers show way too much, and this isn't news to anyone. The ending was forced by Pitt and Fincher since the studio wanted a more mainstream conclusion. Today, filmmakers may have more freedom, but there are still countless cases of executive producers changing a movie without the director's will and/or permission. Se7en was a film released in a time where it should have never been released in the first place. Fortunately, it was.\r\n\r\nSe7en might be the best director's sophomore movie in the history of cinema, and it's undoubtedly one of my favorite films of all-time. David Fincher's classic possesses one of the most captivating screenplays I've ever witnessed, marked by an extremely dark, somber, violent, gruesome story that ends with one of the most emotionally shocking conclusions to a movie, ever. The lack of on-screen death scenes is both the most surprising and effectively powerful element of the whole film, leaving the unpleasant work of imagining a specific type of murder to the viewer's mind. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are extraordinary as the now iconic detectives, delivering two truly brilliant performances. Fincher's trademark filmmaking style started here, as every technical aspect contributes to the movie's incredible realism. From the simple, documentary-like camera work to the ominous score, it's the authentic production design that sets the depressing tone, the bleak atmosphere, and the rainy, colorless, lifeless city. Overall, it's a technically flawless piece of art. One of the greatest films ever made…. I can't recommend it more.\r\n\r\nRating: A+",

A man has been force-fed beans until he, quite literally, burst! A missing slither of kitchen floor lino suggests the fridge had recently been moved and behind that they find a clue - one that suggests this man had committed one of the deadly sins (gluttony) and therefore it's reasonable to assume that six more, equally heinous, killings may follow. Indeed when they start to doc just that, both detectives must hastily learn to work together - despite their contrasting approaches to police work - if they are to piece together the evidence. What makes matters worse for the pair, is that they begin to suspect that they are the metaphorical ball of wool for the killer's cat. They get closer and closer, but are always just that little bit late as this self-appointed weapon of god seems to be being wielded with every more horrific killing. David Fincher allows both actors here to develop this mystery compellingly, with a sparing but potent dialogue and an almost perfectly paced and scored progress as we all know what must come last - but never will we anticipate just how the coup de gras will be delivered. This is one of these superior crime dramas that leaves a little more to think about each time I watch it. Really good.",

  "content": "Seven is an atmospheric thriller that expertly dives into the darker corners of human nature while keeping you on edge with its gripping narrative. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt lead with contrasting yet complementary performances, Freeman as the world-weary detective and Pitt as the impulsive rookie. Their chemistry adds depth to the story, grounding it in realism even as the plot explores the grotesque. The pacing is deliberate, letting the tension simmer before delivering gut-punch moments that linger long after the credits roll.\r\n\r\nThe film’s visual tone is a masterpiece in itself, with its dreary, rain-soaked cityscape enhancing the oppressive mood. David Fincher’s direction is meticulous, drawing you into every scene with his use of lighting, shadows, and a haunting score. Kevin Spacey’s restrained yet chilling presence elevates the third act, leaving you questioning morality and justice in ways most films wouldn’t dare. Every detail feels purposeful, from the unsettling crime scenes to the nuanced character development.\r\n\r\nIf you’re a fan of dark, thought-provoking thrillers, Seven is a must-watch. It’s not just a story about a hunt for a serial killer; it’s an exploration of humanity’s flaws and the consequences of obsession.",

  "content": "Sometimes the simplest yet most profound messages we can receive come from the unlikeliest of sources. So it is with the second animated feature from writer-director Gints Zilbalodis, a stunningly beautiful, inspiringly insightful odyssey about a band of animals seeking to find their way and survive in a new world. When a great flood essentially destroys the world of man, a wide-eyed black cat must figure out how to get by when this consuming deluge wipes out the existence he has known, armed with only his own wits and the cooperation of fellow animal kindreds, including a capybara, a meerkat, a secretary bird and a pack of dogs, most notably a yellow Labrador retriever. Together this band of different creatures navigates the waters of this new world in an abandoned sailboat, learning how to work together to support one another and to stay alive, surmounting an array of challenges along the way. In the process, they collectively learn valuable life lessons that we as humans can all stand to follow, especially when confronted with circumstances not unlike those that we all must contend with in a world on the edge, conditions to which most of us can probably relate these days. The answers that these creatures come up with are often patently obvious, but the film thoughtfully prompts us to ask ourselves that, if these simple solutions are so readily apparent, why aren’t we doing more ourselves to embrace them in addressing our own current challenges? That’s a very good question and one of the greatest strengths of this widely acclaimed release. This dialogue-free offering, whose only sounds come from the authentic utterances of its animal protagonists and its emotive background score, features exquisite animation in its depiction of a world in transition, one showing the remnants of what’s been left behind and the emergence of what’s coming into being. While the narrative takes a little time to initially find its footing and is occasionally episodic as it unfolds, the various incidents it portrays as the story plays out are instructive, touching, meaningful and spot on in conveying the picture’s myriad insights, crafted in a way that shows more than tells and successfully avoids the temptation to spoon-feed audiences. “Flow” may be animated, but it’s by no means a cartoon, an accomplishment to which more films in this genre should attempt to aspire. This Golden Globe Award winner and Oscar nominee for best animated feature is a true gem, one from which we could all stand to learn a lot – and, one would hope, before we’re faced with circumstances like these ourselves.",

There is no sign of any human being anywhere, but a small boat floats by manned by a coypu. The cat hops aboard and after an initial spat, the host settles back to sleep and they continue to drift aimlessly along what appear to be brand new waterways, meeting an host of fellow creatures along the way. Some appear friendly, others less so with many of them dispossessed of their usual habitats and others rather thriving in their new aquatic environment. Initials suspicions and reticence starts to morph into something more friendly and the animals convey a message that better together might be their route to survival. Sometimes those choices cause conflict, or require leaps of faith and that is the message that is delivered quite effectively as their amiable escapades unfold. I didn’t find the animation that spectacular, but when married together with some intricately designed audio we are presented with a charming and quite potent tale of what makes them and, vicariously, us tick amidst a changing and beautifully imagined forest that also elicits an appreciation of a sense of change, vivacity, collaboration and of nature. It’s simply told, celebratory and enjoyable to watch.",

  "content": "Director Gints Zilbalodis has created a visionary work of art with “Flow,” an absolutely jaw-dropping, stunning animated film that takes viewers on a breathtaking journey through both the natural and mystical realms. Following a courageous cat and an unlikely band of animal companions as they navigate a flooded, post-apocalyptic world, the film is an emotionally charged, visually immersive film that combines high stakes, environmental themes, and an unforgettable sense of adventure.\r\n\r\nThis is a film that completely drew me in from the very first frame, and not just with its beautiful animation, but with its deep, resonant story about survival, cooperation, and the fragility of our planet. This is one of the best films of the year, and it’s unlike anything I have ever seen before.\r\n\r\nThe story centers around a little black cat whose home is devastated by a catastrophic flood. Forced to flee after a devastating event (there are no humans to be found and only traces of them remain), he eventually finds refuge on an abandoned boat. The cat teams up with a menagerie of other animals, including a capybara, a lemur, a bird, and a dog, all of whom have been displaced from their homes. Relying on trust, courage, and their collective wits to survive the increasingly dangerous environment, the animals must now work together to navigate the perilous waters in search of dry land.\r\n\r\nWhat sets this story apart from other animated films is its compelling and unique approach to animal behavior. While the animals display primal instincts, the film also incorporates a fantasy element where they seem to take on more human-like qualities (thankfully none talk, and no words are spoken in the entire film).\r\n\r\nZilbalodis and his team focus on a more nuanced, naturalistic portrayal of these animals rather than having the characters engage in zany antics or delivering silly punchlines. There are subtle hints, like exploring the solitary nature of the cat while watching as he slowly learns the benefits of cooperating with others. One of the more interesting aspects of the story is when the animals form mini societies on their floating vessels, giving the film an intriguing balance between realism and imagination. Even through non-verbal communication, the interactions between the characters feel authentic, especially as their survival instincts kick in. This is incredibly thoughtful and sophisticated storytelling.\r\n\r\nThe visual style is breathtaking, as the film is set in a lush, flooded world. Everything feels so meticulously crafted in a way that evokes the haunting beauty and disquieting peril of a newly aquatic landscape. Just when you think the film can’t look any more spectacular, yet another scene comes along that’s even more stunning than the last. This is one for lovers of the art form of cinema.\r\n\r\nThe floodwaters that have taken over the planet become a character in their own right, creating an atmosphere of constant tension and uncertainty. Everything about this film kept me on the edge of my seat. This is a story of survival, and the animals struggle. This isn’t a story that’s all wrapped up in a neat little bow, and the environmental themes are a substantial, poignant meditation on climate change and the destruction of our planet’s ecosystems.\r\n\r\nZilbalodis wisely avoids making things too bleak or heavy-handed and finds moments of hope and warmth through the animals’ shared journey. There’s a beautiful message about cooperation and the power of friendship, especially in the face of insurmountable odds, that provides a constant (if faint) feeling of much appreciated optimism.\r\n\r\nAt its heart, “Flow” is a film about survival, trust, and community. Its narrative may be simple, but it’s filled with profound emotional depth. Whether you’re an animal lover or someone who enjoys a thoughtful ecological tale, this film offers something for everyone. It’s a beautifully crafted adventure that doesn’t shy away from difficult topics, but it also fills you with a sense of wonder and possibility.\r\n\r\nBy combining impressive visuals, heartfelt storytelling, and a powerful environmental message, “Flow” is as enchanting as it is thought-provoking. I was deeply moved by the film’s themes and captivated by not only the beauty of the animation, but also its overall spirit.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

  "content": "I suppose if you are called “Zephyr” then you’re likely to be a bit of a free spirit, so when we meet this one (Hassie Harrison) we ought not to be surprised that she does pretty much what she likes when she likes. That includes having a one night stand with the rather drippy but fit-looking realtor “Moses” (Josh Heuston) before she absconds before pancakes to ride the waves. Thing is, she’s got no fin key so has to borrow one from the friendly “Tucker” (Jai Courtney) whom we already know is a bit of a wrong ‘un. Next thing, she awakens tied to a bed on a boat next to “Heather” (Ella Newton) with both ready to star in the ultimate in horror flicks sustained only by Vegemite sandwiches (on stodgy white bread, too!). With him holding all the cards, things don’t look  too good for these two women but luckily “Zephyr” is a gutsy and resourceful young woman and meantime the hapless and pining “Moses” is concerned that she has gone missing-in-action and is trying to find out where she’s gone. Can fate be thwarted? Can he track down his chum in time? Hmmm. Well, sadly there just isn’t anything about this that leaves any doubt about the conclusion, and the episodic, start/stop/start again nature of the storytelling just strings us along with a series of implausible scenarios that pad it out with all the certainty of the undoubted denouement. Aided by some impressive underwater photography, this could have been quite a fun half hour if Sean Byrne had had the courage of his original convictions and just let the initial impetus do the work, but once the thing starts to repeat itself it just becomes a bit preposterous as serendipity takes just too great and frequent a role.

  "content": "The sci-fi drama The Life of Chuck is based on a Stephen King short novella of the same name, which is included in the 2020 story collection called If It Bleeds. The screenplay and film are written and directed by Mike Flanagan (Gerald’s Game, Doctor Sleep). The film is broken down into three acts told in reverse chronological order. Despite being based on a Stephen King story, this is not a horror film and is drama more in line with films like The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile.\r\n\r\nIn the not-too-distant future, the world is crumbling. The internet is down for good, California has dissolved into the sea, cell phones have stopped working altogether, massive sinkholes cause impossible traffic nightmares, and stars begin disappearing out of the night sky.\r\n\r\nThe one constant is that a man named Charles Krantz (Tom Hiddleston) is being thanked nonstop through bizarre marketing like billboard, radio, and TV ads, skywriting, and graffiti. And yet nobody seems to know him.\r\n\r\nThe Life of Chuck’s backward storytelling gives Charles Krantz a kind of Benjamin Button aura but is somehow less interesting. The acts follow Chuck through different ages or stages in his life; as a young boy (Benjamin Pajak), as a teenager (Jacob Tremblay), and as an adult (Hiddleston). The story is immaculate when it comes to explaining why Chuck has a fascination with dancing, his association with math and how he ended up as an accountant, and what his grandfather Albie Krantz (Mark Hamill) was hiding in the locked cupola that would become Chuck’s childhood home.\r\n\r\nHowever, The Life of Chuck leaves out important information. Mike Flanagan’s screenplay seems mostly accurate to Stephen King’s original story, but nothing is explained regarding the state of the world in the future or why there are Charles Krantz advertisements everywhere. What resides in the cupola is interesting, but it also just raises more questions with the only takeaway being that we should continue to live our lives without worrying about what lies ahead.\r\n\r\nThe acts all have important life moments for Chuck. Act Three sees Chuck’s journey ending at the same time the world is ending. His grandfather dies in Act Two while he’s a teenager. Chuck finally has the opportunity to see what’s inside the cupola. In act one, Chuck loses his parents at a young ages and lives with his grandparents throughout childhood. He finds comfort in dancing and eventually discovers the love of his life.\r\n\r\nDespite getting top billing, Tom Hiddleston gets maybe ten minutes of screen time, and most of that time is spent dancing in the street. He also doesn’t have many lines of dialogue. There’s a reason for that, but if you’re a Hiddleston fan seeing this hoping for a meaty role then you’ll be sorely disappointed.\r\n\r\nThe majority of Act Three is driven by people walking around and talking. News reports and TV broadcast signals are being cut short, but most exciting aspects aren’t shown and take place off-screen. Act 3 mostly follows a teacher named Marty Anderson (Chiwetel Ejiofor) as he attempts to maneuver a world falling to pieces while trying to get to his ex-wife Felicia Gordon (Karen Gillan).\r\n\r\nConversations and particularly our interactions with people are what shape The Life of Chuck. What the littlest thing in the present like a grandmother dancing to rock and roll in the kitchen while she cooks and what that could mean throughout the rest of our lives makes Chuck feel more and more like a genuine person as he ages and experiences more as his life progresses.\r\n\r\nDespite being a relatively normal guy, Charles Krantz’s life was given extraordinary treatment and the spotlight. And maybe that’s the big takeaway from the film and the story that no matter how routine our life feels there are still wonderful moments and unforgettable life lessons that more than just one person experiences.\r\n\r\nThe film features Mark Hamill giving a five-minute speech about how great math is to a young Chuck culminating with a line that would stick with anyone for the rest of their life; math is an art and you have art in you. The craft and beauty have never been the big predictable moments we all see coming, but what we do in between and how we get there.\r\n\r\nWholesome, meaningful, timely, and incredibly moving; The Life of Chuck is overflowing with heart and is the type of film we all need right now. Our lives are a gift that deserves to be lived and studied and reminded of how incredible it is to exist.",

  "content": "It’s incredibly frustrating to watch a film that has so much potential but ultimately fails to capitalize on it. Such is the case with one of the most heavily anticipated offerings of the summer movie season, “The Life of Chuck, from writer-director Mike Flanagan, based on the short story of the same name from author Steven King. Told in three acts in reverse chronological order, the picture follows the life of Charles “Chuck” Krantz (Tom Hiddleston) and how his adult self emerged from a childhood of mixed experiences under the care of his paternal grandparents (Mark Hamill, Mia Sara). It focuses on how an inquisitive preteen (Jacob Tremblay) with a love of and gift for dance ultimately (and largely inexplicably) settled for a mediocre life as an accountant instead, one whose existence was sadly cut short in his prime and subsequently provided the basis for soul-searching and introspective reflection among characters and audience members alike. In telling this story, the film seeks to address a variety of grand philosophical and cosmological questions, many of which are tied to regrets about the compromises we make during our lifetimes. While the film certainly has its share of genuine flashes of brilliance in this regard, there aren’t nearly enough of them, and those that manage to surface are frequently underdeveloped, soft peddled, applied inconsistently (even in contradictory fashion) or significantly watered down. It’s almost as if the filmmaker lacked sufficient confidence in his own message, yielding a superficial, uneven, sometimes treacly treatment of its foundational principles. The fault here primarily lies with a script that should have gone through one or more additional rounds of revisions to refine what it was attempting to achieve – its quest to make the truly profound statement it was striving for instead of settling for something far less sublime and eminently unsatisfying. Moreover, the screenplay’s shortcomings carry over into other aspects of the production, particularly the unnecessary inclusion of extraneous material while simultaneously undercooking other more relevant elements. And this, in turn, affects such other aspects as the film’s underwhelming editing and sometimes-unimpressive performances (most notably Hiddleston, who ends up primarily playing a glorified walk-on). To its credit, there are some noteworthy attributes, such as the positively mesmerizing opening sequence (as presented here, “Act Three”), the picture’s delightful sense of whimsy, clever (if occasionally overdone) homages to other pictures (especially “Back to the Future” (1985) and “The Truman Show” (1998)), an excellent original score and commendable complementary soundtrack (despite its mind-boggling exclusion of what would have been a perfectly suited addition, one that Tom Petty fans will readily recognize), and a fine supporting performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor. But, these assets aside, they’re not enough to make up for the picture’s shortfalls. To that end, then, moviegoers looking for better screening choices that address material like what was intended here would be wise to view Tim Burton’s far superior “Big Fish” (2003) instead. Indeed, had it been handled more adeptly, “The Life of Chuck” could have been one of the best-ever adaptations of one of King’s works and one of the best overall releases of recent years, a picture with much to offer audiences on so many fronts. Unfortunately, we’ll never get to see that film and the valuable wisdom it could have imparted for how we live our lives and how we can get the most out of them while we have the chance.",

In the way of them achieving their goal is the British Governor's daughter, the son of Bootstrap Turner, oh and a former comrade by the name of Captain Jack Sparrow who the crew had left to die on an island some time ago.\r\n\r\nIt's now common knowledge that Pirates Of The Caribbean is a film based upon a theme park ride of the same name, thoughg that ride is not actually a roller-coaster, it's fair to say that this film most assuredly is. A swashbuckling ripper of an adventure yarn cramming in every pirate film staple it can and pouring on layers of charm at every turn. Into the broth goes romance, comedy and striking adventure, and director Gore Verbinski even manages to give the children watching little slices of horror, not enough to keep them up at night, but enough to bring on an uneasy grin.\r\n\r\nIt's unashamedly commercial, produced by that purveyor of OTT entertainment values, Jerry Bruckheimer, it was to be expected, but few blockbusting movies of the new age can lay claim to being such an out and out reason for having fun. This is the reason why Pirates had few peers at the time of its release, for it knows its reason for being, it's not taking itself seriously. The audience is not being hoodwinked in any way, they are having fun because so is the film and so is, crucially, the impressive cast. Johnny Depp as Sparrow is having the time of his life, basing the character around the dubious mannerisms of Rolling Stone icon, Keith Richards, it works to its highest potential and Depp is simply wonderful in the role. Keira Knightley (perfectly cast), Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, Jack Davenport, Jonathan Pryce and Mackenzie Crook all do what was asked, which is essentially say your lines right and have a blast with it, it really is that sort of picture.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent sequels would forget what made this first offering so enjoyable, foregoing the outrageous sense of fun for a dark sheen and character development. That is a shame, but at the very least we still have this wonderful picture to go back to time and time again, to lift you up when one is down or to keep one happy when one is already in that happy place. The Curse Of The Black Pearl is a joy from start to finish. 9/10",

He turns up just as the governor's daughter \"Elizabeth\" (Keira Knightley) is having to fend off the rather unwanted matrimonial intentions of \"Norrington\" (Jack Davenport). She has designs on the blacksmith's apprentice - \"Turner\" (a handsome but insipid, sorry, Orlando Bloom) whom she rescued from a pirate raid many years earlier. \"Sparrow\" would prove an excellent catch for \"Norrington\" but thanks to an hot poker, a donkey and some legerdemain at sea, he and \"Turner\" are soon abroad on the trail of his old crew and of the legendary pirates who sail the seas in the \"Black Pearl\" seeking an odd sort of salvation! What now ensues are some pacily directed escapades with loads of attitude, swash and buckle. Some pithy dialogue and a rousing (if slightly repetitive) score from Klaus Badelt take us criss-crossing the Caribbean constantly jumping from frying pan to fire. The star for me here is certainly Geoffrey Rush. A man who rarely disappoints, and on this occasion brings a comically potent degree of menace as his \"Barbossa\" character ensures that the plot thickens and the story gathers momentum. It's a bit on the long side - there are a few sagging moments now and again, but a solid supporting cast led by Kevin McNally provide some borderline slapstick humour, occasionally tempered by the dignified persona of an underused Jonathan Pryce's \"Gov. Swann\" and an whole suite of powdered wigs. The visual effects are top drawer and the story well worth a watch on a big screen to do justice to the imagery and the best traditions of seafaring yarns.",

I have liked enough of them to make me willing to try them, but it is the exception for me to enjoy them, not the rule. So a fair action thriller is less likely to hold my attention than, say, a fair western or sci-if movie.\r\n\r\nAll that is just to say as a preamble that this movie held my attention and interest, which was all it needed to do. I gave it a try because I like Bob Odenkirk, though I must say I don’t see him as an action hero.\r\n\r\nNeither the story nor the characters were particular gripping for me, but as I said, it was entertaining enough for me to stick with it, despite the excess of deaths. I am not complying about the violence,I  should clarify, just the body count. It is almost like the director came out before every scene, clapped his hands, and instead of saying “Here is what I want from each of you,” he asked “Here is how many dead bodies I want.” It is almost cartoonish. Violence can be powerful and sizzle in the viewer’s gut, but when there is way too much of it, it loses its power and even its relevance.\r\n\r\nSo although I have no idea if the average action thriller crowd liked this movie, I will say that if you are not a fan of violence, action films or Bob Odenkirk, I would give it a miss.",

I'm not expecting high art or even anything particularly special from a standard \"dude goes on a rampage\" narrative but for a film that started off having real impact from the fight scenes (unlike say John Wick who is basically Marvel level superhuman) it gives that up and turns our anti-hero into just another invisible character wrapped in so much plot armor it's hard to feel invested in the events that unfold.",

Derek Kolstad - creator of the John Wick franchise - basically writes what could easily be characterized as a spin-off of the popular action saga starring Keanu Reeves, which has its pros and cons. \r\n\r\nOn one hand, the formulaic narrative isn’t unique in the slightest, holding a cliche, weak villain, and a lack of compelling characters besides the main one. On the other hand, it features insanely gory, bloody, well-choreographed fighting sequences, where Odenkirk absolutely shines - the actor performs a shockingly impressive amount of stunts. \r\n\r\nExpectations-wise, it offers the high entertainment levels audiences crave, so I can’t help but recommend it.\r\n\r\nRating: B",

  "content": "I have to confess that I like you-f…-with-the-wrong-guy type of revenge movies so I guess it is not very surprising that I liked this movie.\r\n\r\nPeople have compared it to John Wick but I do disagree with that. Sure the basic premise of the story is quite similar but that’s it. To me these are quite different movies albeit in the same genre or even sub-genre.\r\n\r\nJohn Wick is much more classy both in John Wick’s style and the entire setting of the movie with it’s entire secret society. John Wick is also much more over the top in the action parts. Nobody is more gritty and he is slightly closer to a normal person than John Wick.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts of a bit slow actually. Well, at least in my opinion. Nobody is mostly walking around moping and looking sad. He also more or less gets beaten up right away which made me get a bit concerned as to whether this was going to be a movie I liked or not. I got really concerned when he managed to get himself tasered of all things. What the f…?\r\n\r\nLuckily he picks up on the bad-assery and it gets better as the movie progresses. Towards the end it gets really good actually, first when he frees the bad guy from the burden of all that ill gotten cash and then the showdown at the little work shop where Nobody barricaded himself together with… nah, that would be a spoiler, you have to watch the movie.\r\n\r\nThe bad guy is actually quite a good bad guy. Hollywood has been really lousy at creating good bad guys lately but this one, a real far out psychopath as well as a Russian mobster, fits the role perfectly.\r\n\r\nJust to be a bit picky, a 4.9 litre 72 Challenger? Now I may of course be wrong but to my knowledge there is no such thing as a 72 Challenger with a 4.9 litre engine (also a 4.9 litre engine is really not very impressive). Did some lazy writer just pick a number?\r\n\r\nAnyway, this was definitely a good movie. Quite enjoyable.",

  "content": "This was an unexpected pleasant surprise. I bought the blu-ray strictly because Bob Odenkirk is on the cover and as a fan of Breaking Bad (BB) and Better Call Saul, I wanted to see what this movie was about. I had no idea of what the story was, so I started watching this completely fresh. I was entertained throughout the entire film. I was surprised how believable Bob's character was throughout. The other other thing that surprised me was Mr. Odenkirk's fitness, youthfulness and the contrast of this character with the ones he plays in BB and Saul. The story was engaging but not very original. Somewhat like John Wick as I expected but it had it's own flavor of a regular guy with an unexpected past. A lot of the film required me to suspend reality and accept that what I was watching could happen knowing that it was unlikely that it would. The villains were evil and some of the scenes with the villains are over the top but fun to watch nevertheless. The movie ends with me wanting to know more about Bob's character Hutch, his comrades and what his past was both before and after he met his wife and had a family. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Bob Odenkirk and enjoys a lot of great fights and battles in a fast action movie.",

  "content": "While a group of youngsters are exploring the forest, they encounter a great well amidst the foliage. Intrigued, they ask one of their guides to regale them all with a story of elemental proportions that takes them back centuries to the very emergence of local deities in the ancient Bangra kingdom. There were two tribes who coexisted, peaceably enough, sharing the fruits of their idyllic wilderness until one strayed onto the territory of the other with tragic results. This led to a reciprocal action that soon had all the hallmarks of a conflict that will involve trading in not just the spices and coffee, but in further facilitating the Portuguese-operated slave trade supported by the violent and cowardly king “Kulshekar” (Gulshan Devalah). Despotically, he seizes on an opportunity to invade the jungle garden to destroy their village and enslave the people after their leader “Berme” (Rishab Shetty) takes control of their port and so sets up a battle of epic proportions between not just these two men, but of the powerful daiva who are now empowering both sides with some super-human powers. Given the richness of the mythology and the colourful vigour of the production, this is quite a thrilling story that showcases Shetty as a charismatic action hero with an heart of gold whilst also allowing Devalah to have some fun as the brooding megalomaniac too. Aside from a little politically charged romance with princess “Kanakavathi” (Rukmini Vasanth) it’s all grand scale, end to end, stuff that effortlessly mixes the fantastic and the mythological with loads of pyrotechnics and combat scenarios that intertwine the plentiful CGI into the action scenes to create quite a compelling and entertaining adventure movie. Yes, there are a few songs - and I don’t love those, but it’s almost three hours flew by and I enjoyed it.",

  "content": "Life as a teenager is never easy and when you are gifted with the superhuman abilities of a spider and lead a double life as a student and crime fighter; life gets even harder.\r\n\r\nMiles Morales (Shameik Moore) is finding it even harder to hide his secret from his family who has grown concerned that his erratic behavior is more than the usual teenage angst.\r\n\r\nIn another earth, Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) deals with her Police officer father desperately hunting down her alter-ego believing that she is a killer which drives a wedge between them as Gwen desperately tries to find her way forward.\r\n\r\nIn “Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse audiences learn that what one perceives as reality is often just the corner of a much larger picture and when Miles confronts what he dismisses as a “Villain of the Week” in a quirky enemy known as The Spot (Jason Schwartzman), starts a campaign against Spider-Man, he soon finds that the threat is much larger than he expected and secretly follows a visiting Gwen into an another Earth where his actions soon draw the attention of a larger temporal Spider squad.\r\n\r\nMotivated by his feelings for Gwen and a desire to do good, Miles looks to undo the damage that the Spot is causing across various Earths and learns that each one has its own version of Spider-man or Woman to protect it.\r\n\r\nAt this point the film goes into overdrive as Miles learns more about his past and how he became Spider-Man but also learns more about the cost that his powers enact on his life and those around him. There are plenty of special moments and guest appearances that follow from the more obscure to the mainstream and the range of emotions from the audience at the press screening as they reacted to the film showed they were deeply engaged and loving it.\r\n\r\nThe film does take a darker turn and does end in a cliffhanger which sets up the next film very well but also may be a bit darker than younger viewers might want. That being said; I enjoyed this film far more than I did the prior film. I found the animation style a bit off-putting as the jerky way the characters moved was a bit much over the length of a feature film. This time around there is a mix of animation styles throughout and at times in the same frame which may be a bit hard for some as the film does come at the viewer with waves of flashing lights, sounds, and animations that very cleverly mimic reading a comic complete with small boxes to define various characters from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe film runs nearly two and a half hours and did seem to go on a bit long at times but thanks to the great voice-acting and strong cast as well as engaging storyline I found myself eagerly looking forward to the next film.\r\n\r\nI first saw a rough cut of a scene at Cinemacon in 2022 and it was amazing seeing the final scene near the opening of the film as it was a rare instance of a film surpassing expectations and delivers the storyline and action with a good dose of solid characters that fans will love.\r\n\r\n4.5 stars out of 5",

  "content": "Sad night tonight. After 80-odd years, this was the last film to show in my local cinema before it closed down. Doubly sad because it’s also not actually very good. The conceptualisation behind the hybrid styles of animation is spectacular and executed in an highly polished fashion - as you’d expect. The story is all over the pace though, and the proliferation of Spidey’s seemed designed more to allow the narrative to become more culturally inclusive (and bankable) rather than to develop any meaningful characterisations. What personas there are spend their time wallowing in a mire of unrequited and/or confused familial love, or teenage angst more suitable in a soap. The dialogue has it’s moments - assuming you can catch it - and there’s a bit of humour to be found but I found the audio mix made following all that was said became a bit wearisome after a first hour that really does depend on your having watched (and remembering) the first - in my view far better - instalment. This whole “multiverse” theme can keep on recycling itself ad nauseam but if the writing remains at this unremarkable level then I’m not sure I’ll be bothering with the next set of repetitively set-piece adventures for “Miles” and his parents, love interest and fellow Spider-folk.",

Separately from enjoying this movie or not, any or all cinephiles should bow to the ridiculously talented artists and animators behind this pure work of art.\r\n\r\nThat said, the attributes and issues are more or less the same as the original. The various animation styles are overwhelmingly stunning, but also to the point of creating confusing moments. Gwen Stacy stands out from the rest of the pack – both the character and Hailee Steinfeld's voice performance – but everyone on screen is impressively captivating. The voice cast is superb all-around.\r\n\r\nAn unfinished story – remember, this is the first of two parts – about what it really means to be a hero. The 140-minute runtime isn't exactly heavy, but the necessity to resort to exposition scenes is more frequent than in the previous flick, even though the narrative complexity ends up justifying this.\r\n\r\nA must-see movie in the cinema! Go support animation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

  "content": "And perhaps _Beyond the Spider-Verse_ will retroactively make Across’ story more enjoyable, but for now, the franchise’s flashy visuals are fully in controls of its web-shooters.\r\n\r\nAs a stand alone feature, _Across the Spider-Verse_ is groundbreaking with its half-a-dozen animation styles and plethora of Spider-Men. The Spot is an insanely cool villain, Spider-Man 2099 is an anti-hero teetering on the verge of becoming a full-time villain, and Spider-Punk oozes overall awesomeness.\r\n\r\nBut with the film sitting at 162 minutes and a sequel on the way in less than a year, the story ultimately feels like it’s stretched beyond its means.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://boundingintocomics.com/2023/06/07/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-review-a-stunning-labyrinthine-benchmark-for-animation/",

  "content": "I don't know, but in my humble opinion, the punk Spider-Man really needed to look like Johnny Rotten, Sid Vicious, someone from the Sex Pistols.  He sort of screamed them in the way he was depicted, right down to the multi-media used around him.\r\n\r\nThey really missed an opportunity for if not a great pop culture reference, but at least an in-joke for the punk community.  I mean, throw us a bone here.  He spent half his time mocking us anyway (in a pretty hysterical way) at least give us the laugh when they do the face reveal.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's not bad.  Miles is less... boring in this cartoon than he is in the comics where he's developed the moniker \"Mild Morales.\"  He actually has more depth of character here and is forced to face some serious choices and turning points (Hey Marvel, you could learn a lesson here).  \r\n\r\nBut he also took a bit of a back seat to Stacey, who seemed to be the star of the show until there was an abrupt switch... which irritated me.  It sort of screamed ensemble cast, but really it just shifter from one lead to the other a bit abruptly.  As far as complaints go, that's pretty bare bones.\r\n\r\nIt also gave Spidey 2099 a sort of bad spin despite being the most beloved of the 2099 line and the coolest costume design of any spider.  So for us Gen-Xers, it sort of burned.  At least I'm old enough to have been looking forward to his inclusion only to be a little disappointed. \r\n\r\nAnd I am still very upset over how Peter is portrayed, but they are slowly redeeming his character.\r\n\r\nOver-all though, it's not bad.  It's better than just about all of the current Super-Hero movies and, honestly, it's probably the only cape franchise that people are still interested in... because it isn't totally political BS.",

  "content": "I don’t have that much to say about “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse”, the sequel to the equally terrific 2018 Oscar winning film “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,” except that it’s easily one of the best films of the year. It’s the type of achievement in animation that’s not only artistically skilled but also wildly entertaining. This is one of the most perfect pieces of animated cinema in years and even better, it’s aimed squarely at more sophisticated audiences of older kids, teens, and adults.\r\n\r\nMiles Morales (voice of Shameik Moore) is back for part two, and he’s happily fulfilling his duties as Brooklyn’s friendly neighborhood superhero. Miles finds himself joining forces with Gwen Stacy (voice of Hailee Steinfeld) and a new team of elite Spider heroes (featuring the voices of Jake Johnson, Karan Soni, Issa Rae, and others) from across the multiverse as they work together to fight off a powerful villain.\r\n\r\nThe plot is complex, but the story is terrific. The parallel universes at play don’t feel like a gimmick, and there are real stakes for every character. There are strong messages about teamwork, friendship, power, and responsibility, and it’s nice to see more female representation in a film that prides itself on diversity and inclusion. The story is a little slow at the start, but things pick up ones Miles enters the picture. His relationship with Gwen is developed extensively here, and they’re a great onscreen duo.\r\n\r\nThe film is computer-animated, and the visuals are nothing short of masterful. The animation is vibrant, skillfully executed, and absolutely stunning. This is the type of visual art that leaves your eyes begging for more. From the attention to detail to the choice of hues, there isn’t one misstep to be found.\r\n\r\nThe story, however, has a few stumbles, and most of that stems from the overly long run time (2 hours, 20 minutes), the too-insider Easter egg references for diehard comic fans, and the irritating cliffhanger ending that is so obnoxious that it almost ruins everything that came before. Thank goodness the rest of the movie is so much fun.\r\n\r\n“Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” is the type of film that proves animation isn’t just for kids, and it’s certainly not a throwaway medium that deserves to be dismissed. It’s an action-packed, visually dazzling, frentic, and outrageously fun piece of cinema. Go see it.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore",

  "content": "<em>'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse'</em> surpasses the original for me, though there's more to that statement than meets the eye. I watched the first film four years ago (almost to the day, weirdly) and remember enjoying but feeling a little nonplussed by it.\r\n\r\nI think the main reason for that is that I don't have any connection or knowledge to the comics and/or the general world of these characters, therefore last time out it was a barrage of information and characters; not much of which stuck. So it makes sense why I only mildly like it.\r\n\r\nThis time, however, I did have a fair amount of fun. I had more of an interest in the characters that carried over from the 2018 flick, while the new additions worked for me too. The story does feel more conventional than previously, which is a plus to me given the aforementioned.\r\n\r\nOther prior drawbacks were the characters of Kingpin, Green Goblin and Prowler; their designs and voices failed to hook me. Here, I did appreciate the characters away from the leads. The Spot, Hobie and Miguel are onscreen peeps that I will remember with fine fondness.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Shameik Moore and Hailee Steinfeld, I enjoyed both. Another aspect I enjoyed was the music and, of course, the animation. I actually found myself feeling kinda hyped by the ending too, which is a positive sign for <em>'Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse'</em>.",

  "content": "View it as a spin off and it's a rollicking treasure seeking adventure.\r\n\r\nOk lets have it out front right away, this particular writer loved the first film (Curse of the Black Pearl), was disappointed with the second (Dead Man's Chest) and positively found the third (At World's End) to be an incomprehensible bore. Part 4: On Stranger Tides is a shift in another direction, where a group of piratical characters, some we know well, others new to the fold, embark on missions to find the fabled Fountain of Youth. So think \"Indiana Jones\", \"National Treasures\" like adventures (hell even \"It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World\") and you get the drift here. Expectation of this franchise getting back to the heady days of that first film will be crushed pretty early on.\r\n\r\nThere's a little too much going on here for it to be safe children's fare, but the adults, especially those who remember the serial silliness of adventure films of yore, will have a good time. The action set-pieces are superb, enter high speed carriage chase through London, some spiffing sword play deep in the brewery, Blackbeard (Ian McShane) using his black magic whiles to incarcerate mutineers in a whirl of maniacal ropes, and a mermaid attack that quite frankly rocks - as do the mermaids themselves the sexy vicious teasers they are.\r\n\r\nProduction is as expected top notch, and the cast, in spite of having to battle for screen time in a cast of thousands, are doing fine work (Penélope Cruz a welcome heaving bosom of spunkiness). For sure our main man Captain Jack Sparrow, with Depp just about keeping the characters charm on tap, isn't as dominating a force as we would like, but he leaves his trusty fun mark and the others (Barbosa is back drinking rum out of his newly acquired peg leg) pick up the slack. It's unlikely to get better on revisits, so if you be hardcore POTC from earlier adventures, there's no point going back to se tis one. Those who like the type of films mentioned previously, and don't mind a different direction for the series, then tis holds no fears. 7/10",

  "content": "At least this is bit shorter than the previous edition of the franchise, but sadly it isn't really any better. Rob Marshall has taken the helm and we have lost Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley - who presumably recognised that the boat has sailed on this much weakened fantasy adventure series. This time around \"Jack\" (a rather battle-weary Johnny Depp) finds himself looking for the fountain of youth with the newly Anglicised \"Barbossa\" (Geoffrey Rush) in hot pursuit of him and of his old flame \"Angelica\" (Penélope Cruz) who happens to be none other than the the daughter of the legendary \"Blackbeard\" (Ian McShane). Now she is clever. She convinces \"Jack\" that her dad isn't so well, and that only an elixir of this water can cure him. Thing is, is \"Jack\" gullible enough to fall for this yarn? Are we? Of course it's not so simple - not only do they need to find the water, they must also find a couple of charmed chalices and, naturally, the tear of a mermaid - the latter creatures not being so benign as Walt Disney's other films might suggest. The visuals are great with a new slew of scary beasties from the depths to entertain us, but the story is pretty weak and the established characterisations struggle to resonate in anything like the way they used to. Sam Claflin adds a bit of eye candy and Richard Griffiths looks every inch the part as George II, but McShane is one of my least favourite character actors - he only has the one gear - and Miss Cruz seems more like a fish out of water than a duck taking to it. There's far too much dialogue and the denouement is stretched beyond breaking point before the obligatory \"next time\" pointer to the next instalment of this over-tired series. \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" ought to hang up it's hat now; it's had it's day.",

  "content": "I imagine most of the love for Hocus Pocus comes from people who re-watch it with nostalgia goggles. Even as a child of the 90's I had never seen Hocus Pocus and knew little of it, so I had no prior attachments to this film. If you have seen any of the Disney Channels terrible made for TV movies, Hocus Pocus is like a particularly bad one with some questionable language and sexual innuendo. The acting is really bad from the entire cast, which is a little surprising considering the witches (who I had always assumed you the heroes of the story, but are clearly not) are two D-List actresses (Bette Midler and Kathy Najimy) and a C-lister (Sarah Jessica Parker) who aren't exactly known for their acting abilities, but are actual professional actresses. The CG effects are bad, even considering this is a 1993 movie and the practical effects aren't even an honest effort. All of this could be forgiven if it was part of a fun, campy family movie, but Hocus Pocus can't even pull that off. The plot is lame and full of inconsistencies and just unreasonably unrealistic moments. The witches have been \"dead\" for 300 years, but will be brought back if a virgin lights the black flame candle. In 1990 a high school boy says multiple times publicly that he is a virgin. Let me just say that again, they think a high school boy would go around announcing himself to be a virgin repeatedly to his peers. This is a public high school in Massachusetts in the 90's, not a Mormon town or a private Catholic school. When the witches return, they have been gone for 300 years and don't even know what the paved road is, thinking it to be a river or what a bus is; they have no knowledge of any of the advances since the 1600's. Having established this, one of the witches flies up to the side of a car on their broom and asks him for his license and registration. So, they don't understand asphalt, but they know motorist jokes? The movie is littered with inconsistencies and a wild lack of understanding of how teenagers and children think and act. Even the three witches can't maintain a consistent character. Bette Midler is supposed to be the smart older sister, but she acts the most irrationally and whines like a child. Sarah Jessica Parker is a horny dumb blonde and Kathy Najimy is a mentally challenged woman who barks an talks out of the side of her mouth, but they are always the ones to reason and plan. Najimy is the worst, with her constantly swinging from offensively stupid the brains of the operation. This was an actual movie released in theaters. Had it been a cheap Disney Channel original, it would still be terrible, but excusable. As a real theatrical film, Hocus Pocus is embarrassing. Unless you grew up with this film, I can't imagine you getting much out of this. It's fairly unoffensive children's drivel, with some questionable language if that's all you need, but it's not a good film. It wasn't fun or interesting and it was probably best left in '93.",

The trio of younger actors in Omri Katz (Max), Thora Birch (Dani) and Vinessa Shaw (Allison) are OK, nothing special but passable.\r\n\r\nI didn't fully connect or like the plot itself, but it's one that suits everything else on screen well so it kinda works to be honest.

Especially that it is a 1993 Disney movie and focuses on sex, plus a lot of witch lore being based on women being sexual in a time where it was so inappropriate they would be burnt at the stake.  I digress.\r\n\r\nWhile the Sanderson sisters are a compelling premise, if sloppy, and an interesting metaphor for the desires of power, hunger, and sex, it goes to an almost cartoonish levels of ridiculous for next to no reasoning.\r\n\r\nAll the non witch cast do a fine job, and I especially liked Thora Birch's performance, I can see why she took off so well.  As for the witch cast, I have no doubt they did was in the script very well, but the script is overly ridiculous, and even just trying to relax there are jokes that make no sense and just aren't all that funny.\r\n\r\nUltimately it comes down to being a Halloween themed sub-par Babysitter's Club, or your choice of child adventure groups.",

It's got one enjoyable set-piece musical number - \"I Put a Spell on You\", of course, too. The visual effects are more Hammer than ILM, but that all just adds to the quirky, almost pantomime, entertainment value as the story heads to it's amusing denouement in the graveyard.

It is an excellent action/adventure movie for kids. Unfortunately I am not really in that viewer segment and for me this movie was pretty bad.\r\n\r\nThe movie is childish.

The visual effects and entertainment wise, the second live-action Spider-man was good too, but this one is so different. This is about a teenage superhero. Just a kid. Having possessed such superpower, how he manages it alongside his normal life was nicely told.\r\n\r\nThis story begins straight away, because the introduction was done in the previous Marvel film, which are part of Avengers universe. Peter Parker assisted by Tony Stark, is very keen to fight small crimes compared to what Avengers fighting for. He feels, he's held back by Iron Man, so he wanted to make independent decisions. At one stage he succeeds in that, but things get more severe. Fighting bad guys, and the other side of his life, a romance, how the remaining story turns out are revealed with a twist.\r\n\r\nTom Holland was good. The story was simple, more like one liner. But the visuals and each scene forged nicely. Having seen all the five previous Spider-man films, this was quite predictable. Particularly the characters and their connections. Seeing how it had ended, it is possible that the daughter of the villain could take-over her father's place. That would be very interesting, because of the linkage between the film characters.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing the first look, I was afraid that this young Spider-man might be overshadowed by Iron Man, but those parts really well done. Comparing it with the 15 years ago Spider-man, the technology has been the biggest change. That's why I still love Tobey Maguire film. Very simple and down to the earth without cell phones, computers. But the current superhero films are all alien oriented/connected theme, and of course digital technology a big leap. Hoping the next film too would impress us with the same intensity. So lets wait for summer 2019.\r\n\r\n_7/10_",

From the scene with the nunchucks to swords to shotguns to hatchets to hand-to-hand - among the greatest, if not the pinnacle, of action choreography.

But the absolute standout is Donnie Yen; his speed and skill are breathtaking as he steals every scene he is in. Unfortunately, despite all of its stunning brilliance, the story takes a lot of shortcuts to wrap up John Wick’s story, which disappoints a little. The method to end it all seems like something that would have been mentioned several movies ago. But honestly, who cares? We don’t go to a John Wick movie for a deep story.

  "content": "Now this is an whole lot better than \"John Wick - Paracetamol\" (2019) but it is still not very good. This time our wandering warrior (Keanu Reeves) is out for revenge, but not before the all-powerful \"Marquis\" (Bill Skarsgård), who has managed to get those at the \"High Table\" to give him complete control of their global operations, decides to seek some of his own - and that includes trashing the New York hotel and putting \"Winston\" (Ian McShane) out of an home and a job. A rather unnecessary, and fatal, side effect of that activity put's his nose out of joint too; and when the \"Marquis\" turns his attention on Osaka - possibly the last bastion of support for \"Wick\", we just know that we are in for a series of never-ending hand-to-hand fisticuffs that are straight out of a video game. Indeed, for almost all of the action sequences here the whole point seems to be: kill as many of the useless, hapless - but heavily armed - enemy as you can whilst perhaps bleeding a little from the mouth now and again. Use your finely tailored Kevlar®️ suit to deflect bullets, blades, flames - just about everything as you, inevitably, survive against constantly insurmountable odds for well over 2½ hours before a denouement that is, admittedly, quite quirky. That involves a sort of Sacre-Coeur version of snakes and ladders but again, luckily, against innumerable would-be assassins who couldn't hit a barn door with an Howitzer at point blank range. Skarsgård isn't remotely menacing - like a poor \"James Bond\" villain in a perfectly measured suit, Laurence Fishburne features only sparingly and the whole thing has as much jeopardy as the 'Wizard of Oz\" (1939). Reeves does not act here, he performs - and the profusion of CGI, the complete lack of any police or domestic military in Japan, Paris or New York to address the increasingly chaotic and damaging carnage being caused in these locations all just wanted me to start shouting \"thwack\" and \"pow\" at the screen. There is a delightful twist at the end, but it's a very long time in the coming and to be perfectly honest, I was just a bit bored. I've never really been in love with this franchise, it's all too repetitive and predictable - and sadly, this is just the same.",

Still, the importance of lighting and camera work in the spectacular action set pieces is truly impressive - THAT sequence shot from above is an all-timer. Original remains supreme, nonetheless.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

This movie gave more importance to the script than the last 2 movies. Since the duration is long, they have processed each character beautifully. The script isn't at the forefront, though.\r\n\r\nActing: Actors in the movie have already proven themselves. It was all very good.\r\n\r\nMusic: It was nice to hear the music from the old movies too. However, there was also new music. Every music was suitable for the stage and very good.\r\n\r\nAction: Although there were exaggerated scenes about action, it was better than all the first 3 movies. In particular, there is an action scene shot from the top. That scene is one of the best I've ever seen in the cinema. You enjoy each scene of the action separately. You have trouble sitting in the chair.\r\n\r\nMovie Duration: Even though the movie is long, you never notice it. It was a very moving movie.\r\n\r\nOverall: This movie is definitely worth watching. It might be the best movie of the series.",

  "content": "I don’t need to tell you that the violent action in “John Wick: Chapter 4” is over the top. If you’re aware of the popular neo-noir action thriller franchise, you know that already. If you’re a fan of the smartly dressed, ass kicking antihero known on the streets as the Baba Yaga, you aren’t going to be disappointed in this rowdy, unrestrained fourth chapter. The bar has been raised and effectively met, as this fast-paced film traverses the globe, provides a dose of pure adrenaline, and leaves the franchise’s highest body count in its wake.\r\n\r\nAfter being excommunicated and on the run from a network of bounty hunters, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) has had enough and just wants out of the criminal underworld forever. He tries to kill them all but in the process, discovers a path to defeating The High Table with the goal of finally securing his freedom. John visits former friends, alliances, and foes all over the world, bringing trouble to their doorstep. The lethal assassin fights his way through one by one, culminating in a final duel to the death.\r\n\r\nThis is Reeves’ movie through and through, and he’s created what has arguably become one of the more iconic screen characters of the 21st century. It’s great to see old favorites like Winston (Ian McShane), Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), and Charon (Lance Reddick) return, but the addition of new characters Caine (Donnie Yen), Mr. Nobody (Shamier Anderson), and the brutally cruel Marquis (Bill Skarsgård) breathes fresh life into the franchise.\r\n\r\nThe story is weak and the performances not much better, but none of that matters if you’re a fan of pure action and cinematic spectacle. The stunt work (which is heavily influenced by martial arts) reaches absolute perfection, will impeccably choreographed fight sequences that are fresh, inventive, and exciting. The best of the best is a thrilling shootout in the middle of busy traffic by the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. It’s one of those scenes that makes you want to stand up and cheer.\r\n\r\nDirector Chad Stahelski is an ex-stuntman himself, and he knows how to orchestrate exhilarating, handsome action sequences. This isn’t a film with rapid cutting where you can’t tell what is going on, and it’s a return to a classic style that should be welcomed by fans of the genre. You can clearly follow each blow to the body, every bloody gunshot to the head, and every sword through the back. Stahelski’s vision is as close to flawless as one can get, and this is a great looking movie from start to finish.\r\n\r\nDespite all of the things that are done right, the film’s excessive runtime makes it seem too indulgent. Even with the breathtaking fight choreography and stunt coordination, some of the action scenes go on so long that I started to lose interest. A few are repetitive and exhausting, but the short and well-placed breaks in the form of emotional storytelling bring a welcome respite and a bit of breathing room.\r\n\r\n“John Wick: Chapter 4” is a film that over promises yet over delivers for action fans. It’s one rousing, wild ride.\r\n\r\n**By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS / WWW.SCREENZEALOTS.COM**",

  "content": "John Wick 4 is an absolute masterpiece of an action film. From start to finish, this movie delivers an adrenaline-fueled experience that will leave you breathless. The action is intense, with each fight scene being expertly choreographed and executed. The action set pieces are some of the most memorable I've ever seen, with each one being more jaw-dropping than the last.\r\n\r\nOne of the standout aspects of John Wick 4 is the villains. This time around, they are more interesting than ever, with big-name actors bringing their A-game to their respective roles. It's always great to see veteran actors like Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne on screen, but the addition of newcomers like Bill Skarsgard and Donnie Yen really elevates the movie.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the real star of John Wick 4 is the fight cinematography. The one-take fight scene that was filmed from overhead is a work of art. It's so seamless and fluid that you feel like you're right there in the middle of the action. The attention to detail in every fight scene is astounding, with each punch and kick feeling like it has real weight behind it.\r\n\r\nOne slight negative of the movie is that John Wick doesn't have much development. However, this is a minor quibble, as the movie is so focused on delivering incredible action that the lack of character development doesn't really matter. After all, John Wick is at his best when he's kicking ass, and he certainly does that in spades in this movie.\r\n\r\nOverall, John Wick 4 is a fantastic entry in the series. The sense of finality that permeates throughout the movie is perfect, and it really feels like a fitting end to the story. If you're a fan of action movies, then John Wick 4 is an absolute must-see. It's a thrilling ride that will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.\r\n\r\nScore: 93%\r\nVerdict: Excellent",

  "content": "***The cream of the crop of quirky crime thrillers***\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 1994 and written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, \"Pulp Fiction\" is a drama/thriller/black comedy about two hit men in Los Angeles (John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson), their mob boss & his wife (Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman) and a champion boxer who incurs the wrath of the boss (Bruce Willis).\r\n\r\nThe lurid, droll tale is told in a non-linear fashion, but it's easy to follow and the final act ties everything up nicely. The dialogue's witty and the story maintains your attention, despite its 2 hour and 34 minutes runtime. The film's stylish and pulsates with energy and innovation; it understandably influenced many 90's films and beyond.\r\n\r\nI put off seeing this iconic picture until almost twenty years after its release because the protagonists are all big city gangsters or somehow involved with 'em. These are lawless people who would kill a person without batting an eye. Their god is money or hedonism. Let ’em shoot each other to smithereens for all I care. But if you can look beyond this and the constant profanities, the film's worth your time. What redeems it for me, besides the all-around entertaining movie-making, is that it's a tale of redemption and the high price of stubborn folly: The wise person recognizes God’s grace and responds accordingly while the fool doesn’t and blithely goes on his (doomed) way. Once a person receives grace they naturally extend it to others. There are additional gems spiced throughout.\r\n\r\nBoth Travolta and Jackson shine here. There are several other celebrities on hand, like Harvey Keitel, with many in cameos, e.g. Christopher Walken; not to mention several formidable females, like curvy Julia Sweeney (Raquel), cutie Maria de Medeiros (Fabienne), Angela Jones (Esmarelda) and voluptuous Susan Griffiths (Marilyn Monroe).\r\n\r\nBOTTOM LINE: If you're in the mood for a quirky crime drama/thriller you can't go wrong with \"Pulp Fiction.\" It's top-of-the-line in every way, including the subtext.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM WAS SHOT in the Greater Los Angeles area.

  "content": "Ving Rhames (\"Wallace\") is the kingpin who provides the loosest of templates for a couple of inter-twining tales that are amusing, bizarre and sometimes down right dangerous before we get a sort of alignment at the conclusion. \"Winnfield\" (Samuel L. Jackson) and \"Vincent Vega\" (John Travolta) are a pair of dapper enforcers, despatched to retrieve a stolen briefcase. Though their manner may be precise, the execution of their tasks are usually more hit and miss, definitely messy - and frequently requiring of the specialist clean-up services of \"Mr. Wolf\" (Harvey Keitel). \"Vega\" is also charged by his boss with looking after his cocaine-loving wife \"Mia\" (Uma Thurman) and that flirts with dancing and disaster too. Meantime, ageing boxer \"Butch\" (Bruce Willis) is supposed to help the boss by taking an early dive in a fight. Instead he manages to kill his opponent! Soon he is intent on fleeing town, well at least he tries before he and \"Wallace\" end up being the playthings of some interesting characters who keep their own leather-clad gimp locked in a box... It's really difficult to make sense of the narrative in writing. It flows really well, but at differing speeds and in several different directions at once. The stories are violent but delivered in an almost tongue-in cheek way. The dance between \"Mia\" and \"Vega\" has become the stuff of cinema legend; there is loads of chemistry - especially between Travolta and an on form Jackson who really does deliver his biblical verses with a puritanical - an lethal - zeal; Willis is as good here as he ever was and you cannot but feel sorry for poor old \"Pumpkin\" (Tim Roth) and his pal \"Honey Bunny\" (Amanda Plummer) whose habit of committing petty robberies when they realise that nobody ever thinks to hit a restaurant, all goes awry. The dialogue is cleverly targeted, with wit and pith but also used sparingly when the first rate soundtrack is allowed to let everyone come up for air. Tarantino himself features towards the end as just about everybody gets their just desserts. This is a classy and sharp piece of enigmatic and enjoyable cinema held together well by a creative and visionary director who appreciates how to get the best of a cast that know how to entertain!",

  "content": "**One of the unavoidable movies to know Tarantino… but I think it's not as incredible as it is sometimes said to be.**\r\n\r\nThis was one of the films that consolidated Tarantino's career and made him one of the \"superstar\" directors who, whenever he releases a film, whether good or bad, attracts a legion to the cinema. I was never a fan of his, and I don't think I will be. He made some films that I liked and others that I hated. I wouldn't call it regular, a “safe bet”, but we can't deny it, it's original, true to his style and doesn't seem concerned about pleasing anyone.\r\n\r\nThe film follows more than one plot: we have a couple of violent bandits who try to rob a cafeteria, we have a boxer at the end of his career who has to flee after winning a fight he had agreed he would lose, we have a couple of murderers in the pay of a mobster who are tasked with recovering a stolen suitcase, and we also have the capricious girlfriend of that same mobster, whose boredom forces her darling to assign one of his assassins to babysit for her. What unites them all? In addition to the fact that they naturally intersect, they are all part of the same violent, brutal and marginal universe.\r\n\r\nFor many, this film is one of the best of the 90's. I would never consider it as such, that is, for me, an exaggeration. It's reasonably good, it's gained cult status, it has fans, but it's not a masterpiece, not for me. It's not a boring film, it doesn't tire us out and the various sub-plots are intertwined very well, with skill and elegance. There's a lot of violence, heavy slang and drugs, and that can be really hard at times, I felt that too. However, this heavier language, drugs and violence end up being a natural part of the underworld of crime and marginality where the characters move, so it's something we can count on right from the start. And there are no sympathetic characters who can arouse some empathy, so it doesn't matter to us whether they live or die in the most unpleasant ways (and some of them suffer a lot).\r\n\r\nThese are all qualities, and will be even more valued by those who are more familiar with the “pulp” literary subgenre. I'm not, it's not part of my culture, and I even had to go look it up on the Internet to understand what it was, and what its characteristics were. Despite that, there are a few things about this film that I really didn't like or felt over the top. One of them is the dialogues. There are scenes with a lot of dialogues, dialogues without any interest, which can dwell on boring topics, just because. One of them, right at the beginning of the film, is about foot massages, just to give a small example. There are many scenes that seem overly drawn out due to these endless dialogues. I also think the film has too many images of bare feet. Tarantino gained fame as a fetishist, but he always said he wasn't… watching this film makes it hard to believe him. And one of the characters, who is a murderer, makes a very long quote from the Bible… it's the kind of “literature” that I think an underworld murderer probably wouldn't know by heart.\r\n\r\nThe actors are very good, we have several notable names: John Travolta is excellent in the role he was given, with that black suit and his hair soaked in oil. Samuel L. Jackson is not far behind, and Uma Thurman is fantastic. I would say that, at least, Thurman and Travolta achieve performances at the best level of their respective careers in this film. Bruce Willis isn't bad, but he's just not that interesting. I enjoyed seeing my countrywoman Maria de Medeiros in her only major international role, I'm sorry she couldn't go further, but that's life. Tarantino also appears in the film, and it would have been much better if he hadn't. He's a ham as an actor.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film has many qualities, starting with the excellent cinematography, with vivid colors and good lighting. There are excellent action scenes, for all tastes, and the soundtrack makes good use of several musical themes that we know very well.",

This makes for a strong return into my world.\r\n\r\nMalek is the beating heart of the movie, as you'd expect.

  "content": "“Heller” (Rami Malek) is the geeky “Jack Ryan” type, stuck in an office five floors below sunlight working on intelligence gathering and decrypting for the CIA. Intrigued by his latest set of dossiers from a deep throat somewhere on the internet, he suspects he has stumbled upon something nefarious. Before he has time to investigate, though, he hears that his wife has been the victim of a terrorist attack in London and so now he’s seeing red. Using the information he has recently obtained as leverage, he gets himself trained and equipped for an operational mission to get some revenge. Thing is, “Heller” isn’t a natural born killer, and despite the best efforts of his handler “Henderson” (Laurence Fishburne) he isn’t considered likely to be much more effective than a wet lettuce when it comes to killing anyone. What we now see is that there are more ways than one to skin a cat and brain can sometimes overcome brawn if applied with plenty of explosives, sticky tape and even the odd rogue missile. That’s perhaps the problem with this film: we’ve seen it all before - and more compellingly, too. Malek does enough but the rest of the cast really underwhelm and the set-piece action scenes come all too few and far between before an ending that really just fizzles out. James Hawes has presented us with a great looking film, packed with gadgets and gizmos, and the story also does make you realise just how big brotherly society has become with cameras apparently everywhere manipulating imagery from your shadow cast on a water-filled dustbin lid - but after a while, that all becomes a little repetitive and the plot settles into an implausible predictability. It has it’s moments, but sadly that’s all they are and this is a film that you’ll soon forget all about.",

Harry faces getting expelled and finds himself shunned by many around him. This at a time when the Ministry of Magic compounds his misery by insisting to all and sundry that \"you know who\" is not back again.\r\n\r\nGiven that JK Rowling's fifth book is considered to be something of a door stopper, a book more of interim Potter filler than any great amount of substance, credit has to go to new to the franchise director, David Yates. For Yates and his screenwriter Michael Goldenberg have managed to craft a briskly entertaining segment in under 2 hours and 20 minutes of film. Yes it's safe to say that it ultimately does feel like an interim filler movie, one that is for fans and not newcomers to the series, but the effects are superb (except Grawp that is), the action is much and suspense is not in short supply. While it also finds Radcliffe as Potter finally hitting his acting stride.\r\n\r\nNew into the magical fray comes the wonderful Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbrage, the sort of cheery psychotic teacher we all had bad dreams about in our formative years. Also most welcome is Helena Bonham Carter as nut job harpy Bellatrix Le Strange, it's an appetiser of substance and we can't wait to see some more of her from here on in. Of course the usual problem of not enough screen time for the regulars still exists, but it's now become a figure of grumpy acceptance in the grand scheme of Potter World. Neatly keeping the story trimmed of extraneous fat, Yates doesn't disappoint in delivering a last quarter as memorable as any so far in the series. Big rewards await those who wait, because the showdown that crowns Order of Phoenix is a magical mêlée of wands and wonderment; a face off between good and evil, a free for all that joyously assaults the senses.\r\n\r\nRoll on Half-Blood Prince, where it's great to know that Yates has been further entrusted with the Harry Potter reins. 7.5/10",

  "content": "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is another solid entry into the series with fantastically high stakes, production value, and emotional scenes that leave a lasting impact.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning minutes, the movie is doubling down on the dark tone the previous two began to establish. The threat of Voldemort still looms, but it is incredibly frustrating that no one seems to believe Harry and Dumbledore. That frustration is perfectly mirrored with Harry as he grows incredibly angry throughout the film, paralleling his connection with the Dark Lord. This more mature and seasoned Potter is a highlight, and his leadership begins to take center stage as he organizes his classmates to train to fight against the dark arts. These scenes are some of my favorites in the film.\r\n\r\nThis entry expands on the wizarding world with the Ministry of Magic and the Order of the Phoenix. The Ministry of Magic is terrible in this film, they are completely mad and delusional to accept any other explanation for the events that have taken place in the previous entries. This is none more present than the introduction of Mrs. Umbridge. She is the worst, and Imelda Staunton does an excellent job of being the worst. I hated her throughout the entire film and every one of her sly smiles was like nails on a chalkboard. Safe to say her finale was oh-so-satisfying.\r\n\r\nThe ending is slightly rushed, but the action is fantastic. It was a bit unbelievable that a group of students could face the Death Eaters by themselves, but the movie addressed the criticism when the Order came to save the day. I do have to say, the death scene of Sirius Black was pretty anti-climactic. The hit he takes happens so fast and he gingerly falls back into the portal never to be seen again, it did not have the resolution I would have hoped for with him being such an influential person in Harry's life. Plus, his limited screen time in the series draws back the effectiveness of his death. Despite that, the special effects in the Dumbledore and Voldemort battle were spectacular and unique, a brilliant way to cap off the film. Especially with the ending shot of Cornelius Fudge just realizing \"He's Back\"\r\n\r\nOverall, this is a slow movie with a limited amount of action. But the world-building and character development are some of the best in the series. It is not going to be everyone's favorite, but it was a great addition, even though the rewatchability is not that high.\r\n\r\nScore: 85% | \r\nVerdict Great",

A new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher (a rather Margaret Thatcher-esque Imelda Staunton) is taking over the school by degree, imposing strict rules that merely serve to encourage the pupils to go underground to learn the more practical skills that will be needed if they are ever to face and defeat the evil \"Voldemort\". All of the characters from the previous stories are now knitting together much better; I still miss Richard Harris as \"Dumbledore\" but Stauton is as magnificently evil as Emma Thompson is wonderfully pathetic and we have a cracking battle at the end. Our wizards are now fully cognisant of the dangers they face and have a much clearer idea of the enemy, too. David Yates does better, I think, in condensing this super-long novel into one film; again a two-parter would probably have done better justice to the detail and nuances of the JK Rowling story; but we get more than enough of the gist of the story to make do.

  "content": "I usually think that a good spell of time between an original and a sequel is a good thing. It gives everyone space to refresh the ideas and develop the characterisations. That's pretty much what Gore Verbinsky has done with this superior follow-up to the 2003 story. This time, we don't really need to spend much time on the who's who bits, so can head straight to the action which for the next 2½ hours follows \"Jack Sparrow\" (Johnny Depp) double-dealing as only he can trying to stay one step ahead of the vengeful \"Davy Jones\" (Bill Nighy) with whom he made a deal that means it's now his turn to enter hell. Meantime, \"Will\" (Orlando Bloom) and \"Elizabeth\" (Keira Knightley) are having problems of their own, and when he has to try to kidnap \"Jack\" with his compass for the dastardly \"Lord Beckett\" (Tom Hollander) in return for her safety he, en route, becomes reunited with his rather curmudgeonly (and barnacled) father (Stellan Skarsgård). It seems that both \"Will\" and \"Jack\" cannot both get what they need - but can they find a solution? It's end-to-end stuff this, with loads of mythical creatures from the depths, a tiny bit of romance and a Johnny Depp very much at the top of his game. The story is solid and entertaining, as is much of the quickly paced dialogue and David Schofield turns in a good effort as the malevolent \"Mercer\". I could have done with Geoffrey Rush but otherwise this is a fun fantasy adventure with some cracking visual effects and Hans Zimmer's music adds richness to the jollity too. A big screen must, really. It's just not so good on the telly.",

It follows his hit-and-miss _Napoleon_ biopic last year, which was rather miss than hit. The sequel captures the original's essence while introducing elements, making it a worthy successor.\r\n\r\nPaul Mescal in the lead role - inherited from the ever-growling Russel Crowe, who was at the top of his career in the original - holds his ground against Denzel Washington, whose charisma cleaves through the screen as effortlessly as his character's sword.\r\n\r\nRidley Scott admits he was prompted to revisit _Gladiator_ by the acclaim he received from those too young to have seen the original on the big screen. His mission to lure Gen Z away from their streaming devices may help to save cinema, ushering in a new era of appreciation for the big screen. But for the love of Jupiter, I hope they quickly learn that it isn't just a big iPad with comfy chairs. No pausing, swiping, mid-film selfies, dashes to the bar, or running commentary required. Screen four at your local cinema isn't the Colosseum but a place where the magic of film of this scale truly comes alive, offering a unique and immersive experience that can't be replicated at home.",

  "content": "<em>'Gladiator II'</em> is awesome!\r\n\r\nI only watched the original three years ago, almost to the day in fact, but I was anticipating this follow-up after thoroughly loving the Russell Crowe film. Honestly, I think I kinda enjoyed this sequel more - at worst, the two are on the same level, for me anyway. Crowe is missed, though everyone in this movie more than makes up for his (obvious) absence.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time I've seen Paul Mescal act, despite knowing of him for quite a while now. I'm impressed! He delivers a showing of great strength (pardon the pun). Pedro Pascal is very good too, as is Joseph Quinn; I wasn't instantly sold on the latter when he appeared onscreen, though when all is said and done I rate his performance positively.\r\n\r\nDenzel Washington... what a geezer. I'll never tire or turn down the chance at seeing that man act. Needless to say, given he's one of two favourite actors of mine, I loved his performance all the way through. The likes of Fred Hechinger and Connie Nielsen merit fair praise as well, interesting to see Rory McCann and Matt Lucas in there too.\r\n\r\nOh, and the score... superb! Deafeningly grand.",

  "content": "Sixteen years after \"Maximus\" (Russell Crowe) bit the dust, we find ancient Rome under the control of twins \"Geta\" (Joseph Quinn) and his brother \"Caracalla\" (Fred Hechinger) and thanks to their general \"Acacias\" (Pedro Pascal) continuing to expand their empire. It's this latter man who leads an attack on the home \"Nanno\" (Paul Mescal) shares with his wife \"Arishat\" (Yuval Gonen). That doesn't go so well and next thing, she's gone on ahead of him to the wheat fields and he's now a slave owned by the manipulative \"Macrinus\" (Denzel Washington) heading to the Colosseum to entertain the emperors and their cousin \"Lucilla\" (Connie Nielsen). What now ensues is a well produced and good looking rehash of the first film paying homage en route to \"Spartacus\" and it's the sheer predicability that I struggled with. It's episodically delivered with far too much script and though Mescal tries hard, his performance is largely charm-free and as wooden as a rudius, especially once the rather far-fetched familial back-story has been established. Sir Derek Jacobi sparingly appears as the other survivor from 2000 reprising his role as the senator \"Gracchus\" but to no real effect and the scene stealer for me is really only the megalomanic Quinn's imperial offering as he and his bonkers sibling teeter on the brink of inbred, sexually fluid, madness. Washington does well enough as the scheming slave-master, but he hasn't really enough to work with to stand out amongst what really are a mediocre collection of undercooked characters that just don't deliver any real sense of the hedonism and menace of this debauched and corrupt state. As with Sir Ridley Scott's \"Kingdom of Heaven\" (2005) the battle scenes are superb and action packed, as are the combat scenes in the vast marble auditorium filled with baying plebs and rhinos, but I am afraid that the shallow characterisations just didn't work well enough to keep this engaging and the plot was just too thin to stretch over a couple of hours that could have been so very much better. It really does need a big screen to appreciate the creatively crafted visuals, but I was still pretty disappointed, sorry.",

  "content": "Gladiator II features some impressive action sequences. Every battle in the Colosseum is fantastic despite how historically inaccurate they may be. The monkey sequence showcases how skilled Hanno (Paul Mescal) is not only as a fighter but also in how he interacts with others. Then there's the rhino sequence that plays out much like Bugs Bunny’s interactions with Toro the Bull in the Chuck Jones-directed Looney Tunes short Bully for Bugs (1953).\r\n\r\nWhile those sequences are fairly believable, the shark sequence seems like pure fantasy and that’s why it’s so incredible. They fill the Colosseum with water and let sharks loose while the opposing gladiators try to survive the onslaught on boats.\r\n\r\nIt’s also interesting to note that every major actor who dies in the film has a spectacular death. Not only that but these gruesome deaths get increasingly more grisly and memorable as the film progresses. These bloody triumphs rarely delve any deeper than someone getting shot with a bunch of arrows or a beheading or appendage severing of some kind. This level of brutality escalates throughout the film and eventually culminates with the most satisfying kill that takes two and a half hours to achieve.\r\n\r\nThe performances fluctuate between being top-tier perfection and mediocre overacting. Denzel Washington is having the time of his life as Macrinus. He has the most interesting storyline and Denzel dances in every scene with a giddiness that is unparalleled. Joseph Quinn seems to be acting in an entirely different film than everyone else as Emperor Geta. His mannerisms are operatic and theatrical with his wide eyes that rarely blink, grand body language and hand gestures, and explosive line delivery.\r\n\r\nPedro Pascal doesn’t do anything in Gladiator II as Marcus Acacius that he didn’t do in Game of Thrones apart from having more screen time. Much like how his character is written, Paul Mescal’s performance is muddled. The Hanno character and who he is is a poorly kept secret that consistently pulls the character in several directions.\r\n\r\nHanno is vengeful at first before succumbing to being the hero of the film and the evolution isn’t earned. The writing and pacing of Gladiator II feel like the film drops Hanno’s fate in his lap halfway through, which he’s either forgotten about over two decades or never knew until the audience did.\r\n\r\nConnie Nielsen, one of the few returning actors from the original film, is awful in this. Her acting in Gladiator II always comes off as forced as her crying scenes are often portrayed as constipated grunts with crocodile tears. Her dialogue delivery is also strained and broken despite being given some of the most important sequences of character connections and reawakenings of sorts in the sequel.\r\n\r\nCalling Gladiator II action-heavy is misleading because the film drags between every fight sequence. The film is largely dull and difficult to indulge during its quieter moments. The film is gorgeous with its incredible set pieces, intricate costume design, and impressive use of infinitely numerous extras. Director Ridley Scott reunites with all of the set decorators (Sonja Klaus, Crispian Sallis, and Emilio Ardura) and costume designer (Janty Yates) that he worked with on Gladiator in 2000. From a visual standpoint, Ridley Scott's films are highly detailed masterpieces.\r\n\r\nDenzel Washington’s extravagant performance makes Gladiator II worthwhile. Still, not even its excessively violent action sequences, beautiful cinematography, and masterful set and costume design can save the sequel from how boring it is. Ridley Scott waited over twenty years to make a sequel that is more than twice as expensive as the original only to rehash the same story points.",

In a city where the various elements live and work can have its challenges, especially to the destructive nature of fire which causes some prejudice against them as well as their natural distrust of water.\r\n\r\nEmber is preparing for the day that she will take over the family business however her inability to deal with customers leads to combustible outrage which in turn results in a flooding incident at their business. Further compounding matters is the fact that a city inspector named Wade (Mamoudou Athie), who is a water element has been sucked into the basement and promptly documents multiple violations that shut down the business.\r\n\r\nDesperate to undo the damage, Ember strikes a deal that she will work with Wade to locate and fix the source of the leak in a few days time which will result in the removal of the infractions against the family home and business.\r\n\r\nAlong the Way, Wade and Ember start to grow close however the incompatibility of their two elements presents an obstacle as does the various elements of their respective societies.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a charming and visually appealing adventure that tugs at the heartstrings the way that the best Pixar films can.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple thematic elements at play and they're presented in a very matter-of-fact way that doesn't become overly preachy and can appeal to viewers of all age levels.

It will be very interesting to see what the future holds for the characters as there are certainly opportunities to revisit them in the future which would be very welcome as \"Elemental\" is a very charming and engaging return to form for Pixar and the perfect summer film for the entire family.",

  "content": "\"Ember\" and her ailing grandfather arrive in the big city where everyone is personified as one of the four natural elements. Needless to say, fire is not the most popular but they resolve to open their shop selling all things smoked, toasted, burnt, and red hot! It's an old building, though, and when one day the pipes give birth to the local, watery, buildings inspector \"Wade\" she discovers that they have no planning permission for their business and that he is going to have to report them. What now ensues is, sadly, a rather unimaginative series of escapades as she must track him down and stop him - and the authorities - from closing down the family's flaming enterprise. The animation is characterful and top notch - and the story certainly had potential, but somehow the thing just becomes a bit of a cheesy romance all too quickly. A lot more fun could have been had demonstrating just how incompatible the four - air, earth, water and fire - can be when mixed together; or - indeed - how symbiotic they can be, but the emphasis and the dialogue focusses just a bit too much on \"Ember\" and \"Wade\" and I am afraid that I rather lost interest. It's colourful and vibrant, there is some entertaining action with plenty of pyrotechnics and is worth a watch, but it will look just as good on the television and doesn't live up to the hype, sorry",

It goes beyond being just a rom-com and instead offers a powerful narrative about people, even though the characters represent elements.

The film highlights the idea that despite our differences, we can coexist in a society that often tries to separate us. \"Elemental\" stands out as one of the most visually colourful movies with excellent music, including a memorable end credits song. While children may not fully grasp the film's deep concepts, it leaves a lasting impact on their lives, and when they revisit it as adults, they will come to understand its profound message.",

  "content": "It has to get at least three stars because it's got Dan Stevens (and his piercing eyes) in it. Otherwise, this is an entirely derivative and predictable effort that leaves nothing at all to our imagination. A truce has broken out since the last time (2021), with \"Kong\" ruling the roost deep in \"Hollow Earth\"; \"Godzilla\" curled up asleep in the Coliseum and \"Ilene\" (Rebecca Hall) and the troubled \"Jia\" (Kaylee Hottle) keeping an eye on things for \"Monarch\" and mankind. \"Kong\" has a bad tooth so he comes to the humans for help. Fortunately, \"Trapper\" (the aforementioned DS) is a dab hand at grand-scale dentistry but it's while the ape is topside that alarm bells go off. \"Godzilla\" starts marauding again and an undiscovered vortex in the nether world requires investigation by \"Kong\" and his human pals. With \"Bernie\" (Brian Tyree Henry) back in the gang, off they all go to discover that a new menace has arrived, destroyed their monitoring outpost and it is now setting up a battle royal with just about every Titan left on Earth - above or below. Adam Winyard does just about everything on this film, and that shows in a complete lack of objectivity when evaluating this third rate adventure, the banal writing and equally lacklustre acting. It's as plain as the nose on your face why \"Godzilla' - who doesn't feature so much in this - is collecting energy, and when we do eventually get to them, the combat scenes are repetitive and too tightly choreographed. The scale is all over the place too. At times \"Kong\" appears the size of an house, at others he's more like a mouse. The visual effects are put to good use, but Hall just underwhelms, Henry talks way too much and Stevens' busky humour just doesn't hit home at all. I know it's difficult to keep coming up with new ideas for this genre and it must be difficult for the actors to constantly engage with nothing but some greenscreen, but the story is thin and the film reminds you of just about everything from \"Jurassic Park\" to episodes of \"Stargate\". It does need a big screen, though. On television it will be even more forgettable - but I did like the moth.",

  "content": "A whole load of nothing!\r\n\r\n<em>'Godzilla × Kong: The New Empire'</em> is not a good movie, in my opinion anyway. It is similar to its predecessor in that sense at least, this is a minute improvement on that 2021 entry mind. It's basically a Kong film though, Godzilla goes missing for large periods. There is less human to be found onscreen which is good to see, but what's added in its place with Kong is just so dull to me.\r\n\r\nThe needless humanising of Kong continues, though this time it's actually done in and around the other monsters because... well, actually I'm not sure why monsters are acting human-like to each other but, eh, the movie, I guess. That Suko young ape character is particularly annoying too, it sounded like a clown horn and looks more belonging to that one Coldplay music video.\r\n\r\nThe whole film feels like if <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/avatar-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avatar</a>'</em> and the <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/films/in/planet-of-the-apes-reboot-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Planet of the Apes</a>'</em> reboots had a baby and that's not a positive. It felt watching that it was also taking bits and pieces from other films too, mind perhaps that's just me reaching? The best scene of it all features the two titular characters in Giza, their bits together in Hollow Earth are decent too but their opponents are incredibly lame.\r\n\r\nCast-wise, it's OK. Rebecca Hall and Kaylee Hottle are as fine as previously, Brian Tyree Henry is marginally improved and Dan Stevens is serviceable. None of the others are all that noteworthy to me, but that actually is a true plus for this production; last time out I wanted less humans and less humans is what we get here.\r\n\r\nMy review kinda reads as if I hate this 2024 release. I do not, there are far worse pictures out there of course. It's just a heap of disappointment. I guess I just want pure, turn-off-your-brain titan carnage from these flicks, which evidently is not what the Monsterverse is necessarily trying to do... that's probably on me.\r\n\r\nCatching up on this franchise has made me want to even more check out the 'proper' Godzilla releases out of Japan, so there is that. As for these American ones, I like <em>'Kong: Skull Island'</em> at least...",

They don't feel like self-contained polished products anymore, they feel like filler episodes filled with smaller barely connected filler episodes. Godzilla x Kong is like the opening to Age of Ultron, except it's the majority of the movie. You just don't really feel grounded at all.\r\n\r\nThere's too much music. They try to recapture the \"magic\" of the intro and ending of Godzilla vs Kong but it fails spectacularly. It was cute there because the focus was on Kong and they didn't overdo it. Here the focus is on Trapper AKA NOT Kong AKA no one cares about Trapper because not giving the man a name is doing a stupid.\r\n\r\nThe monster action is fine. Kong meeting the other Great Apes got me pumped and the finale is lackluster but satisfying enough.\r\n\r\nSo, Season 2 of Monarch when?",

  "content": "Get this: what if all we know as reality was, in fact, virtual reality? Reality itself is a ravaged dystopia run by technocrat Artificial Intelligence where humankind vegetates in billions of gloop-filled tanks - mere battery packs for the machineworld - being fed this late '90s VR (known as The Matrix - you with us here?) through an ugly great cable stuck in the back of our heads. And what if there was a group of quasi-spiritual rebels infiltrating The Matrix with the sole purpose of crashing the ruddy great mainframe and rescuing humans from their unknown purgatory? And, hey, what if Keanu Reeves was their Messiah?\r\n\r\nWhat sounds like some web freak's wet dream is, in fact, a dazzlingly nifty slice of sci-fi cool. The Wachowski Brothers (Andy and Larry - last seen dabbling in kinky lesbian noir with the excellent Bound) pulling off something like a million masterstrokes all at once. Taking the imprimatur of the video game, they meld the grungy noir of Blade Runner, the hyperkinetic energies of chopsocky, John Woo hardware and grandiose spiritual overtones into William Gibson's cyberpunk ethos to produce a new aesthetic for the millennium powered to the thudding beat of techno. And it is just incredible fun. The key is the technique of \"flo-mo\", a process born from Japanese animation, whereby an object in motion is seemingly frozen while the camera miraculously spins around it as if time and gravity are on hold. It grants the action (including some killer kung fu which Reeves and crew spent months perfecting) liberty to take on surreal visual highs. Superhuman feats permissible, of course, in the context of VR as the rebels download Herculean \"talents\" to fuel their subterfuge. Meanwhile, the audience can only gawp longingly, with its jaws thunking to the cinema floor in unison, as the heroes wrapped in skintight leather, sleek shades and designer cheekbones, spin up walls, leap from high rises and slip through streams of bullets in silken slo-mo. Tron this ain't.\r\n\r\nImmediately reigniting the moribund cyberpunk genre (the kids can't get enough Stateside), this has thrust Reeves from his imploding career back to Speed highs (and laying to rest the hideous ghost of Johnny Mnemonic) and stolen much more of Star Wars' thunder than was thought humanly possible. For all its loony plot, The Matrix is fabulous.\r\n\r\nSure, the expert Fishburne is depended upon to expound the lion's share of the script as seer-like rebel leader Morpheus. Reeves, stunning in his newcast slenderness, as Thomas \"Neo\" Anderson, the hacker turned hope for all mankind (care of some ill-defined mystical calling) is asked little more than perpetual befuddlement. Like Speed, though, this movie plays on his iconic looks rather than his oak-like emoting. There's a major find, too, in the irresistible Carrie-Anne Moss, a majestically wrought combination of steely no-shit intelligence and rock-chick vivaciousness as fellow tripper Trinity. And Weaving, cast against type, neutralises his Aussie tones to a freaky deadpan, the head of the MiB-styled defence system set against the Goth invaders.\r\n\r\nAnd sure, three minutes of post-movie deliberation and all this state-of-the-art cyberdevilry is reduced to the purest gobbledygook. That, though, is not the point. The Matrix is about pure experience; it's been many a moon since the Empire crew have spilled out of a cinema literally buzzing with the sensation of a movie, babbling frenetically with the sheer excitement of discovery.\r\n\r\nFrom head to tail, the deliciously inventive Wachowskis (watch them skyrocket) have delivered the syntax for a new kind of movie: technically mind-blowing, style merged perfectly with content and just so damn cool, the usher will have to drag you kicking and screaming back into reality. You can bet your bottom dollar George never saw this phantom menace coming.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict - The deliciously inventive Wachowskis have delivered the syntax for a new kind of movie: technically mind-blowing, style merged perfectly with content and just so damn cool.\r\n\r\n5/5\r\n\r\n- Ian Nathan, Empire Magazine",

The casting is great and Carrie-Anne is stunning throughout (I usually don’t like short hair on women, but she’s an exception). For me, though, the Waschowskis made it too comic booky. The posturing characters in their slick black outfits & sunglasses scream “Yeah, right.” And the Messiah angle is old hat.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 16 minutes, and was shot in Sydney, Australia, with some exterior scenes done in Nashville and San Francisco.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B",

It set the high water mark for sci-fi action.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those movies that re-defined a genre.",

  "content": "\"Thomas Anderson\" is a nerdy boy by day, and an enigmatic hacker \"Neo\" by night. His latter persona is constantly challenging his norms, his behaviour, his reality even - and when he is contacted by Carrie-Anne Moss \"Trinity\" his suspicions begin to pan out and he is introduced to a crew of rebels led by \"Morpheus\" (Laurence Fishburne) on a mission to expose the extent to which mankind is merely a plaything of the \"Matrix\" living entirely imagined lives. The system is onto them, though, and using Hugo Weaving's \"Agent Smith\" and a fifth columnist from within the group's own ranks, is bent on their destruction. This film has that scarce value of having exciting (rather than delicately choreographed) action scenes married together with an intelligent, at times quite thought-provoking dialogue mixing fact/fiction and religiosity on a clever premiss that once we start to question reality; the conspiracy theories can run wild - and right to the top! Is \"Neo\" the one to save humanity - some sort of resurrected \"one\"? The Wachowski Brother remind us how to make a good sci-fi fantasy, but also that in his day Keanu Reeves was a one of the best, his boy-next-door good looks, agility and charisma working very well here. Of course the effects have dated, but one you've been subsumed into the plot - and if you are watching on a big screen - then that matters not; it's a gripping chunk of cinema depicting loyalty, determination and integrity that I really enjoyed.",

  "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nDavid Fincher’s new film, Mank, is coming soon on Netflix, released six years after his latest installment, Gone Girl. Therefore, this week I’m reviewing five of Fincher’s movies. Se7en was the first one, and now it’s time for one of the most culturally impactful films of the 90s, Fight Club. This is another rewatch of another filmmaking classic, one that I was never able to absolutely adore like most people. When this movie came out in 1999, critics were extremely divided, and the film failed at the box office. With time, it gained a cult following through home media, but it’s still considered a very controversial piece of cinema. So, nothing new, having in mind Fincher is at the helm.\r\n\r\nDespite this being my third or fourth time experiencing this story, I never really changed my opinion about it, which is a bit uncommon in my viewing history. Usually, after multiple rewatches, my overall thoughts about a movie slightly vary, but Fight Club is one of the few exceptions. I believe my opinion remains intact from the very first watch. I really enjoy this film, but I can’t state that I absolutely love it. Since this is a special case, I’m going to start with what still bothers me after so many viewings, something I also rarely do in my reviews since I always leave the bad stuff to the end of the article.\r\n\r\nWithout spoiling anything, of course, there’s a vital plot twist that comes later in the movie that I could only appreciate by its execution, but never by its impact on the narrative. Jim Uhls’ screenplay relies on the main characters’ friendship to carry the story forward, and throughout the first two acts, Fincher leaves not-that-subtle hints to a massive revelation, which eventually triggers the beginning of the third act. This major plot point is brilliantly executed, and I still feel incredibly fascinated by its delivery, both in terms of the dialogue and the performances. However, its impact on any lightly focused, observant viewer is close to zero due to the clear evidence that pointed towards this development.\r\n\r\nNow, I don’t want to sound like that stereotypical moviegoer that says, “I guessed the twist before its revelation, hence it all sucks”. Like I insinuate above, I was still wholly captivated during the entirety of the third act. Nevertheless, Fight Club’s runtime is far from being short, and Fincher spends a lot of time building up an idea that loses its surprise factor even before the film’s midpoint. It changes the protagonist’s perspective, it takes the viewer through a predictable yet entertaining path, setting up a powerful, meaningful ending. However, personally, I don’t feel like the time spent in the first two acts was satisfyingly compensated in the end… at least, not in its entirety.\r\n\r\nThe second act also has a short period where it loses a bit of steam due to some repetitive sequences and an unnecessary amount of flashbacks. Again, I feel like Fincher didn’t completely trust the audience back then, contrary to his procedure in Se7en. In the latter flick, Fincher left the biggest responsibility to the viewer’s imagination, leaving the murder scenes for the audience to picture in their minds. In Fight Club, that ambiguity and implicit dialogue are still present, sure, but even before the third act, there’s already an attempt to explain too much certain portions of the narrative that I wish would stay vaguer.\r\n\r\nWithout spoiling anything, of course, there’s a vital plot twist that comes later in the movie that I could only appreciate by its execution, but never by its impact on the narrative.

In Fight Club, that ambiguity and implicit dialogue are still present, sure, but even before the third act, there’s already an attempt to explain too much certain portions of the narrative that I wish would stay vaguer.\r\n\r\nDon’t worry, I’m done with the negatives, and don’t forget: I really, really like this movie. Obviously, Fincher and Uhls created a story packed with underlying themes and social commentary. From the whole consumerism theory to the more psychological component regarding Edward Norton’s mental state, every message is seamlessly communicated to the audience. I’ve also been through a point in my life where I wish I’d be someone else, someone who had already achieved every dream of mine successfully with an overwhelming feeling of fulfillment. Coping with the inability to become that perfect someone can become an excruciating, sad, depressing process, and it varies drastically from person to person.\r\n\r\nFight Club approaches mental health and people’s acceptance of who they truly are in a groundbreaking manner, capturing Edward Norton’s emotions perfectly and broadcasting his thoughts through some of the best narration in the history of cinema. Its take on the world of consumerism is undoubtedly interesting and plays a big part in the climax of the film. Despite the issues described above, Uhls’ screenplay is very well-written, elevating the conversations between Norton and Brad Pitt (Ad Astra, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), which are indeed remarkably entertaining. Predictable or not, the main story is wonderfully executed by Fincher, who continues to demonstrate his impressive technical attributes.\r\n\r\nOnce again, the pre-production phase is proved here to be as important as any other stage in the filmmaking process. Fincher’s dedication to his features is palpable and visible on-screen through every single technical aspect. This time, Fincher brought in Jeff Cronenweth as the director of photography, and both worked together to not only create that desaturated, realistic atmosphere that Fincher loves so much but also to deliver the brutal, violent, bloody fight scenes that keep the entertainment levels at their highest. With clean, consistent, coherent editing from James Haygood, the movie flows beautifully despite its lengthy runtime. The Dust Brothers’ score is quite alternative, which suits the also unconventional storytelling.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. I know it’s incredibly cliche to write that two actors share impeccable chemistry, but Norton and Pitt take it to a whole other level. In two physically-demanding displays, both actors deliver award-worthy performances that marked their careers. Pitt offers one of his most underrated portrayals, being extremely funny throughout the entire film, but also astonishingly badass, carrying his fight sequences as amazing as he does with his dialogues. On the other hand, seeing Norton go all-out is a terrific experience. I lack words to describe such an emotionally compelling interpretation, filled with powerful character moments. A final word of praise to Helena Bonham Carter (Enola Holmes), who also delivers an exceptional performance.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Fight Club is and will probably remain David Fincher’s most controversial movie for a long, long time. With an absolutely brilliant direction and execution, Fincher uses Jim Uhls’ captivating, layered, unconventional screenplay to tackle themes such as consumerism, society’s behavior, and mental health, seamlessly transmitting meaningful yet contentious messages. Once again, the filmmaking in display is technically flawless, going from the trademark authentic cinematography and production design to the unique score, all flowing superbly through excellent editing. Unfortunately, I don’t belong to the group of people who utterly love this film. The excessive (sometimes unnecessary) use of flashbacks doesn’t help, but it’s the enormous build-up packed with overly explicit clues to a significant (yet unsurprising) plot twist that ends up partially ruining the viewing for me. I also wish that the script developed a few plot points more ambiguously, but Brad Pitt and Edward Norton elevate the whole movie so much with their ridiculously outstanding performances that these small issues don’t keep me away from highly recommending one of the most memorable, iconic films of all-time.\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

I actually knew very little before viewing it, despite hearing about it on a surface level for years and years; well, one 'regulatory' part of it anyway. It's much deeper than I had expected. Unfortunately, I didn't find entertainment with any of it - it was, to be honest, a slog to sit through.\r\n\r\nThe only scene I can remember enjoying is the very last one, and I don't mean that negatively because the end shot is terrific. It's just everything that comes before didn't do anything for me. Yet, I still rate its intentions. It did keep me guessing amidst my, near, boredom and the 'event' is a good one on paper. It just failed to connect on me in actuality.\r\n\r\nBrad Pitt is good as Tyler, though the likes of Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter give meh performances in my opinion. Meat Loaf is interesting, I guess, as Bob.\r\n\r\nI'm evidently in the extreme minority with my thoughts, each to their own, but I honestly didn't get into it sadly. As noted, though, I still partially rate it weirdly. 6* feels harsh, so I give it 7*.",

  "content": "_**Finding enlightenment thru beating each other to a pulp**_\r\n\r\nA 30 year-old man in Los Angeles works the office drudgery, but suffers insomnia (Edward Norton). He’s finally inspired by an unconventional woman he meets at support groups (Helena Bonham Carter) and, especially, a devil-may-care guy who lives on the outskirts of town (Brad Pitt). They start an underground club where men get together and vent their frustrations by beating the crap out of each other.\r\n\r\n\"Fight Club\" (1999) has a huge reputation as a stylish cult flick and is often ranked with the greatest films ever made. The first half is entertaining enough, both quirky and amusing; and I like the interesting themes explored: Escaping the maternal and material, being a slave to advertising, rebelling against life-stifling conformity, being a blind follower of a charismatic leader, finding your inner wild-man, Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Cool, the nature of lawless “revolutionaries” (which is too reminiscent of ANTIFA thugs), the struggle with homosexuality interpretation, etc. \r\n\r\nThat’s all highly commendable. Unfortunately, the second half isn’t compelling. I sat there bored and couldn’t wait for it to end. “Donnie Darko” (2001) had the same problem – promising set-up with clever ideas, but a tedious wrap-up. Meanwhile the twist that everyone gushes over is actually underwhelming and not very surprising, although it’s relatively interesting. \r\n\r\nMoreover, watching guys get radically beat up is only entertaining a couple times; after that it gets redundant. Speaking of which, how exactly does bare-knuckled fighting inspire or enlighten? Does it really help one’s life to have missing teeth, black eyes and other assorted injuries? Of course the movie doesn’t emphasize the long-lasting negative effects of regular brawling. Have you ever met a brawler, boxer or professional football player in his 50s with the perpetual aches & pains?\r\n\r\nCult flicks like “Pulp Fiction” (1994) deserve the praise and stand the test of time; this one disappoints mainly due to the curiously dull second half. But it's genius on the metaphorical level no doubt.\r\n\r\nThe film is overlong at 2 hours, 19 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-",

It’s very persuasive in its message about corporatism as it appeals directly to men’s natural instinct and rawness. It’s a very raw movie overall.\r\n\r\nMy only wish is that it could be longer. This movie SHOULD be 3 hours. But even then, it masterfully delivers an experience and segues beautifully into every scene, fulfilling every plot device and answering every question.

  "content": "I wonder just how much of this might have been inspired by the vivid imagination of Robert Louis Stevenson? Edward Norton narrates a story that's essentially about himself. He works nine-to-five, but can't sleep. He can't explain his insomnia and after a casual aside from his doctor - who refuses to prescribe him sedatives - he starts cruising evening support groups. That's when he meets two important people. The first is \"Bob\" (Meat Loaf) who has undergone some hormone therapy that inadvertently helps him cry. Now after a bit of hugging, that skill transfers to our storyteller and the weeping seems to help with the sleeping! Success... Next, he meets \"Marla\" (Helena Bonham Carter) who also spends her evening going from group to group. Her only illness is a penchant for free doughnuts and coffee. They sort of bond - and even agree to divvy up the groups so they don't clash! It's on a flight, though, that our friend finds his life profoundly altered. He sits next to the uber-confident soap maker \"Tyler Durden\" (Brad Pitt) who offers him an whole new take on life - especially when his condo inexplicably blows up and he finds himself living with his new friend in what looks like a glorified squat. \"Punch me\" requires his pal. He gets punched back and both now seem to thrive on the ensuing and rather brutal cycle of violence. Their relationship feeds off the beatings and swiftly they are recruiting other men to their \"Fight Club\". With shades of the bare-knuckled boxing of the 19th century, they are soon atop an ever-growing group of men who almost revere their leaders. It's here that the whole story heads a little off-piste as it becomes clear that there is a much more malevolent agenda being put together by the membership. \"Durden\" starts to freeze out his friend, and now feeling more and more isolated his mental state starts to worsen. Just what's going on? Who is who? Even \"Marly\" starts to think he's lost the plot. This film is an allegorists wet dream. Just about every aspect of the characters behaviour can be used to evaluate or demonstrate  choices, freedoms, rebellion, self-awareness - even love. It's not quite so difficult to guess what the denouement will deliver, but it's a journey filled with violence (who'd be Jared Leto?), but it's increasingly used more as if it were a steam valve for something much more psychologically demanding. It's got to be Norton's best effort yet and with Pitt charismatically vacillating between the sagely and the thoroughly evil, this is thought-provoking cinema that is certainly better to watch in a cinema if you can.",

  "content": "As a child, I remember catching David Lynch’s “Dune” on TV. I was too young to really understand the plot at the time, but I didn’t care, all I knew was that the worms were awesome. When I got a little older, I read the book for my first time. It was the first “adult” book I read on my own, and I was in love with it ever since. I read it many more times growing up, and when the miniseries came out, I watched and recorded it every night, then re-watched it time and time again. When “Children of Dune” aired, I again devoured it happily. In the case of the Lynch film, as I grew, I of course began to see more and more of the flaws, though I personally hold the “Spicediver Edit” in quite high esteem. That particular cut of the film manages to make the Lynch version into what is a genuinely good film, but still imperfect. The miniseries has, up until now, remained my preferred adaptation. Now we have a new adaptation: Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune”, and it certainly is quite different from the previous two versions in many ways, but is it good? Well, at least from my perspective, that answer is complicated. The short version is yes, it is a good film, but it’s not a great one.\r\n\r\n    The gist of the story is straightforward. Many, many millennia in the future, Paul, the son of the Duke Leto Atreides, finds himself and his family caught in plots of intrigue, and betrayal, after taking custody of a new and valuable planet. In order to survive, he finds that he will have to depend on the training of his mother, the Lady Jessica, the help of the planets local population, the fremen, and his growing awareness of a great, yet possibly terrible destiny that waits for him. \r\n\r\n    In reality though, the story is anything but. The novel is infamous for being “unadaptable” with its complex “plots within plots” storyline, along with its sheer size. There is simply too much going on in the story to make it easy to turn into a film, or even a series. The previous efforts have all brought different aspects of the novel to the forefront, and this new version is no different. In broad strokes, it is perhaps the most faithful to the novel in terms of themes, and it certainly emphasizes some aspects of the political commentary behind the novel, such as the missionaria protectiva, which was nowhere to be found in the Lynch film, and only really hinted at in the miniseries. They also spend a little more time focusing on the fremen and their sentiments toward off-worlders after living under the Harkonnen regime, but unfortunately, while it is nice to see these themes in the film, they are undercut by little development. In fact, the entire film suffers on that front. So much of the political context and scheming has been left out that the film as presented feels somehow empty. \r\n\r\n    Early in the film, it is established that the emperor considers the Duke Leto a threat due to his popularity, but never really explores too much beyond it. Even more strangely, the film establishes this, but then later makes it seem like they were never really certain about the fact that the emperor was involved in a key scene, unlike the book, where the Duke was fully aware that they were heading into a trap, and was attempting to outmaneuver his political opponents. The Baron Harkonnen is limited to a few admittedly atmospheric scenes where he more or less confirms the emperor is aiding him in their goal to destroy the Atreides line, but it is reduced to a few scant lines, the bare minimum necessary to understand the plot. This, unfortunately results in very shallow characterization, and the same problem runs throughout the film. Gurney Halleck, Thufir Hawat, and Doctor Yueh are all present, but each of them is only given a small handful of scenes, in which they only speak a few lines each, before they are forgotten to focus on Paul, or beautiful scenic shots. They never feel like fully realized characters in the film, more as brief supporting roles, whom are only present in order to fulfill their roles in the larger storyline. Thufir Hawat receives perhaps the worst treatment in this regard. Even the primary cast are not given a lot of development. We are given enough to know who they are, and a little of their personality, but nothing more. It seems strange, that the longest adaptation of the first half of the novel ever made should have less detail and character than either previous version. It does however, and it certainly hurts the film as a result. Long, moody shots are great, but only when they exist in addition with actual depth. The plot of the film has been streamlined to the point that it feels watered-down, and genuinely wastes the talents of its cast all stuck in roles that have been similarly effected. \r\n\r\n    There are also a few key scenes that actively go against things covered in the book. One scene features the Lady Jessica speaking of secretive matters regarding the bene gesserit sisterhood while sitting in the cockpit of an ornithopter right behind Thufir Hawat, whom would be easily able to hear everything she had just said. Another moment, involves the Reverend Mother Mohiam referring to Jessica as Leto’s “wife”, even though she would know full well that they aren’t married. Yet another moment involves that Shadout Mapes pulling out a crysknife to offer it to Jessica while out in the open, and Jessica is in the presence of guards. The Shadout later sheathes the knife unblooded, and those who have read the book will know why that choice does not work for the film, especially in the context of fremen later being shown cutting themselves before sheathing their knives. Of course, in any adaptation there will be liberties taken, and there are indeed more, but these three moments in particular certainly seem to stand out the most in regards to actively going against aspects of the original novel, and in doing so, hurt this film as an adaptation.\r\n\r\n    With that said, there were things I liked as well. As I have stated a number of times, the film is gorgeous. There are a couple of scenes that certainly seemed to be more “style over substances”, such as a shot of ships rising from the ocean for… no apparent reason, but man do they look beautiful. There is also a very real sense of scale in the film that I can freely admit neither previous version ever accomplished. As a result, there are a few scenes that do far better match their description in the book, and are glorious to watch.\r\n\r\n    I do really appreciate the way they portray the emperor, discussed, but never seen. A powerful force that can be felt looming in the background, his hand guiding everything happening. He is built up excellently, and I will be curious to see how well he is portrayed if we get a sequel. In the previous adaptations, he was prominently displayed and used to provide greater context for the politics of the story, but in the book, he is only ever seen in the end, and keeping book accurate in this case certainly works very well.\r\n\r\n    The film also features the most book accurate version of Paul’s growing prescience, hinting at possible outcomes rather than complete premonitions. The way it is executed is not necessarily without its flaws, or heavy-handedness in a couple of moments, but it works well. Similarly, we also get the story of the bull and Leto’s father for the first time, though the film attempts to make the bull symbolic in a manner I am not sure really works, or is earned.　Also notable is the death of a significant character finally matching their death in the novel. \r\n\r\n    I have also stated that the cast does a great job, and I stand by that. In the entire film, there is not a bad performance in the film. My only complaint would be with the portrayal of the Lady Jessica, who comes across as too emotional, presumably in an attempt to show her ability to shift from being upset to being entirely refined and composed in moments, but that is a matter of writing rather than performance. When it comes to the casting, I personally felt that many of the actors matched their roles well, in particular enjoying the casting of Duke Leto and the Baron. I did not however care much for the gender-swapping of Liet, which served no real purpose, especially when one considers how small the characters role was in this version of the film, though Sharon Duncan-Brewster did a good job with what she had. I also did not care for the casting of Rebecca Ferguson as Jessica. While she is a very good actress, she seemed to me a bit too “girl next door”, rather than the character from the novel that the Duke Leto notes “reintroduced regality into the Atreides line”. \r\n\r\n    When it comes to the score, I will admit that I was not certain how I would feel in regards to Hans Zimmer’s work on the film. The samples I had heard up until this point had been interesting, but I was not sure how it would work in terms of the film itself. I can say that it works well, though there are moments when it feels almost as watered-down as the plot itself. It never really allowed me to feel excited at any point, but it did match the tone of the film very well, and I can easily see myself turning it on whenever I clean my house in order to set a “mood” (Ha! See what I did there?). \r\n\r\n    In conclusion, despite my criticisms, I did enjoy the film. I think it works well enough to be understood, though there may be some moments where the average viewer could find themselves feeling confused. It certainly is a visual spectacle, but one undercut by excessive trimming of detail and world-building. I hope it is successful enough to warrant a sequel in order to finish the story, but I also find that I will not be upset if it does not. As adaptations go, this is no “The Lord of the Rings”. In the end, I have to rate this version of “Dune” closer to the original Lynch film, and maintain the miniseries as my favorite adaptation of an amazing novel.",

  "content": "I'll open by saying I am not a fan of Villeneuve. In fact, I think he's a hack whose only genuine talent is making stupid people falsely think they are actually quite smart. I am also a HUGE Dune fan. They have been my favourite series of books since I first discovered them as a teenager. So although I hoped for the best with this, I was expecting the worst. What I got was somewhere in the middle. It's an OK movie, not great, thankfully not terrible, but OK\r\n\r\nIt got some things right the 1984 Lynch version got wrong, but still somehow managed to get other stuff wrong (including stuff Lynch got right). It was also a surprise how much Villeneuve just lifted directly from the Lynch film, both visually and auditorily.\r\n\r\nThe wardrobe choices were a huge disappointment. If you didn't know the time setting, going just on the clothes in the new Dune you'd be forgiven for thinking it was set a mere forty or fifty years (if that) in the future rather than the twenty thousand years in the future when it's really set. The Lynch stillsuits look futuristic, unworldly, and something that really would keep you alive in the deep desert. The new desert wear looks like they are just going to go dirt biking for an hour or two in our present-day world.\r\n\r\nThe casting (completely ignoring the pointless gender swap) was good, However, with the exception of Paul, Chani, and Rabban the original casting was all better. But the original (apart from the odd decision to use the totally unsuited Kyle MacLachlan) was a masterclass in how to cast the perfect people for the role.\r\n\r\nAnyway, enough of the comparisons, This film is about the first two-thirds of the first novel. I always thought the story would be better told via a big-budget TV series (or even mini-series) rather than a standalone movie. I still think what they tried to cover here was too much for a single movie, but it was a step in the right direction.\r\n\r\nThe film mainly sticks to the book story but does make some needless changes, the most obvious of which being the changes made to both the gender and story of Liet Kynes, which in turn impacts the story of Chani. Most other changes are small and mainly insignificant though.\r\n\r\nThe film being filmed in Norway, Jordan, and Abu Dhabi looks fantastic and very well suited to the large screen. And it's clear a great deal of time, effort, and money was put into the sets that looked equally good as the places they were meant to be.\r\n\r\nThe acting was of a suitably high standard, but unfortunately, many of the Dune names and terms were horribly mispronounced. That and the Hans Zimmer fart that is played constantly throughout the soundtrack is likely to pull people out of their emersion in the movie.\r\n\r\nI was also somewhat surprised by what was left out, OK the source material is VERY dense and obviously some needed to be cut, but I don't really think it's made clear just how crucial melange is to the functioning of the empire and society as a whole. Also what (and why) mentats are is largely ignored, you may think that isn't overly important, but it is at the core of how many things are done in the Dune universe.\r\n\r\nOver all, it's not a bad movie. Despite its flaws, I still think the 1984 Lynch version is better though.",

Not exactly awesome. I didn’t like how they quickly killed off all the good guys except for Paul and his mom (okay, yeah that is definitely a spoiler). Plus I thought it weird that during the big battle scene we have awesome bombs and complex tracer missiles flying about, but on the ground we have merely well-choreographed hand-to-hand fighting with knives and swords. Couldn’t the folks who invented the missile come up with a pistol? Or am I being picky?",

  "content": "I read Frank Herbert's book, Dune, when I was in high school and really don't remember it much except that it was great and a little scary. At that age, I probably didn't get the subtext message.\r\n\r\nI never saw any movies of it so I decided to watch both the 1984 Dune by David Lynch and the 2021 Denis Villeneuve version sequentially. I'm going to talk about both of them here.\r\n\r\nThis may not be a popular opinion: Lynch's version is **brilliant** and the Villeneuve Dune is absolute **shit**. Here's why:\r\n\r\nFirst, is the Villeneuve Dune slick? Yes, absolutely. I should hope so considering it's nearly 40 years after Lynch did his, for crissake.\r\n\r\nAre the character's in David Lynch's version kitschy and over the top? Yes! That's one reason it's so much better! It's Sci Fi, duh! You watch Marvel movies and suspend disbelief for incredible, imaginary super powers? All of Lynch's characters are downright gritty and believable within this particular surreal fantasy.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the Lynch Dune, I had sympathy for nearly every character in the film. Even the villains caught my emotions. Paul Atreides character development was realistic and attractive.\r\n\r\nVilleneuve's characters? I felt like my neighbor came over and asked, \"Hey, can you come to watch my kid's junior high school play?\" \"Sure, Denis, just let me fill my 1-liter flask with tequila first.\"\r\n\r\nVilleneuve's characters were so damned flat and lifeless that they evoked NO emotional response whatsoever. Although I occasionally sit through a bad flick, I can't remember recently watching a movie as awful character-wise, as the 2021 Dune. If I were an actor on that set, I would be silently screaming. How does a director even do this?\r\n\r\nOh, and where's the creativity? It's 46 years since George Lucas founded Industrial Light & Magic, and Denis can't create one single, new, goddamn space machine 46 years later? (One could argue the hummingbird copter is new, but it's not so creative when you realize that we didn't even know how hummingbird wings actually worked until this millennia.)\r\n\r\nBut here's the real clincher: the screenplay. David Lynch gave us a complete story. Sadly, he didn't have the final cut and disowned his film when the critics panned it. Despite the fact that Lynch is a true artist and genius, the studio took 45 minutes out of the film. 45 minutes! Even ruined by the studio, even 40 years later, Lynch's film has a clear vision and carries the timeless message that Frank Herbert intended. I would LOVE to see the original cut!\r\n\r\nVilleneuve, on the other hand, stopped abruptly in the middle of the book. I now realize that Denis is not about the story. Denis is all about the franchise money, and that sucks. As a result of the bad screenplay, this 2021 version doesn't even carry the socio-political statement it was supposed to have. I want my 155 minutes back.\r\n\r\nI don't watch Part 2s, especially when it comes to void-of-creativity and void-of-character-development Hollywood movies. You can take your bad franchise and shove it up your sci fi black hole.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, I loved Blade Runner 2049, but this is so disappointing, I may never watch another Villeneuve film again. Do yourself a favor and see David Lynch's version of Dune.",

I can't say this was at all bad and have some mild interest in part two, but, and this says a lot about Villeneuve's great career, this is one of his lesser films.

  "content": "I was really eager to watch this movie and at the same time a wee bit concerned because I knew that I would be hugely disappointed if it turned out to be another movie massacring a classic source material.\r\n\r\nI have to admit that it was a very long time since I read the Dune books but I have to say that the movie was mostly true to the books, as I remember them, and also reasonably free of agenda driven rubbish apart from the odd replacement of some characters with “gender correct” ones for no real good reason.\r\n\r\nThere is really not much point in me saying much about the story. It should be well known for any science fiction fan and it is a great story and really good material for a big screen movie despite some “critics” at Rotten Tomatoes moaning about it and calling it unwieldly etc. Probably too big a book with too many words for the small, agenda driven, brains of Rotten Tomatoes “critics”. No surprise there.\r\n\r\nThe movie as a whole is wonderful to watch, the scenery is oftentimes very beautiful and the décor, the buildings, the machinery is very well done. I was surprised that the world of Caladan was portrayed as a rather austere Scottish looking landscape but after getting over the initial surprise it worked very well actually.\r\n\r\nI also like that the Harkonnen, especially the Baron, are not turned into some exaggerated comical figures but, although disgusting and despicable, they are actual humans.\r\n\r\nOverall the casting was quite good and everyone played their roles well. At the beginning I felt that Paul was a bit too wimpy, from what I remember of the book he was quite well trained and skilled already from the start, but he picked up as the movie went along.\r\n\r\nIt is a science fiction, borderline fantasy, movie so there should be some special effects, right? This is a difficult movie to make special effects for since this universe is a weird mix between futuristic science fiction, fantasy elements and old-fashioned traditions.\r\n\r\nI have to say that they succeeded quite well though. The atmosphere felt just right, ships, spice harvesters, buildings looked cool and fitting the story. The way they implemented the personal shields was very nice. They didn’t go overboard on special effects and weird designs. The ornithopter was of course totally ridiculous from a scientific point of view but at least it looked pretty cool.\r\n\r\nIf I should complain about something, although that is not the fault of the movie but of the source material, I have never understood how, in a universe which is obviously driven by hidden agendas, machinations and assassinations, the Atreides could just pick up everything, leave their home and put all their important eggs in one basket at Arrakis.\r\n\r\nOne more small thing that I could complain about would of course be that we now have to wait two years, from what I have read, until we get to watch the next movie to get to the part were the really cool stuff happens.\r\n\r\nBottom line, this was movie is definitely in there vying for the title “best movie that I have watched this year”.",

He's ferocious, hilarious, out of his mind, and flat out brilliant.<br>\r\n     The supporting players are tops as well. I was somewhat baffled when Jonah Hill earned a nominee for Moneyball, but this time around he rightfully deserves this years nominations. With his pearly white teeth, charisma, while also throwing himself into the role with no fear, this is without a doubt his greatest work as an actor to date. The real find, however, is Margot Robbie. Strikingly beautiful, her character could have been one note, but she also hits the ball out of the court. Even Matthew Macconaughey steals the show with only one scene. <br>\r\n     Dangerously funny, superbly edited, and with a delicious, irreverent, savage bite. The Wolf of Wall Street is Scorsese at his wildest. And it goes without saying, that this is one of the best films of last year. Just stay away if you are in any way a prude or conservative. \r\n     Rated R- Graphic nudity, strong sexual content, drug use throughout, pervasive language, and some violence.",

  "content": "**Voracious Bull**\r\n\r\nEvery time I try to enjoy a Martin Scorcese movie post-1980 I ask myself what made _Raging Bull_ so great? Did Marty burn out after his Jake LaMotta bio, the same way Coppola did after _Apocalypse Now_? These were risky movies, driven by passion, bordering on madness. Did Marty and Francis lose their natural passion for making films because industry priorities dismissed 70's-style hyper-realism for sensational summer blockbusters and CGI spectacles? And why is Scorcese considered one of the greatest director when he really only made one truly superb movie?\r\n\r\nWhen I first saw _Raging Bull_ in 1980 I immediately knew I was watching something that transcended the typical cinematic experience. Genius was shimmering out of every perforated frame flickering on the screen. Paul, Marty, Bobby, Mike and Thelma created something that was completely absorbing. The style and substance was perfectly fueled by a flawless emotional narrative. Every element was orchestrated just right. The audience was spellbound. We were watching greatness. A rare and unique organic creation. I'm still waiting for Robert Redford to correct a travesty of justice and hand his Ocscar over to it's rightful owner. And I'm still waiting for Scorcese to match his own brilliance. But that's like expecting Tarantino to top _Pulp Fiction_. There's a better chance Orson Welles rises up from the dead to one up _Citizen Kane_. \r\n\r\nAfter _Raging Bull_, Scorcese has made a string of pictures ranging from not bad to pretty good. All well-made, thoughtful and meticulously crafted films, but nothing special; certainly nothing profound. Contrary to popular opinion, _Goodfellas_ is not a great movie. I was not swept away by the saga. I was annoyed rather by the fragmented non-stop soundtrack and incessant up-tempo style. Marty wasn't risking anything anymore. He seemed to be afraid of boring the audience. Perhaps he was trying to revive the 1940's never-let-up screwball-bouncing farcical Preston Sturges and co. comedies. But this is a mafia film. This should have been right up Marty's alley. It's been almost a quarter of a century since De Niro got his face busted in a boxing ring. Since the raw, robust and naive will-power of LaMotta's youth plunged into the pathetic, brutal, bone-headed stupidity of his later years. Similarly, Scorsese hasn't registered a knock-out punch since. Would his ensuing movies be considered great if someone else directed them? Would I have liked them all better if Raging Bull had never been made?\r\n\r\n_The Wolf of Wall Street_ is another exhausting affair. It tries too hard to excite and entertain us. It's afraid of slowing down, allowing us to ponder or examine the complexities of excessive greed, shameless wealth and unbridled capitalism. It desperately wants to arouse us. Like a neglected clown at a child's birthday trying to be loved and taken seriously while draining the life out of the party. Give Leo and Jonah an \"A\" for effort. They couldn't have tried harder if they broke out into song and dance every ten minutes. And they convincingly appeared to enjoy themselves freely indulging in coke, ludes and naked women every five minutes. It was nice of Leo to step back while Margot Robbie took her routine and obligatory, supporting-actress hissy fit. And you know a filmmaker has a lot of faith and confidence in his work when a superfluous narration track is added, to plug those terrifying noiseless gaps. Whatever happened to poignant, suspenseful, sure-footed, gripping, emotionally-arresting dramas that take you on a nervy, wild ride to a thoroughly gratifying climax? A truly great director from Kurosowa to, well, Scorcese-(circa 1979) would have plotted the rise and fall of a maniacal protagonist along deeper and more affecting lines even at the risk boring its audience for one minute.",

It's absolutely nuts, and I mean that in a positive way.\r\n\r\nLeonardo DiCaprio simply never puts an acting foot wrong, this is the sixth film I've seen of his and I love <em>(fwiw: all 9/10+)</em> them all. Phenomenal actor! He is outstanding here as Jordan Belfort, the guy this film is based upon. As noted, I didn't really ever care for Jordan but DiCaprio makes it impossible not to enjoy watching events throughout.\r\n\r\nJonah Hill (Donnie) comes in with a very good performance, the type of which I hadn't previously seen from him; closest being, in terms of quality, <em>'Moneyball'</em>. Margot Robbie, meanwhile, isn't easy to forget as Naomi. Though none of the following standout big, it's pleasant to see Jon Bernthal, Matthew McConaughey and Jon Favreau, among others, appear.\r\n\r\nThe almost three hour run time, aside from a couple of moments, goes by fairly quickly. A big reason for that is the sheer bonkers nature of the plot, which goes in so many different directions it's impressive. It doesn't, as I've already mentioned, breed likeability for the characters but I definitely had a fun time watching it all unfold. I guess it depends on what you, as a viewer, prefer. I got the desired amount of entertainment.",

  "content": "This is based on a book telling the true story of a man who saw an opportunity to con his way to a $1 million a week job fleecing would-be investors and capitalising on that one human vice that most permeates society. Greed. Initially thumped by a financial crisis, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) is reduced to joining a ramshackle school of amateur brokers selling penny stocks and hoping that enough of those will make enough commission to live on. Quickly, he realises the truth to that old expression about every penny making a pound, though - or in this case, a buck. He quickly galvanises this team into an affective trading force that is soon seemingly making money from thin air. Give their business an old-school name to establish some market credibility and the sky’s the limit? For years it was, as this man and his friends creamed the system at will, making a fortune to spend on drugs, hookers, houses, cars, yachts - you name it. These guys knew how to play the game and how to act with impunity whilst the Feds flapped around at their ankles trying to prove that any of this was unlawful. Of course, the more they got the more they wanted. The more they got away with, the more invulnerable they felt - and fairly soon their tentacles were spreading across Europe too. Sooner or later, their chickens must come home to roost, or should that be roast? Or will they? What’s clear from Scorsese’s rather savage and occasionally pithy indictment of profiteering capitalism is that these men don’t think they are ever going to be caught or, indeed, that they are doing anything wrong. Just like the early boxers who fought their way out of poverty, these guys started off wanting for things as basic as an home, or an education for their kids, or healthcare for their parents. What harm in improving yourself? It’s not real money, so it can’t impact on real people? What struck me about this, after about half an hour, is that once we got the point about these selfish and hedonistic folks living a life of profligate excess, the characterisations don’t really go anywhere. We watch them descend into a selfish, pill-induced, maelstrom, but once we have heard the first rousing, expletive-laden, speech from Belfort extolling the virtues of their aspirations, it didn’t need to continually reinforce the odiousness of what I was watching. We get it. He’s a venal and obnoxious individual blessed with the same thing that Hitler and Mussolini were - charisma. He could sell sand in the desert by fist-pumping the air and smiling at his all too eager and gullible employees and investors alike who wanted to make a quick dollar without asking too many questions. That is the aspect of this that I would have found more interesting to explore. Why are they so successful? Who are the people of all incomes, shapes and sizes, who are investing $25 and expect to get it back ten fold without risk or without penalty? We never see any of these something-for-nothing merchants who are every bit as greedy as the Belforts of this world. If these boys could milk things so effectively why the hell can’t governments make money like this for everyone’s benefit? These guys are no Nobel economics laureates, just psyched-up cheats and losers. Despite being pretty unlikeable, there is something potently appreciable about DiCaprio’s delivery of his foul-mouthed character here. Success goes to his head, his wife loves the trappings without enquiring too deeply and they live in a bubble that is as likely to illicit envy as it is disgust from folks who might loathe the idea, but who might not behave so very differently if presented with the same opportunity. This film disappointingly focuses on the shameful profligacy and the low hanging fruit of these people, and it’s a compelling enough watch for the most part, but as an evaluation of cause and effect I though it under-delivered and took an easy route of sensationalism. Good film, though.",

While Harry also acquires a rather helpful book written by the mysterious Half-Blood Prince.\r\n\r\nPotter 6 is not as dark as the pre-release chattings suggested it would be. Yes there's the usual dark moments, including a shattering turn of events that sets it up nicely for the finale, but this instalment is mostly fun, gentle and even sexy. Harry, Ron & Hermione are more under threat from their own adolescent urges than they are from the swirl of a Death Eater or the appearance of one young & creepy Tom Riddle. This of course makes for good viewing to most of us who have grown with the characters, with the principal young actors having nicely grown into said characters. But can it sustain a two and half hour running time? No it can't is the ass numbingly honest answer. There's some quality set-pieces including Quiddich (for a change) and a swamp attack by the Death Eaters, but by and large it's talky and breezy in equal measure.\r\n\r\nA filler Potter movie then, one that is far breezier than expected. Good but not great, but as a set up for the epic conclusion it hits all the right buttons. 6/10",

  "content": "The seventh installment, the appetiser.\r\n\r\nAs the ultimate wizarding battle between good and evil draws ever closer, Harry, Hermione and Ron bunk off from Hogwarts to go search for the \"Horcruxes\" with which to halt the ever stronger Voldermort and his army, on the way they learn the importance of the Deathly Hallows artifacts.\r\n\r\nSo this is the one that sees the comfort confines of Hogwarts left behind as our intrepid trio of best pals hit the mountains and forests in search of the tools to stop old snake face in his tracks. In what is ultimately a chase/escape movie, one where the characters have to fight not only a number of challenges that come their way, but also their new found in-fighting capabilities, Deathly Hallows 1 wonderfully dangles the carrot for the final series entry to come. But the overriding thoughts you come away with from it is that firstly it's not really that much fun, and secondly that it shouldn't have been a stand alone movie. Too much of it plods where exposition and padding strains to get the film through its near two and half hour running time. Without the hustle and bustle of Hogwarts, and the myriad of characters that reside within, film struggles to escape the over reliance on just three central characters and a ream of MacGuffins. While some of the comedy and tender moments fall flat because tone is firmly pitched at dark clouds a gathering. However, where it does reward is with the action sequences, with David Yates once again proving he's a considerable talent when it comes to directing such passages.\r\n\r\nNew additions to the cast list feature Rhys Ifans, Peter Mulan and Bill Nighy, all welcome, and all sadly underused. As is the return of some older characters from earlier series entries (do you remember John Hurt was in the first film?!). While the thread involving the Ministry of Magic, and its nasty transformation into a Nazi like call for non-magical folk ethnic cleansing, is supremely adult and hits the nerves as it should do. Of the three principal young adult actors, it's still Emma Watson leading the way on ability, but alongside her, Radcliffe and Grint have earned our love and respect over the years for having to carry the weight of such expectation that has come with these roles. Fact is, is that now, having grown up with them and their characters for over ten years, we surely can accept them for not being multi ranged child actors. They have had to embody one character each for a decade, the range as such is the naturalism of aging through childhood like they have. Job done!\r\n\r\nTension is high and the magical moments engage big time, but the draggy nature of the beast makes this a film purely working as an appetiser to something sure to be far bigger and better. 6/10",

  "content": "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince may be the most mature film of the franchise with fantastic character development, but at the cost of action and a somewhat slow pace.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the film suffers from what a lot of these films do where the audience is taken from location to location, without any explanation as to why. It is difficult to follow at times, but it's a sacrifice that unfortunately has to be made when adapting a long novel into a feature-length film. Despite this film being the slowest of the series, it does a tremendous amount of leg work setting up the epic conclusion. From the introduction of the Horcruxes to the multiple scenes of Voldemort's past, the audience gets a ton of background information revealing details from the previous film that creates a more coherent story structure.\r\n\r\nHalf-Blood Prince has a more focused return to Hogwarts and the class aspect which I enjoyed. Jim Broadbent's Professor Horace was a great addition and his connection with Potter is so seamless, with some aid from the Half-Blood Prince's textbook. Not only does Harry have great chemistry with Professor Horace, but his relationship with Dumbledore blossoms, and his reverence for the headmaster is captivating. It was great to see these two finally working together and trusting each other. Previously Harry would always hold information or Dumbledore would tell Harry to never mind, but finally, they get on the same page, and it was great to see.\r\n\r\nThis connection aids tremendously in the final scenes of the film. The trials that these two characters are put through are immense, but Harry's trust in Dumbledore is shown in a very uncomfortable scene of Dumbledore forcing down a poison of some sort. This struggle crescendos into an incredibly impactful finale with Dumbledore, unfortunately, dying at the hands of Snape. There were some fantastic character moments between Snape and Malfoy, and the light inside both of them is hinted at in this final scene. Dumbledore's death is felt, not only by the students of Hogwarts but by the audience as well. This is one of the more effective deaths in the series due to the audience's time with the character, as opposed to the death of Sirius Black in the previous film.\r\n\r\nOverall, this movie is slow and can drag on a bit. But there are some great character moments and plot developments that make this a fantastic beginning of the end for the series.\r\n\r\nScore: 84%\r\nVerdict Great",

The salvation of mankind is going to rest with a generation of hunters. These are rated S-E, with E being the most junior in terms of experience and skill. That's how we meet the young \"Sung Jinwoo\". He's a relative novice who is also broke. He can't even pay the rent, so accepts a task joining a team who are entering a dungeon that's only been deemed safe for \"C\" level hunters. Pretty swiftly he realises that he's being manipulated by his so-called partners and faces an enormous great beastie that looks something like a red-eyed woodlouse. Only by pushing himself to the limit, can he hope to defeat it. This is when he discovers that by levelling up he gains more power, more resilience, weaponry, agility (and becomes considerably better looking!) - and that's the start of a series of well-drawn and lively animations illustrating his increasingly difficult battles to ascend the ranks of hunters earning friends and enmity as he goes. It's quickly paced and more characterful than many of the action animé series, this one, with loads of action right from the start. Though it does inter-twine the fantasy adventures with a bit of the human-side activity, most of this is staged within the confines of a game that presents a range of adventures that are exciting to watch. Jeopardy? Well, no, not really. It's all clearly building to a denouement that isn't going to be included in this amalgamated three-episode feature, but as stepping stones along the way it's also a bit more stand alone than some of the cinematic partial-serialisations that we see. On the downside, it does rely on quite a lot of onscreen textual information that isn't always the easiest to read when fleetingly put onto a big screen, but the escapades with the likes of a deadly red knights and some menacing ice bears help this to flow quite entertainingly.",

It's fantastic cinema, with captivating visual effects, characterisations and a much more mature storyline that deals with both triumph and disaster using a superb ensemble cast drawn from amongst the best actors who all contribute to build a real sense of unity and jeopardy ahead of part 2....

It's retirement time for his head of security \"Cal\" (Johnson) so he's not best pleased after hundreds of years - and working with \"Zoe\" (Lucy Lui) he has to find out just how his boss's security was compromised in the first place - and then get to the rescuing bit. That search leads them to tech whizz \"Jack\" (Chris Evans) but he hadn't any idea whom his client actually was. After a rocky start, the two men must pull their resources and save Santa before Christmas really does start to deal with all of us on the naughty list. It's got bits of \"Elf\" in it, mingled with some \"Harry Potter\" elements and to be fair to all concerned, they all look like they are having some fun amidst a surfeit of CGI and very tightly choreographed action scenes that mix the modern and the mythological entertainingly enough. Simmons and Liu don't really feature so much and the moral of good vs evil isn't lost in the delivery but it isn't laboured either. Perhaps it's not a movie you will ever remember seeing, but as far as it goes it's a fun vehicle for it's stars to cheer us up as the festivities approach without too much sentiment or cheese.",

Simmons, Kiernan Shipka, Chris Evans, and Dwayne Johnson, brings a decent level of chemistry to the screen, which is one of the movie's few strengths. While the actors clearly enjoy playing off each other, the story itself is expectedly generic, relying heavily on predictable holiday tropes. The script fails to inject enough fun to offset its cliché formulas, and despite its festive intentions, the film feels stuck in cruise control, never quite capturing the magic or excitement one might hope for from a Christmas blockbuster.\r\n\r\nTechnically, RED ONE falters with its visuals. Almost every scene feels confined to a studio setting, and inconsistent VFX work makes it difficult to stay immersed in the story. The action sequences, though admittedly frequent, are mostly dimly lit, which diminishes any potential impact they might have had. None of these set pieces stand out, leaving viewers with little to savor beyond the familiar faces on screen. While it's not as terrible as some have claimed, Jake Kasdan ultimately delivers just another forgettable holiday flick, weighed down by formulaic storytelling and overshadowed - quite literally - by its murky, dark aesthetic.\r\n\r\nRating: C-",

Johnson is a bit more serious than usual and I liked that, while Evans' character ends up being the heart of the movie. J. K.

Lucy Liu is underused, mind. Bonnie Hunt too, I guess. I can't really fault anyone from the cast though, they all do solid work. If I'm honest, I don't see this film having much of a lifespan in the old memory bank but, nevertheless, I'd still classify it as something worth viewing.",

The cinematography, sadly, doesn't help either, with over-reliance on weak CGI and clumsy action sequences that fail to impress.\r\n\r\nUltimately, \"Red One\" lacks the holiday magic or the action-packed excitement it promised.

  "content": "Telling the story of a larger-than-life individual truly calls for a larger-than-life film, and that’s precisely what writer-director Christopher Nolan has come up with in his latest feature outing, handily the best work of his career. Nolan’s three-hour opus about the life of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), director of the Manhattan Project (and more commonly known as the Father of the Atomic Bomb), provides viewers with a comprehensive biography of this brilliant and thoughtful yet often-inscrutable and naïve physicist who took on a patently dangerous venture that left him morally conflicted about the nature of his creation. The story, which spans several decades of the scientist’s life, chronicles his development of “the gadget” and the fallout he suffered as a consequence of his left-wing political leanings and his efforts to keep the released nuclear genie from getting out of control. The film is admittedly a little overlong and probably could have used some editing in the opening and final hour, but, in the interest of telling the whole story of Oppenheimer’s odyssey, its length is understandable (and, consequently, justifiable). The picture’s production values are all top shelf, especially its brilliant cinematography, stirring original score and superb sound quality, an element that truly leaves audiences with a bona fide visceral experience. Moreover, the narrative is skillfully and eloquently brought to life by this offering’s outstanding ensemble cast, including Murphy, Matt Damon, Tom Conti, Benny Safdie, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Gary Oldman, Rami Malek, and, especially, Robert Downey Jr., who delivers a stellar, award-worthy supporting performance showing acting chops that I never knew he possessed. “Oppenheimer” is easily the best film of the summer movie season, if not all of 2023 thus far. It packs a potent punch and delivers a message that we can all never hear too often, poignantly reminding us all of the importance of not falling prey to the same Promethean burden that Oppenheimer was forced to shoulder.",

  "content": "Cillian Murphy offers an assured and considered performance here as the man who is credited with developing the bomb that hastened the end of WWII in the far east. He is the increasingly acclaimed, eponymous, physicist who is made aware by Admiral Lewis Strauss (another strong performance from Robert Downey Jr.) that it just possible that the Russians have the A-bomb. Now Oppenheimer already suspects that the Nazis are also well on their way to weaponising the atom - his earlier education and career had introduced him to some of the prominent minds in the UK and in Germany who were quite capable of taking the theory forward; so he begins to pressurise the American government to begin it's own programme - and the \"Manhattan Project\" is born. Motivated/goaded/galvanised by the ambitious \"Col. Groves\" (Matt Damon) he assembles a formidable collection of scientific minds at a purpose built, desert, location which he christens Los Alamos, and over the next three years - and with $2bn to spend - they work on the science whilst plutonium and uranium are being simultaneously processed at an irkingly glacial pace! Given that much of this is reasonably well documented history, the actual plot here has little by way of jeopardy. Instead, Christopher Nolan attempts via his writing and direction to put some meat on the bones of the characters here. It's clear that Oppenheimer is a bit of a Lothario, but it's also clear that he can engender the loyalty of a variety of people with diverging views - not just surrounding the science of their project, but around the morals and ethics of creating something that - well, you can't get the toothpaste back into the tube. The latter portion of this drama focusses on the subsequent, communist-obsessed, witch-hunting that went on attempting to persecute and smear this remarkable and flawed individual, and it makes some interesting postulations about just who was pulling whose strings. It also has quite a penetrating resonation about it - not just, specifically, about Oppeneheimer - but about all of those post-event \"enquiries\" that rarely deliver an honest appraisal of what was done in the name of expediency at the time, but ends up more of a character assassination exercise by those who didn't do anything against those who did and had to. Though at times the pace of this thing helps to keep it enthralling, it is too long - at times it really does plod along. Perhaps an other, objective, eye on the writing/direction may have tightened it up without having to sacrifice any of the potency of the story. Maybe someone needs to tell Mr. Nolan that a three hour film isn't always required! That said, it's a gorgeous film to look at. The aesthetics are first rate and the entire sentiment of the film reeks of authenticity. I do think this thrives better on a big screen so try to see it as it was intended. It's though provoking, complex, characterful - and well worth a watch.",

  "content": "The intersection of innovation, science, political bureaucracy, and ethics meet in writer-director Christopher Nolan‘s “Oppenheimer,” a dark, challenging biopic about the father of the atomic bomb, Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer. This profound epic clocks in at three hours yet never feels too long, even if it’s painfully clear that Nolan is indulging himself in a passion project.\r\n\r\nDuring World War II, Lt. General Leslie Groves Jr. (Matt Damon) appoints physicist Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Assembling a team of the brightest scientists the country has to offer, the experts spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. When their final product is used against Japan on July 16, 1945, the world witnesses its first nuclear explosion in an event that not only ends the war, but forever changes the course of history.\r\n\r\nThere has been much hype about the fact that Nolan chose to film in IMAX, but the large format feels wasted here. The visuals are far from stunning, and the film is mostly a dramatic, dialogue-heavy history lesson that’s a far cry from what I’d call “entertaining.” It’s a great movie that’s engaging, sophisticated, and intelligent, but those expecting traditional thrills are going to be greatly disappointed. Save your money, because seeing this in IMAX isn’t really worth it.\r\n\r\nNolan’s film is poignant in a way that’s chillingly relevant. His story not only explores one of the most important figures in U.S. history, but also makes you think about the current lack of empathy that’s plaguing society. There’s a very real moral question about humanity’s ability to make something that will help save the lives of many but also result in the death of innocents, and Nolan makes a strong political statement in a surprisingly restrained manner. His commentary on the far-reaching effects of such a powerful weapon born from the intersection of innovation, science, and government, while being an invention that has changed but also endangered the world, will give you chills. Nolan’s script is terrific, and is one of my favorite screenplays of the year.\r\n\r\nNolan tells much more of the obscure back story of Oppenheimer’s professional and personal life that few know, and it makes for a lengthy (but interesting) narrative. The film includes his ties to the Communist Party, Hoover’s FBI investigation, his tangles with Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), and an eventual closed-door hearing that was designed to strip him of his security clearance years after the war ended.\r\n\r\n“Oppenheimer” is a complex film that requires your full attention, with myriad characters and time jumps that will keep you on your toes. A basic knowledge of history is beneficial, but those who have only heard the name Robert Oppenheimer and are aware of the very basics (like the fact that he was involved in the creation of the atomic bomb) won’t be completely lost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to complicated discussions of quantum physics, there are weighty themes about the dangers of government bureaucracy and the moral and ethical implications of creating a weapon of mass destruction. Nolan isn’t the type of storyteller who is keen on hand holding, and it’s refreshing to see a riveting movie that’s made for thinking audiences.",

  "content": "> **Oppenheimer:** I feel like I have blood on my hands, sir.\r\n> \r\n> **Truman:** [takes a handkerchief from his pocket and gives it to him] You think anyone in Hiroshima or Nagasaki gives a shit about who built the bomb?\r\n\r\nan incredibly well-written and extremely well-acted piece of dramatic cinema about the very eventful and complicated life of J. Robert Oppenheimer and it is beautiful. I'm actually surprised this is a huge summer blockbuster.\r\n\r\nanytime Christopher Nolan releases a film, it's obviously an event all around the world because he's made tons of great films and he's one of the very few film-makers working today who really cares about cinema and values that cinematic experience. he's also one of the very few people who's actually given a budget to support his love for cinema. he shoots on film, does everything practically, he wants as little CGI as possible and he has apparently claimed that there isn't a single CGI shot in this film. if that's actually the case, like if he hasn't even included cleanup shots in the film, then my spirit just left my body. it's astounding.\r\n\r\nwent into this film with very limited knowledge about the life of Oppenheimer. like most people, I only knew him as The Father of the Atomic Bomb and the famous lines he quoted from the Bhagavad Gita which are Now I Am Become Death, The Destroyer of Worlds where he's talking about the atomic bomb realising the gravity of his creation and having to live with the sin of his achievement. I had no other knowledge about him as a person, his life outside of the invention, and the events that followed before or after it. so, if you're going into this film expecting an explosion porn, you're most likely to get disappointed having to sit through 3 hours' worth of heavy dramatic dialogue involving moments of genuinely terrifying character development. the film is about the person whose most pivotal moment in life was the success of The Manhattan Project. getting to experience being inside that person's mind as he's trying to visualize all these things combined with an incredible score by Ludwig Göransson and watching all of these rated-R, 3-hour, dialogue-heavy, beautifully shot on film by the master himself Hoyte van Hoytema with black and white sequences in a fucking theatre made me feel like I wasn't in 2023.\r\n\r\nthe performances are excellent. there really is no other word for it. from the top all the way down to the bottom of the incredibly huge cast list, there isn't a single weak link. Robert Downey Jr. is simply terrific. I haven't seen him like this since Kiss Kiss Bang Bang which came all the way back in 2005. I love him as Iron Man but that's more about the character rather than him as an actor. I wouldn't be shocked if he's nominated for a best supporting actor performance. Emily Blunt is also just really really great. there is a sequence early on in the film where Oppenheimer is being questioned and she's just sitting back there in the scene, out of focus. we're not even shown a close-up of her during this entire sequence until it becomes relevant later on in the film and we go back to that sequence when we finally realise the significance of her being there. Nolan has done quite a lot of that in this film actually. major A-list actors are in the film for like 2 scenes and then they never appear again. that's not just a testament to the actors who'd give anything to be in a Nolan-directed film but a testament to Nolan himself, as a film-maker. if we go back to the same sequence I mentioned earlier with Blunt, that's not just anyone sitting there, it's Emily Blunt. a phenomenal actress. but that's what gives the film a sense of groundedness. that the people on-screen are actual people, they behave like people. and for a certain amount of time, allows those celebrities to feel like normal people. Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Rami Malek, Jason Clarke, Dane DeHaan, I can go on and on but literally everyone is fucking phenomenal. the real star of the show though, is Cillian Murphy. in his first lead role for a Nolan film after having worked with him for almost 20 years, Murphy shines brighter than the atomic bomb itself and walks with suave leaving not just two, but a multitude of shockwaves. his work is beyond phenomenal here. he not only looks like Oppenheimer but every scene he's in, he's just instantly captivating. it's not just his incredible eyes (which go so deep that I just wanna sink myself in them) but, he's just always in character. never did I once see the guy from Red Eye or from Peaky Blinders. it was always Oppie.\r\n\r\nI'm actually putting this review as I listen to the absolutely bonkers score that has been provided for the film. Göransson's work is truly, awesome-tacularly, riveting. my heart was beating so fast in some sequences that have this heavy, beating sounds that I could almost have a seizure. the work here is truly remarkable.\r\n\r\nanother aspect of this film that shines brighter than ever is its editing. this is a 3-hour film that feels like 2 and a half. a half-an-hour of time just evaporated for me. every scene ends perfectly. there is no room for baggage. several big moments of history fly away in an instant. this gives the film a really focused feel. it gives the audience a cue that this is not the story of the world but it is the story of Oppenheimer. Nolan really knows how to edit his films such that they have just the right runtime and I really appreciate when a film-maker does that. it very much also gives this film that documentary-esque aspect and gets you convinced that these events actually did happen and this is not just some made-up story about a man's life.\r\n\r\nthis film is truly a marvelous achievement not just for Christopher Nolan himself as a filmmaker but for cinema as a whole. peak dramatic cinema. watch this on the biggest screen possible and the loudest speakers you can find.",

  "content": "# A well-made live-action adaptation\r\n\r\nThe Korean film «Omniscient Reader: The Prophecy» («전지적 독자 시점») is an adaptation based on the still-ongoing Korean webtoon «Omniscient Reader» which itself is based on a Korean novel of the same name. (That was a long sentence!)\r\n\r\nWhile many gave it a low rating and were not satisfied, I was very satisfied and gave it a perfect 10 ⭐. Here's why:\r\n\r\n1. It's an adaptation of a very long and still on-going serial novel and webtoon.\r\n2. Adaptation writers have literary freedom on how to adapt a work of art in a differeet medium and target audience.\r\n3. Like it or not: budget constraints.\r\n\r\nMost, if not all, who gave it a low score expected it will cover beyond the plot in the movie. It just is not possible. And if they dod that, they will have to skip a lot of critical moments of the story which will also earn far more negative reviews than what it received for this release.\r\n\r\nThe acting were good. The choice of actors were generally who one would have imagined while reading the novel or the webtoon. I'm not saying I agreed with all the casting but they did well for their respective roles.\r\n\r\nThe special effects and CG passed. It wasn't perfect, there were fight scenes were the different layers (real layer, green/digital layer) were not smooth nor clean, and were obvious. They need to improve their technique and technology if they plan on making a sequel.\r\n\r\nThe chosen parts of the story, I approve of it as well.\r\n\r\nLast but one of the most complained about, I also approve of the obvious changes. It fits the film format, and the essence of this \"chapter\" of the story were maintained as it was in the original source material. That is the most important on adaptations. It is not about incorporating every scene, or having the exact likeness for the characters, or making sure the sequence of events remain exactly the same. No, that is just wrong in adaptations. What matters is keeping the essence of it. The feels. The aura. The message. What made the original material popular. That's what a real adaptation is.\r\n\r\nA perfect 10 ⭐. Now, where's the sequel? The next \"chapter\" is one of my favourites.",

My interest did wane slightly at roughly the middle part, as was similarly the case with the first film in truth, but that was a feeling that only lasted for a relativiely short time.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it's fantastic. The acting is top notch, the visuals are breathtaking <em>(those sandworms tho)</em> and the score is outstandingly hefty - you can always rely on the great Hans Zimmer! Timothée Chalamet stars yet again, as do the likes of Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya, Dave Bautista & Co. The person I actually enjoyed most on screen was Javier Bardem, who is truly brilliant throughout. \r\n\r\nBring on <em>'Dune Messiah'</em>! On that note, happy to read that director Denis Villeneuve has noted that he won't be rushing that one out - and rightly so!",

  "content": "This is certainly a great looking film to see on a big screen with some really effective, almost industrially sounding, audio - but what happened to the story? It's wafer thin and really stretched out for 2¾ hours. We pick up with \"Paul\" (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother (Rebecca Ferguson) trying to convince the \"Fremen\" that they are worth the hassle. Fortunately, leader \"Stilgar\" (Javier Bardem) is convinced of the messianic state of the young refugee, whilst their own reverend mother is on her last legs which might give \"Jessica\" a chance to prove her own worth, and provide an opportunity to peddle some embellished mythology about her son's ascendant propheteering. All of this manoeuvring and politicking is having quite an impact on \"Chani\" (the under-used Zendaya) and on the relationship between her and the increasingly worshipped new Duke. Meantime, now fully reinvigorated and emerged from his bath of recuperative Guinness, the evil \"Baron Harkonnen\" (an almost Zeppelin-like Stellan Skarsgård) has recruited his lethal nephew \"Feyd-Rautha\" (Austin Butler) to get to grips with the rebellion on \"Arrakis\" that is bringing him into the gaze of an ill-satisfied emperor (Christopher Walken). Battle lines are drawn! Now whilst I did enjoy this, the rest of the film is a gloriously photographed but slowly paced hybrid of \"Khartoum\" (1966) and \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962) with a bit of the \"Phantom Menace\" (1999) thrown in for good measure. The acting is adequate but the characterisations are all too routinely sacrificed at the altar of the stunning visuals and from about an hour to go, I was convinced this this was but part two of three (or maybe even more). Walken and Charlotte Rampling feature all too sparingly to make much difference, indeed even Zendaya's warrior-like tendencies seem to have been neutered rather and I though that Chalamet just tried far too hard to imbue his character with a strength that he was far more successful with first time round. That said, it does work well enough as a classy and well produced sci-fi adventure with plenty of action and mysticism but I needed more meat on it's bones. I still get distinctly squeamish when I watch what they do with the water, let alone where they get it from!!",

  "content": "This maybe hit the cinemas a month too early as there's a distinctly festive feel to this latest outing for the menacing \"Art\" the clown. He descends upon the townsfolk with blood-thirsty enthusiasm causing some brutal carnage but then he and his equally heinous pal \"Vicky\" (Samantha Scaffidi) go for a long nap. It's a pair of unfortunate demolition guys who provide their wake up entertainment and rejuvenated, they set out in search of \"Sienna\" (Lauren LaVera) and brother \"Jonathan\" (Elliott Fulham) - and woe betides anyone who gets in the way - even if you are dressed as Santa Claus. This is by far the best of the three so far, I think. There's much less repetition with the standard slashing-fayre and a bit more, dare I say, intimacy from our \"Terrifier\" as David Howard Thornton imbues his character with more akin to an emotional and quirky mime artist. There's more sadness, mischief and playfulness as he wields everything from an axe to a chain-saw. Shower sex might never be the same again! It's really the last half hour that gets it moving and though that scenario is largely predictable and I have to say that none of the speaking-part acting here is really very good, the tension mounts nicely and there's an entertaining degree of shock mixed with dark humour and Christmas gifts to raise a smile and maybe the one hair on the back of your neck towards the denouement. Sure, it's formulaic and there aren't so many surprises, but they are getting better and moving away from the Hammer style of ketchup gore and annoying, hysterical, frat-style characters that we've seen before. It's entirely forgettable, and far too long, but I did quite enjoy it.",

  "content": "**How \"Terrifier 3\" Redefines Horror Cinema and Mirrors Societal Anxieties**\r\n\r\n**Introduction**\r\nIn a cinematic landscape often dominated by high-budget blockbusters and familiar franchises, \"Terrifier 3\" emerges as a remarkable exception. Directed by Damien Leone, this low-budget horror film has defied industry expectations by grossing over $82 million worldwide against a modest $2 million budget. Beyond its financial success, the film offers a profound exploration of psychological fears, societal tensions, and subtle political commentary, redefining the potential of horror cinema in the 21st century.\r\n\r\n**A Subversion of Holiday Traditions**\r\nSet against the ironically cheerful backdrop of Christmas Eve, \"Terrifier 3\" subverts traditional holiday themes by delving into the darkest corners of human fear. The malevolent antagonist, Art the Clown - portrayed with chilling intensity by David Howard Thornton - embodies unpredictability and chaos. His reign of terror over Miles County isn't just a series of gruesome events; it's a relentless assault on the notions of safety, normalcy, and the comfort typically associated with the holiday season.\r\n\r\n**Psychological Exploration**\r\nAt its core, the film is a psychological study of fear and human responses to extreme situations. It taps into Carl Jung's concept of the \"shadow self,\" compelling both characters and viewers to confront the darker aspects of their psyche. Art the Clown is not merely a villain; he represents repressed anxieties and the chaotic potential within society. The notably subdued reactions of audiences - such as the silent screening experiences I experienced in CinemaCity in Romania - highlight the film's ability to reach deep into the subconscious, evoking a primal response that transcends typical cinematic experiences.\r\n\r\n**Social Commentary and Contemporary Relevance**\r\n\"Terrifier 3\" serves as a mirror reflecting contemporary societal fears. In an era marked by global uncertainties and the erosion of traditional safety nets, the film's disruption of the holiday idyll resonates powerfully. It challenges the illusion of security in familiar settings, suggesting that chaos can intrude upon life without warning. This theme is particularly poignant given current global anxieties related to political polarization, social unrest, and the fragility of societal structures.\r\n\r\n**Subtle Political Undertones**\r\nThe movie subtly weaves in commentary on the divisiveness and unpredictability that have characterized recent political landscapes, particularly echoing sentiments reminiscent of calls to \"make it great again.\" Even it might be a bit of a stretch interpretation it lands very well and align in reality we are today. Art the Clown's embodiment of chaos and his assault on societal norms can be interpreted as an allegory for the breakdown of traditional structures and the rise of polarizing forces. His relentless terror reflects the disruption of established conventions, forcing communities to grapple with unprecedented challenges - a parallel to the societal upheavals experienced during turbulent political times.\r\n\r\nThe narrative also examines leadership and authority. The inability of societal institutions within the film to contain or comprehend the terror inflicted by Art the Clown mirrors real-world frustrations with ineffective governance in the face of crises. This reflection invites contemplation on how societies become vulnerable when trust in leadership erodes.\r\n\r\n_Note: The interpretations presented regarding the political undertones, are my personal opinions and reflections. Don't get to excited! :)_\r\n\r\n**David Howard Thornton's Masterful Performance**\r\nThornton's portrayal of Art the Clown elevates the character from a mere slasher antagonist to a symbol of deeper psychological, social, and political fears. His ability to convey menace without dialogue relies on physicality and expressive nuance, creating a sinister charisma that is both repulsive and captivating. This performance is instrumental in making the film's thematic explorations resonate so profoundly with audiences.\r\n\r\n**The Appeal of Extreme Horror**\r\nThe film's financial success, despite - or perhaps because of - its extreme gore and brutality, speaks to a cultural fascination with boundary-pushing content. \"Terrifier 3\" taps into the audience's desire for cathartic experiences, offering a space to explore intense emotions and confront the darker facets of humanity. This attraction to extreme horror can be seen as a form of collective processing of fear and uncertainty, providing both an escape from and a reflection of real-world tensions.\r\n\r\n**Implications for the Film Industry**\r\n\"Terrifier 3\" challenges conventional wisdom in the film industry regarding the profitability and impact of low-budget productions. Its success demonstrates that audiences are hungry for content that is innovative, thought-provoking, and willing to push boundaries. The film exemplifies how strategic storytelling and thematic depth can overcome financial limitations, suggesting a shift in how success can be achieved in cinema.\r\n\r\nFor filmmakers and industry professionals, \"Terrifier 3\" serves as a case study in leveraging genre conventions to explore complex themes while engaging audiences on multiple levels. It highlights the potential for horror films to transcend entertainment, becoming vehicles for social commentary and philosophical inquiry.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion**\r\n\"Terrifier 3\" is more than a horror film; it's a bold artistic statement that challenges viewers psychologically, socially, and potentially politically . Damien Leone has crafted a work that is unflinching in its depiction of terror yet rich with depth and relevance. The movie invites audiences not only to experience fear but to question its origins and implications within the context of contemporary society.\r\nAs the film continues to captivate and unsettle viewers worldwide, it redefines the potential of horror cinema in the 21st century. \"Terrifier 3\" stands as a testament to the power of storytelling that is unafraid to delve into the complexities of existence, reflecting and challenging the societal and political currents of our times.\r\n\r\n**\"Terrifier 4\" is just inevitable!**",

What begins as an intriguing narrative with potential to explore Art the Clown’s backstory quickly dissolves into a series of chaotic, disconnected scenes that seem to exist solely to justify the excess of gore.\r\n\r\nCharacter development is practically non-existent, and any attempt to offer a narrative arc is abandoned in favor of an endless parade of graphic violence. While the special effects are impressive and true to the visceral spirit of the saga, it feels like an empty spectacle without a story to support it.\r\n\r\nFor fans of extreme gore, Terrifier 3 might meet expectations, but even for them, the lack of coherence in the script and the absence of a solid plot might prove frustrating. What could have been an opportunity to take the franchise to new levels of depth and creativity ends up being an exercise in shock for shock’s sake.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Terrifier 3 gets lost in its own excess, leaving viewers with an empty, exhausting experience that, while visually impactful, lacks narrative purpose.",

  "content": "> Try everything (but differently). So Disney has done it again.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful animation came to exist because of coming together of the directors of 'Tangled' and 'Wreck-it-Ralp'. It is Disney who had once again done it, since their rival Pixer is going down in a rapid speed. As a Disney fan since my childhood, I'm very happy for their success in live-shot films and animations, especially for this one.\r\n\r\nOkay, since the revolution of 3D animation over 20 years ago after overthrowing the 2D animation, most of the big productions like Disney, Pixer and Dreamworks with few others never failed to deliver. Believe me, I was not interested in this film when I first saw the teaser and trailer. But they have done great promotions and so the film did awesomely at screens worldwide. I was totally blown away after seeing it, Disney's another unique universal charactered story. From the little children to the grown ups, everybody definitely going to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of animals coming together happens only in cinemas, and that too mostly in animations. But todays kids are very sharp who ask lots of questions, so they had a fine explanation for the doubts regarding putting animals in a same society. It was like the United States, where everyone came from different continents and represents different race. And so in this film every animal came from different land to live together peacefully in a city called Zootopia.\r\n\r\nSo the story begins when Judy the rabbit follows her dream to become a police officer in Zootopia. There she meets Nick the fox, who are actually arch-rival species in the wild, but it was thousands of years ago before adapting the civilisation. So trust is what not promised between them, but they're forced to work together after a small missing person case becomes their prime agenda. Solving the mystery is what brings the end to this wonderful tale.\r\n\r\nThese days animations are not just concentrated on comedies, trying to get us emotionally as well. Maybe that's how they're grabbing the adult audience, especially the families. Shakira's cameo was the highlight, and her song 'Try Everything' helped the get attention from all the corners.\r\n\r\nThe Oscars was concluded just a couple of months ago, but it already feels like the fever is gripping again for the next edition and looks like this film is leading the way for the animation category. I know it's too early, but I hope it wins it. And finally a request for the Disney, bring it on a sequel as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n8/10",

  "content": "Zootopia is the latest family animation movie from Disney about a young bunny determined to be a cop at all costs  – in a land where only 'predators' are cops, she would be the first ‘prey’ cop. Seriously? Anyway, she puts on the hard work and makes it to the land where anything is possible.\r\n\r\nZootopia makes some good real life comparisons: Zootopia itself seems to look like New York, even including a hustle by a sly fox.  Racism seems to be ever present in both color and speech. But the best thing about Zootopia is Judy’s positive attitude and relentless determination to succeed.\r\n\r\nThe animation is as good as a Pixar animation – perfectly made  – and the story is well told, full of action scenes and funny moments. Kids will definitely love this one and grown up kids will enjoy the deep thought provoking tones set in this movie. \r\n\r\nThe best performance in this movie arguably comes from Police Chief Bogo whose voice is played by Idris Elba. His performance should earn him an Oscar this year! No wonder it has grossed 1 Billion dollars worldwide despite little marketing. \r\n\r\nRated 9 out of 10 only because we cannot give it a 10.",

It is a perfect blend of funny characters, decent story and little jokes spread around in the animation.\r\n\r\nAlmost all characters are very likable and funny, each in a different way. The actual story has quite a bit of suspense (for an animated family film) while still being sufficiently light and funny. Actually it is kind of two stories. One is the story of Judy Hopps fighting to prove herself as a police officer and the other is the more sinister evil plot that she attempts to unravel.\r\n\r\nThe movie moves at a good enough speed leaving enough room to both tell the story itself and inserting jokes and comical situations. The two bureaucratic sloths were quite fun already in their first scenes but the last scene with them at the very end of the movie was absolutely hilarious.\r\n\r\nThe animation itself was certainly adequate although I sometimes miss the old hand drawn animations from Walt Disney.\r\n\r\nOverall, one of the better, if not the best, animated movie I have watched in quite a while.",

  "content": "This film is named 'Zootopia' in the US but the title was changed when it was shown in the UK. I thought it is a very good children's film. Very well animated. Colourful. Really cute animals.\r\n\r\nIt is a great parable about tolerance and racism which could be seen as a mirror to the xenophobia in society today. The story is of a rabbit called Judy Hopps who overcomes diversity to become a police officer in the city of Zootropolis (Zootopia). This is a very tough city full of crime and only strong predators take charge. Judy must help to solve the case of predators disappearing around the city but needs to fight her colleagues' prejudices at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe jokes are funny and the story is intriguing. The film contains lots of references to other films which will keep viewers of all ages happy (including a very funny Breaking Bad spoof).\r\nThe voice acting is very good and each actor perfectly adds to their character.\r\n\r\n★★★★",

  "content": "Why I find Zootopia revolutionary\r\n==============================\r\n\r\n1. The creative design of the titular city, and the astonishing world building.\r\n\r\n2. Using colors and deliberately simple animation not just to make the movie appeal to children, but also to indicate the so-called ideal city of Zootopia where every animal is pure and innocent.\r\n\r\n3. Blending more than one genre into a single animated film while keeping the plot spotless and not messy.\r\n\r\n4. Delivering many contemporary messages and tackling some quite touchy timely themes that have never been explored in an animated film before. And by giving the priority to the center message, that of prejudice, nothing felt muddled and all over the place, since no message overshadowed the other.\r\n\r\n5. Using the on-the-surface message (achieve one's ambition) as a characteristic of the main character (Judy Hopps), not as the actual main message. That makes this message works as a motive not as a major theme in the movie as in, for instance, Wreck-It Ralph (I LOVE it, though ♥).\r\n\r\n6. Avoiding being over-sentimental, although Nick's character could have been easily used to manipulate our feelings.\r\n\r\nThis movie is an absolute masterpiece. Not only because its wonderful way that gives its many messages in, but also because the importance of its messages in themselves, and how smart and relevant they are. Today, children really need to be taught these morals.\r\n\r\nThe talented cast's voices fit their characters perfectly. It has a plenty of funny scenes littered with extremely hilarious jokes which we haven't heard before in any animated movie, or even in a live-action movie. This movie blends so many genres: Comedy, Adventure, Action, Crime, and Mystery. That said, you will never feel confused while watching it.\r\n\r\nThe characters are definitely some of the most complicated characters I've ever seen in an animated movie. Each character has its own point of view due to the experiences they had, and thus makes each character has different motives and feelings.\r\n\r\n(10/10)",

  "content": "I like <em>'Zootopia'</em>, it's much better than I had anticipated.\r\n\r\nFirst off, the animation is superb - as we expect from Disney of course, but that doesn't change the fact. Ginnifer Goodwin (Judy) leads the cast very well, while Jason Bateman gives the most memorable performance as Nick. Idris Elba and Jenny Slate (not Edie Falco or Constance Shulman, as I initially guessed... just me? Probably) are good too.\r\n\r\nThe premise is actually my favourite part of this film. I'm not saying it's anything revolutionary, but it actually feels fresh throughout - I enjoyed seeing it play out, it's paced perfectly. There's a nice <em>'Breaking Bad'</em> reference in there, too.\r\n\r\nAn entertaining 2016 animated film, one that also has a positive message. Recommended.",

  "content": "I quite liked the look of the new house that \"Chihiro\" and her parents were to move to, but she isn't so keen, and being ten had the weight of the world on her shoulders. En route to meet the removal men, her dad takes a wrong turning and soon, together with her mum, end up at the end of a tunnel. What would you do? Go in of course! Luckily it's quite a short walk before they find themselves in a small village that's full of shops all laid out for a banquet. Mum and dad tuck in but the young girl just wants to get going. Ignored, she explores a little as they gorge themselves and that's when she encounters the young \"Haku\" who suggests that she might like to leave. Snag is - her parents have quite literally now gone a bit porcine and she's going to have to rely on her new friend if she is to rescue them from an impending visit to the abattoir. A job is her first task, and for that she needs a contract with the wart-nosed witch \"Yubaba\" - and so off we go on a series of marvellously creative escapades discovering some coal spirits; that her friend has a secret identity; her boss an huge great baby and the entire place serves as a sort of bathhouse for the enigmatic \"No Face\" whose agenda isn't clear to anyone, though we do know he has a rapacious appetite and can make his own gold! The detail of the animation is astonishing and coupled with the mysticism of ancient Japanese folk lore works really well at creating a characterful and engaging story. I just love the lithe dragons of Oriental mythology as opposed to the scaly, stodgy, European ones. The concept of identity underpins much of the narrative here, with not just \"Chihiro\" but pretty much everyone else coming to terms with flaws and strengths in their personalities requiring a degree of human spirit, trust and forgiveness if ever anyone is to thrive and if ever she and her folks are to get to that new house on the hill. It's two hours really goes fly by and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",

Following straight on from the frustratingly incomplete scene setter that was Deathly Hallows Part 1, we continue to track Harry, Hermione and Ron as they search for the remaining Horcruxes that will render the evil Lord Voldermort as a mere mortal. This narrative thread is run concurrently with the Voldermort movements, where he now has in his possession The Elder Wand (the wand to rule them all) and has gathered a vast army to descend upon Hogwarts and achieve his ultimate goal of killing Harry. Meanwhile vital character story arcs are filled in and secrets will out...\r\n\r\nDavid Yates directs and Steve Kloves adapts to the screen, both of whom were perfect choices given their considerable input to the series. Smartly the pic has been kept to a 2 hour and 10 minute run time, and thankfully it flows nicely and the pace never stalls. Being one of those who has never read the books I can't say what has been left out or if anything has been tampered with for dramatic licence? What I know for sure is that the emotional investment garnered from being with this story for so long, to be part of these characters lives, watching them grow, ensures that this closure piece pounds the senses. Sitting down to watch it you realise that we are going to lose people we care for, and Hogwarts, the wonderful place we fist glimpsed across the night time water, is going to be attacked and reduced to a battle scarred place of war.\r\n\r\nAs the effects work dazzles and the one time child actors come shining through as mature actors who have casted off previous wooden traits, the story filling strands show just what wonderful work Rowling achieved on the page. Some of the characters never stood a chance in life, some carried deep emotional scars, and others  held secrets so crucial to the whole Potter universe. For a series of such fantastical genre sparkle, the Harry Potter world eventually reveals itself to be a deep and fortified humanist drama, and engaging it most certainly is. That this is achieved as battlefield carnage is raised, with wand wars booming up on the screen, it means credit is due to all involved the making of such a cherished and intensely followed Octalogy.\r\n\r\nIs it the earth shattering finale one hoped for? Well not quite. Story wise for sure that is the case, but with the whole story driving towards the final battle between Harry and Voldermort, it's disappointing to find it's rather brief and in truth anti climatic. Harry the boy now burgeoning into a man versus the snake faced despot surely should have been a crowning glory, but sadly not so. To compound this irritating disappointment, we then get the epilogue that is bogged down by aging make-up design that is almost laughable. But these are just annoyances, not film killers, for this has been a magical ride for 10 years. Fans will feel a gap in the heart now it's over, maybe even shed a Snape like tear as well? Yet ultimately it has been a triumph and the rewatchable factor for the whole series will always remain high. 8/10",

Still continuing on their search for the remaining horcruxes, they must use all of their skills and intrepidity before \"Voldemort\" finally returns to wreak havoc on their (and our) world. Radcliffe, Grint and Watson are very much comfortable in the parts now and that shows - their confidence and assuredness adds bundles to the cracking script and well paced direction from David Yates. Not just the three stars, but others we have seen for many of the series come into their own - Dame Maggie Smith (\"Prof. McGonagall\") gets some wand action, as does Julie Walters with a cracking duel with Helena Bonham-Carter's \"Bellatrix Lestrange\"; the magical effects are superb and the multiple threads all tie together well. Did it need to be two films? I suspect that the audience probably benefited from this in two instalments, but a director's cut of the whole thing in one fell swoop could make for an epic piece of cinema. Great stories, characters and a vivid imagination - a most enjoyable ride!",

The callbacks to the original are expertly done, the new characters are strong/well cast, it has plenty of meaning, music is fab and the action is outstanding - the aerial stuff is sensational.\r\n\r\nThe story is superb, with each high stake coming across as intended - parts even gave me slight goosebumps, which is a surprise given I'm not someone who has a connection to the 1986 film. It's all super neatly put together, I honestly came close to giving it a higher rating.\r\n\r\nTom Cruise is brilliant as he reprises the role of Maverick, while Miles Teller comes in and gives a top performance. Jennifer Connelly is another positive, though her role does kinda feel a tiny bit forced in order to have a love interest; given Kelly McGillis' [unexplained] absence.\r\n\r\nMonica Barbaro stands out most from the fresh faces, though I actually did enjoy watching them all - which is something I thought the film may struggle with, adding new people, but it's done nicely; sure Jon Hamm and Glen Powell are a little cliché, though overall I approve.\r\n\r\nA great watch - I'd highly recommend it, though naturally would suggest watching the previous film first if you haven't already.",

  "content": "It seems like I have been watching the trailers for this film for years now - and you know what? Yes - it was worth the wait. The film is all about some truly exhilarating aerial photography that culminates in some super dogfighting and a good old dose of nostalgia. Tom Cruise is very much in his element as the ageing - and frequently not afraid to look it - eponymous \"Top Gun\" pilot drafted in by a rather sceptical admiral to train up a new squad for a very perilous mission to destroy an underground uranium enrichment facility. The team arrive - full of hormones - and he must whip them into shape, a task made more difficult by the presence of \"Rooster\" (Miles Teller) who is the son of his old mate \"Goose\" who came to a sticky end last time out in 1986. He also gets to rekindle his romance with bar owner \"Penny\" (Jennifer Connelly) whilst all under the protection of his former wingman, now the poorly retired admiral \"Kazansky\" (Val Kilmer). To be honest, the story isn't really up to much - there are some twists and turns, the script is not without some humour but there is no jeopardy really. We all know what is going to happen in the end. That said, though, everyone is on good form; the pace (aside from the interludes with Connelly which do rather abruptly slow things down a bit) is consistently action packed and the imagery from both inside and outside of these amazing pieces of machinery is not at all repetitive and is compelling to watch. Even the usual gung-ho, ye-ha stuff is kept to a minimum - this is a superior film depicting the US military at it's most competitive, but also at it's most intelligent - and I really quite enjoyed it. Big screen photography - don't wait til it is on the telly.",

There’s better acting from the entire cast, more of an emotional attachment between at least two of the main characters in the film, and subtle humor that actually lands. But the film’s constant need to fly in the same flight pattern as the original film comes off as more of a restraint than a fond recollection.\r\n\r\nThe sequel seems to highlight many of the shortcomings of the original film, which in retrospect seems like something you’d try to avoid. With its record breaking box office during Memorial Day weekend, _Top Gun: Maverick_ is an enormously thrilling sequel with unparalleled action sequences that has proven to be exactly what fans have been waiting over 30 years for.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/Top-Gun-Maverick-2022-Review-Dont-Think-Just-Sequel",

The story is beyond simple and the game-based animation - though expertly crafted - did absolutely nothing for me as ninety minutes rolled along devoid of characterisations, thrill or much sense of adventure. I got the feeling this was really an outing for \"Mario\", \"Luigi\" and \"Peach\" designed to satisfy the die-hard fans, or the children - or both, but if you were not in on the game from the start then you are unlikely to have become any more engaged by the end of this fungi-fest. It wouldn't be fair to say this is bland - it's not designed to challenge or take risks: it's fun for those who grew up with \"Mario\" et al in their lives and I'm not going to decry that. It's colourful, pacy, and at times quite well written but perhaps it ought to have a rating that says if you are over 12 then you should be advised against it?",

  "content": "The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a fun ride through the iconic world of Mario. The screenplay is admittedly very bare bones, and the characters lack depth, but the film still manages to capture the essence of the beloved video game franchise. The writers do not attempt to do anything beyond create a narrative that intentionally puts our characters in worlds and areas that are instantly recognizable to the audience. This makes the film feel like a Mario game come to life so that audiences can say “that is like Mario Kart or Super Smash Bros.” The movie pacing flies at a breakneck speed, and I felt that this movie could have benefited from a slightly longer runtime to flesh out the story and characters a bit more.\r\n\r\nI was initially nervous about how the voice acting would hold up, but I was pleasantly surprised. Chris Pratt's voice as Mario is not over the top, which works well. It would have been extremely annoying to hear the super Italian Mario accent for a full hour and thirty minutes. Jack Black's portrayal of Bowser steals the show and was the best of the film. Anna Taylor Joy and Seth Rogan were good as Princess Peach and Donkey Kong, although I think Rogan may have injected a bit too much of himself in the character.\r\n\r\nThe direction of the film is solid, with great action set pieces and creative camera angles that make the action feel exciting and dynamic. The animation is stunning, with the characters and world directly designed off the games, but with more polish and details than ever before. The lighting is beautiful, with the bright lights of Rainbow Road and the dark, fiery flames of Bowser standing out as highlights.\r\n\r\nOverall, The Super Mario Bros. Movie may not be the deepest or most complex film, but it is a good time for fans of the Mario franchise. The movie captures the fun and whimsy tone of the games and brings it to life on the big screen. While the comedy may not hit every mark, the voice acting, and direction make up for it. I am excited to see where this film series goes next.\r\n\r\nScore: 72%\r\nVerdict: Good",

Especially the scenes with Bowser starting to sing. Ouch, my ears are still hurting.\r\n\r\nThe best parts of the movie was when they entered the ape kingdom. That was quite fun and so was the car chase on the rainbow road.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the movie was, for me personally, rather forgettable. Not bad just not that good.

Keegan-Michael Key, Seth Rogen and Anya Taylor-Joy are also positives as Toad, Donkey King and Princess Peach.\r\n\r\nNo doubt whatsoever that this will be the first film of a crap tonne from this franchise.

  "content": "If you saw Fang Li’s documentary from 2023 on the sinking of the “Lisbon Maru” then you’ll know it was a freighter travelling from Hong Kong to Japan carrying over a thousand British POWs. It was torpedoed by an US submarine and to say the treatment of the prisoners by their captors was inhumane would be the mother of all understatements! What this dramatisation does is shift the emphasis more onto the brutality of the occupying forces on a nearby Chinese island. There, the local population were controlled by a small garrison and prohibited from taking their fishing boats out to sea. There are two brothers, reputedly with pirate blood, who ignored this ban though and it was on one such trip that “Bi” (Yilong Zhu) and “Dang” (Lei Wu) discover the malnourished and emaciated “Newton” (William Franklyn-Miller) floating on the water. One thinks they should leave well alone, the other wants to rescue the man and after some scuffling and legerdemain, “Newton” finds himself on the island and the focus of a search by the forces now under the command of a particularly savage young lieutenant. Meantime, the stricken ship is slowly sinking and as the islanders can see the smoke and hear the explosions, they determine to set sail against the overwhelming firepower lined up against them, and try to save the people in the water being routinely slaughtered by machine-gun fire. There is a fair amount of CGI here and it’s not great, but the substance of the story quite successfully manages to mix the actual history with the courageousness of the fishermen and a little magical fantasy - these two brothers have positively Atlantean diving skills and can hold their breaths and fight the currents formidably - and is consistently paced throughout. The calculating violence and savagery of their enemies is well illustrated here and the two sibling characterisations are engagingly presented as their journey takes them, and the feisty “Hua” (Ni Ni) out to sea and into the teeth of a slaughter. The philosophy of the dramatisation reminded me at times of a bit of “Bridge over the River Kwai” meets “Tenko”; epitomised the oppression faced by a community that probably hadn’t changed much in generations and that was in no way equipped to deal with the rifle-armed squad of bullies who took control of their island for no real reason beyond that they could, and that that population was beneath their contempt. It’s a bit long, and clearly has a degree of modern-day jingoism to it’s style and presentation, but it keeps an important-to-remember story alive, and works well enough.",

  "content": "I am not usually drawn to romantic films where a woman changes her life and finds love when she least expects it. These films don't typically resonate with me, but I watched this one for review purposes and found myself really enjoying it. While the plot is simple, it is not without charm, and the acting meets the expectations for this genre, complete with its share of cheesy moments. However, it tells a pleasant story with some worthwhile themes.\r\n\r\nThe plot may be straightforward, but it is executed well, providing a satisfying narrative arc. The story centers on a woman trying something new and unexpectedly finding love, a familiar trope that is handled with care and sincerity. \r\n\r\nAnne Hathaway is the standout performer in this film. She has a remarkable ability to elevate even the most formulaic scripts, bringing nuance and depth to her character. Her performance is both heartfelt and engaging, making her character's journey compelling to watch. \r\n\r\nWhile the film includes many of the genre's typical elements, such as predictable plot points and moments of cheesy dialogue, it manages to use these conventions to its advantage. The familiar beats of the romantic drama are present but are handled with a light touch that makes them enjoyable rather than tiresome. \r\n\r\nThis film is a pleasant surprise. It might not break new ground in the romantic drama genre, but it offers a heartwarming story with strong performances. It's an enjoyable movie to watch with your significant other, providing a comforting mix of romance, humor, and genuine emotion. If you're looking for a feel-good film that touches on themes of love and self-discovery, this one is definitely worth a watch.",

  "content": "FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/everything-everywhere-all-at-once-spoiler-free-review\r\n\r\n\"Everything Everywhere All at Once is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year, finally putting Daniels on the mainstream radar.\r\n\r\nWith such a low budget, it's almost humiliating that so many expensive Hollywood blockbusters can't even reach the heels of so much originality, imagination, excitement, and emotion. Michelle Yeoh leads the troops in a film that also pays homage to the iconic career of the actress who, at 59 years old, accompanies the fantastic stunt team in truly outlandish fights.\r\n\r\nThe mother-daughter relationship as the emotional core of the story follows a surprisingly predictable path and needs a few more dialogues to deliver an even more powerful climax, but it still induces tears and a genuine sense of concern for the characters.\r\n\r\nTechnically, all the elements are so creatively unique that it warrants the clickbait \"you've never seen anything like this\".\r\n\r\nSee it in theaters!\"\r\n\r\nRating: A",

  "content": "A truly sensational film! The utter definition of a must-watch.\r\n\r\n<em>'Everything Everywhere All at Once'</em> is impressive from every single viewpoint. I had heard murmurs of it being a great film, yet it still managed to completely smash my expectations. This 2022 release features a superb cast, a fascinating story and some top notch visuals. The editing and pacing, in particular, are brilliant.\r\n\r\nThe onscreen talent are all fantastic, but Michelle Yeoh is still the absolute standout from this. What a performance! I could watch her in this role over and over and over. With that said, Ke Huy Quan (welcome back!) is awesome as well, as are Stephanie Hsu, James Hong and Jamie Lee Curtis. Everyone plays their part very, very well.\r\n\r\nAll of the humour lands, with some parts being truly funny. It also manages to show supremely enjoyable action alongside a highly meaningful side too. In short: EEAAO is outstanding - you must see it if you get the opportunity!\r\n\r\n<em>Raccacoonie 👀</em>",

  "content": "I loved both Michelle Yeoh (\"Evelyn\") and Jamie Lee Curtis (\"Deirdre\") in this entertainingly surreal take on the latest multi-verse theme to hit the cinemas. The former is a lady trying to balance the books at her failing laundry who must face the wrath of the latter - an imposing IRS investigator. Add to her woes, she has her hapless husband \"Waymond\" (Ke Huy Quan); her recently out lesbian daughter \"Joy\" (Stephanie Hsu) and her imperious and disapproving father \"Gong Gong\" (James Hong). Frankly, this poor woman does not have her troubles to seek. Then, all of a sudden, there is a rift - and in best Lewis Carroll tradition, \"Evelyn\" finds herself in not just one, but in multiple realities where she has everything from superpowers to a need to save the world from beings that would permanently unravel all the layers of existence on planet Earth. It's frankly impossible to adequately evaluate the plot - it lurches, veers, wobbles and meanders all over the shop with precious little linear to guide the viewer. It is a tour de force from Yeoh, well directed and scripted - frequently amusingly - that asks just as many questions as it strenuously attempts to avoid answering. It is aptly titled - and you need to have your eyes (and your brain) on wide beam to get the most from this feast of ostensibly nonsensical, but often poignant, series of escapades that search for what could constitute any degree of life-satisfaction for \"Evelyn\". A second viewing is highly recommended - it has plenty more to give once you've calibrated your senses after the first time, and big screen shows off some great VFX that do not impose themselves on this character-driven movie.",

The cinematography is surprisingly coherent given the almost manic visual quality the story demands, and it manages consistently to look great. The production design, lighting, costuming, VFX, etc., are all outstanding and are just a joy to watch. The performances are fantastic too! The main cast all knock it out of the park.\r\nHilarious, beautiful, hard-hitting, empathetic, and kinetic filmmaking.

  "content": "There can be many reasons why the original director of a franchise may decide not to return for a sequel, though they all usually have in common that they're very Hollywood-politically-correct. So exactly why Jon Favreau decided not to helm the third instalment of what is, for all intents and purposes, 'his baby' Iron Man, I can't be sure. But I can tell you one thing: something definitely changed.\r\n\r\nEverything about IM3 feels different from its predecessors. The atmosphere is darker, which is not to say it's really just a lot less humorous (which is – let's be honest – precisely what we love about Iron Man). The new characters are terribly underdeveloped and overall it's just a great deal less interesting. The storyline was completely vague to me; I'm still not really sure what the whole point of it was. And probably the biggest flaw of all – the first two films had really cool, interesting villains. This one's just really quite weird and not charismatic at all. Possibly at the core of the problem is the fact that it wasn't just one bad guy, it was many. The leading roles are shared by Guy Pearce and Sir Ben Kingsley, and – big shock – it was the latter who disappointed me the most. Not only was his role quite small, I thought it was also incredibly lame. I'd love to explain to you why, but that would be a major spoiler. I noticed some people in the audience laughing at the plot twist of Kingsley's character, but I thought it was just completely stupid and weak, and a total waste of such a great actor. Pearce is not bad, but never really manages to elevate his villain to a higher level, largely because he had zero character development to work with. Same thing with Rebecca Hall. Or the rest of Pearce's cronies for that matter... Too many to count. Sigh.\r\n\r\nWell, at least we still have Robert Downey Jr. He's as reliable as ever when it comes to carrying a film, but even he can't help it that his character is almost boring in this one. Where's the humour!? Where's the cynicism we all know and love?! Where's Tony bloody Stark! This is not the familiar overconfident, pompous macho we adore. All of a sudden, and for NO apparent reason whatsoever, this guy is insecure and suffering from anxiety attacks! What the F! Not to mention the fact that his superhero alter ego is almost completely absent for half of the film, because he's off somewhere in the middle of Tennessee finding himself or whatever... I mean, geez... I know the director left, but didn't any of the screenwriters return either? The fact that Pepper Potts had only about two minutes of relevant screen time also certainly didn't help. And when she was there, she was humourless and annoying. Big sigh.\r\n\r\nThe more I think about it, the more I'm having a hard time trying to think of good things to say about this film. At least the visual effects were solid, and the sound effects were awesome.\r\n\r\nThis was actually the first time I've seen a film in 3D. I've always avoided it because I was sure that it would be a complete distraction from the story. Turns out I was right in my assumption. I found it hard to focus on what was really going on, and this might have definitely been an influence in trying to follow the plot, so there's a big chance I missed a few things. Nevertheless, I can't help being very disappointed with Iron Man 3, especially since I love the first two so much.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely a filmmakers' case of \"could've, would've, should've\". They obviously tried very hard, but never quite manage to get there.\r\n\r\nNo story, no interesting characters, no filler. Nothing. Too bad.\r\n_(June 2013)_",

This was the movie that made me start to dislike the character of Tony Stark/Iron Man (RDJ is still the man though).  Stark's narcissism had charm in the previous films but here, it made him into a complete idiot, dick, and coward. The Mandarin had potential to be an effective villain but the movie scraps him for a more lame villain than Justin Hammer from Iron Man 2.  The comedy was forced and annoying and the story has plot holes that were distracting.  I watched Thor 2 a while after this released but the taste from this movie was so bitter that even though I thought Thor 2 was alright, I just didn't want to see anymore films from this cinematic universe.

Sure Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark is quite funny (not always but a lot of the time) and there are plenty of nice special effects and things being blown up.\r\n\r\nHowever, the story is just crap. The premise of Killian using the Mandarin for terrorism to cover up the fact that his experiments occasionally fails is just ludicrous. The Mandarin himself is a joke and another good example of how ignorant script writers just pick names out of existing material and uses them not caring how much they screw up established characters and world building already done. Whoever wrote this script should be ashamed of himself.\r\n\r\nWhat is worse, the entire movie is very anti-Iron-Man. It starts right of with Stark being obsessed by his Iron Man suits and a lot of harping about him stopping being Iron Man. Most of the time Stark is running around without his suit and the few times he is in it then the suit does not work properly or is shot off him almost immediately. Actually, most of Stark’s cool stuff is just shot to hell most of the time. \r\n\r\nThe end is full of fireworks but again, it is mostly a display in how you can destroy Iron Man suits and some more anti-Iron-Man crap.\r\n\r\nI cannot say that I did not enjoy watching the fireworks and special effects but as a whole I am disappointed with this movie.",

  "content": "**A long form review originally posted in 2013**\r\n\r\n_Iron Man 3_ brings us into the so called “Phase 2” of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But it does so in a flawed way. I’ve said it before and reiterate it here, there is no such thing as a perfect film. But since _The Avengers_ set the bar so very high, following that up proved to simply be too much for Black’s entry to handle.\r\n\r\nThere are a great deal of inconstancies, plot holes, stupid moves, illogical choices, and weak moments (though less than much of the internet would have you believe). These issues are not enough to lead to _Iron Man 3’s_ complete and utter downfall, but they do force a sour taste into the piece overall.\r\n\r\nThis isn’t to say it’s a bad movie though. In fact it’s actually quite good. It surpasses the quality of _Iron Man 2_ and plants itself firmly in the MCU rather successfully. A move which only _The Incredible Hulk_ failed to make, but still. Yes it has its problems, yes we’d hoped for better, and yes I’ve got complaints, but the movie is not at all a failure. Manages to come full circle in a way that still leaves Tony Stark & Iron Man a future in the Marvel Universe.\r\n\r\nShane Black and Drew Pearce manage to bring in a sense of vulnerability that was barely touched on in the past MCU works. Even the minuscule Steve Rogers of _Captain America_ seemed in control of every situation. But here we see Tony Stark as not only a breakable man, but a man in general. The most human of any Super Hero appearance in the MCU to date. Yes the Robert Downey Jr. wit that all have come to expect from the piece is still on the table, but in between and beneath that there’s an insomniac with extreme anxiety disorders living separated from the real world, too invested in his work and shattered identity to live as the Stark everyone expects him to still be.\r\n\r\nPepper and Rhodey are even given a chance to pick up the slack. The three form this sort of protagonist trinity, Saving one another in a round-robin Super Hero-y way with a little more depth than I’d expected.\r\n\r\nThe _Iron Man_ movies famously have had the most disappointing bad-guy-show-downs in the genre. And though here Black gives us much more of a delivery on this front than Favreau ever did, the issues I had with _Iron Man 3_ came (almost) exclusively from A.I.M, the Mandarin and Extremis (which form the antagonist trinity now that I think of it).\r\n\r\nSo, we’ve got better a better final confrontation, but from less integral bad guys. A more human hero, stuck in a less human adventure. A better interlocking of characters, with less to do on screen. I could go on with this roller coaster, but that word essentially sums up the film. Not in that its a cliched “thrill ride”, but in that it’s a constant mess of ups and downs, with the final destination just barely justifying the start point.\r\n\r\nSpeaking non-comparitively, _Iron Man 3_ makes a good movie. Not great. But so very, very worth the watch. It’s hard for me to think objectively separate from the other films in the MCU, because I’ve seen them all so many times that there’s no way for me to forget all that’s come before when watching the movie. I’d be interested to hear from somebody who’s watched _Iron Man 3_, but not _Iron Man 1_ & _2_ or _The Avengers_. I’m sure such a person exists somewhere, and if so your input would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nI think I might have made it seem as if I disliked Iron Man 3 more than I actually did. Here’s why. From _Iron Man 2_ until _The Avengers_, I watched all the MCU films in cinemas. After each one, I immediately got that feeling of wanting to go back and watch it again, a feeling that steadily grew as time passed. Each film that Marvel released had me feeling this more strongly than the last, culminating in _The Avengers_ which I saw six times in theatres, and immediately pre-ordered the whole set on Blu-Ray the moment it became available (I bought a PS3 for the sole purpose of watching them). But with _Iron Man 3_ I sort of dropped back to a pretty low interest level once I’d left Hoyts. It seemed that although it was a really good watch, it just didn’t have the staying power I’d come to expect from these incredible Super Hero films.\r\n\r\n67%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_",

  "content": "_**Worthwhile, but a bit of a letdown compared to the snappy \"Iron Man 2\"**_\r\n\r\nReleased in 2013, \"Iron Man 3\" stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark in this third installment where Shellhead takes on the so-called Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) and A.I.M. (Advanced Idea Mechanics), led by Killian (Guy Pearce). After Stark's personal world is destroyed, he is left to survive by relying on his ingenuity and instincts to rise from the ashes and protect those closest to him, like Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow). In the process Tony seeks to answer a question that has haunted him: Does the suit of armor make the man or does the man make the suit of armor? Don Cheadle and Jon Favreau are on hand as James Rhodes (War Machine) and Happy Hogan respectively while Rebecca Hall plays an agent of A.I.M.\r\n\r\nAfter the absolutely kinetic (and inexplicably criticized) \"Iron Man 2\" this third part of the trilogy is a bit of a letdown. It's a quality superhero movie, but the first act is lethargic compared to the dynamic initial reel of the previous movie. Things pick up in the second act as Stark is separated from his loved ones and presumed dead, forced to team up with a brainiac kid. While some claim that the movie's \"more serious\" than \"Iron Man 2,\" it has the same tone and the same main characters/cast; the amount of \"more seriousness\" is marginal.\r\n\r\nPeople say \"Iron Man 3\" plays better on repeat viewings, so I'll update this review after future viewings. But I was letdown by the lame representation of the Mandarin, the ambiguous powers of the A.I.M. operatives, the myriad Iron Man suits functioning without a person in them and the fact that everyone and their brother dons the Iron Man armor or parts of it. For instance, Pepper morphs into a veritable superheroine at one point. Nevertheless, it's not bad at all and the cast is great with Rebecca Hall and Guy Pearce effective in their roles.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 130 minutes and was shot North Carolina, Southern California and Miami.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C+",

  "content": "**It's a substantially weaker film than its two predecessors.**\r\n\r\nAfter two frankly good films, I was curious to see what this film would bring to the public, who immediately set out to fill the studio's coffers with their tickets money. Marvel has discovered an excellent financial lode by transposing most of its characters to the cinema, and this film is destined to be a box office success, although the quality is much more questionable.\r\n\r\nI'll start with what I usually leave for last: the technical aspects and production values ​​are really excellent and constitute the strongest and most solid point of the film. Directed by Jon Favreau, who has held his chair since the first “Iron Man”, the film has retained most of the crew and core cast, which helps give the trilogy the flavor of a unique work. With a solid bet on more flashy, loud and spectacular action, the film wants to appeal to a young audience that wants something big, where CGI and effects can create authenticity and a sense of danger. The quality of the effects is undeniable, but the excessive action takes a toll on the final set. It looks like a video game, a recurring mistake in these types of movies.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the film has good cinematography, it was beautifully shot, it is sharp, and it has excellent colors and light. The work of the stuntmen is meritorious, yet regularly forgotten in the minds of viewers. The sets and costumes are very good, especially Tony Stark's house and the various armors from the movie. Another word for the soundtrack, by Dwight Yoakim, which proved to be up to the task without, however, proving to be memorable.\r\n\r\nThe cast includes most of the names we already know from the previous two films, with Robert Downey Jr. the most relevant for maintaining the leading role. The actor is good, deserves our credit, and I recognize that he tried to give his character a greater maturity and sense of experience. In this film, Stark is a much more mature, traumatized, tired and even fragile man, and his relationship with Pots has become more formal and firm, causing the former playboy to settle down and carry on a serious love relationship. I understand that this may displease some, but the film seems to take place several years after its predecessor, “Iron Man 2”, and makes mention of several events, in the meantime. With excellent technical work and the use of excellent makeup artists, Ben Kingsley shone in the role he was given and which is clearly one of the best of his recent career. Paltrow and Cheadle also leave us a positive record of his work, although it wasn't as intense as one would expect. Favreau, in addition to directing the film, has a brief funny cameo as Happy. But it's Guy Pearce and Rebecca Hall we should be worried about: they do what they can, and yet the film didn't give them much of a chance to do more and better.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem with this movie is, of course, the plot and writing of the script, dialogues and scenes. Attempts at comedy are very unpleasant, and Stark, who once had almost a barrage of phrases and jokes for all occasions, is now a serious and weary man. The material given to the actors is scarce and does not bring anything really good. In addition, the film has almost no connection with the previous films, and especially “Iron Man 2”, whose events are never really spoken by anyone.",

Iron Man 3 focuses much more on Tony Stark and his trauma following The Avengers rather than on Iron Man and the suit. A large portion of the film and even some action scenes explore who Stark is without the high-tech suit or fancy technology in general. Stark grapples with the fallout of past decisions and has to decide who he is at his core without the money or Iron Man. As expected, the entire cast dazzles in their performances, from Robert Downey Jr. To Don Cheadle to Gwyneth Paltrow, but the true standout is Ben Kingsley's Mandarin. Iron Man 3 is all about Stark's growth and development, and while that's a great idea, its poor villain and lack of actual Iron Man leave the film feeling a little hollow. I still appreciated the movie and its Christmas cheer, but the MCU has far better Iron Man movies and moments to enjoy.",

The war of Kens during the last half hour of the film is an all-timer because a battle full of handsome maneuvers, like showing off their naked chest and manly noogies, turns into a full on dance off between Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu.\r\n\r\nBut the second half of the film leaves a thought-provoking message in your brain regarding both men and women. The Kens gaining respect little by little mirrors how women eventually earned their rights to be respected individuals — after being considered as only being useful in the kitchen or for making babies — except with the gender roles reversed and nude blobs instead of genitalia.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://bit.ly/beachoff",

  "content": "\"Thus Spake Zarabarbie\" - that's the opening message as narrated by Dame Helen Mirren who gives us a potted history of the doll - from it's origins as an inanimate plaything of young girls to it's current status as an empowering conduit for young girls to emerge into society as uninhibited and aspirational beings with only the sky as the limit. Well, that's the philosophy in Margot Robbie's \"Barbieland\". A sterile sort of environment that lives it's life along the lines of a pink \"Groundhog Day\". Men? Well yes, there are - as embodied by the tanned, rippled and toned \"Ken\" (Ryan Gosling) but they are very much the in-app purchase in this world, with little purpose aside from augmenting a \"Barbie\". Strangely, one morning, the stereotypical \"Barbie\" finds she has lost some of her charm! She is flat footed, her endlessly elysian existence is fraying at the edges? What do do? See \"Weird Barbie\" (Emerald Fennell) and seek her sagely advice. That, however, she doesn't like. She must enter into the real world and find whoever is supposed to be playing with her - clearly not an happy girl - and see if she can cheer her up and restore the equilibrium. En route, she finds that her ever devoted \"Ken\" will join her and their arrival in the big city introduces both to a bewildering world of sexists, misogynists and cynics. The latter best exemplified by \"Sasha\" - her somewhat disenchanted owner. When the boss of Mattel (Will Ferrell) discovers her escape, he mobilises the whole of his organisation to get her back in her box whilst an equally disillusioned but newly engaged \"Ken\" heads back to his home realising that maybe the men don't have to live quite such understudy lives. Can she elude her pursuers long enough to befriend \"Sasha\", her much less cyclical mother \"Gloria\" (America Ferrera) and then get home before both of her world's are alien to her? This is good fun, this. Gosling is a talented actor who can also churn out a decent power ballad (there are a few) and there is the oddest of chemistries here between him and an very much on-form Robbie who puts her heart and her soul (and loads of joyous/bemused facial expressions) into this role. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have written a witty script that pitches the naive and the innocent in with the venal and the observational. It swipes at all things sexist - and not just from the woman's perspective either - and though it does ridicule the restrictions society has put on the historical progression of women through the ranks of corporate America, it does so in a positive and enjoyable satirical manner. Will Ferrell - I can take him or leave him - is really only adequate as the epitome of the male dominated company structure but there is quite a nice set of scenes with Rhea Perlman (for ever \"Carla\" from \"Cheers!\") who portrays the inventor - if that is the word - of the whole \"Barbie\" concept, and who knits it all nicely together towards the end. Don't be a snob about this, get yourself into a cinema and prepare to be entertained. Bergman it isn't, but an enjoyable evaluation and parody of 21st century life, opportunity and all things vacuous it certainly is.",

It's an adult movie with childhood references (not a kids' film at all), and seems pitched at people roughly my age (Matchbox 20 referenced as a track for wooing is too close for comfort!) It _superbly_ voices the internal contradictions women need to navigate to be accepted. It works hard not to centre Ken, even while his role is a critical counterpoint, but also gives a little airtime to how much a male-dominated world makes it hard to be a man too.\r\n\r\nThe writing is out of this world, the pacing is spot on, and Margot Robbie utterly _nails_ the role — especially the emotional and physical aspects of being a doll in a way that playfully nods to the many ways that children play with Barbie.\r\n\r\nIt's a wonderful film that I'd encourage everyone to see. It's _hard_ to watch, as a man—feeling responsible for so many challenges women face—but Barbie doesn't judge, it voices. It's a message that informs me, helps me, as well as entertaining me, but it isn't meant for _me_; the extent to which Yvette felt seen, understood and perfectly spoken on behalf of _is_ this movie, and why it deserves all the praise it's getting.\r\n\r\nOriginally posted at: https://www.byjp.me/posts/reviews/movies/barbie/",

  "content": "“Heavy is the arm that wears its heart on its sleeve.” That’s the best way to sum up this overwritten, overlong, stunningly obvious treatise on gender equality, consumerism and existentialism, whose messages get beaten to death beginning early on and never let up, an exhausting experience, to be sure. Writer-director Greta Gerwig’s latest offering, co-written with collaborator Noah Baumbach, features a dreadful script that’s about as subtle as a young adult novel, drones on and on and on for about 30 minutes longer than it needs to be, becomes endlessly repetitive, and incorporates story threads that could have easily been scaled back or eliminated entirely (such as those with Will Ferrell and Michael Cera). What’s more, much of the dialogue is either stupefyingly juvenile or sounds more like “writing” than anything anyone would actually say (even for a fictional fantasy character), with attempts at humor that often fall woefully flat. And, to be honest, for all intents and purposes, the project comes across like a two-hour commercial for Mattel (even if the company manages to find ways to poke fun at itself). To its credit, “Barbie” does have a few strengths going for it, such as its superb production design, some genuinely clever humor (especially its opening pre-titles sequence and occasional asides), and fine performances by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling (who manage to make this material look better than it actually is), as well as a heartwarming appearance by Rhea Perlman. Beyond that, though, this is handily the most overrated, overhyped release of the summer movie season, one that I’ll easily forget before year’s end – and one that conclusively proves the power of marketing, no matter what the quality of the merchandise being promoted.",

  "content": "**Barbie's breathtaking visuals and practical effects outshine the erratic storytelling to make a fresh and innovative movie with themes that will be divisive for many.**\r\n\r\nBarbie is a visually stunning achievement that has excelled at the box office while dividing audiences. On the one hand, Barbie amazes with extravagant practical sets and exceptional performances, but on the other hand, the story and directing feel chaotic and erratic. The target audience seems to be moms who played with Barbies and would bring their daughters to the film. Therefore, some film's themes feel more grown up than expected for a movie about a child's toy. Despite probably not being the primary target demographic, I enjoyed the film, especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling's performance. They elevated the story and script to the successful giant the movie has become. The casting of Kate McKinnon and Will Ferrell was perfect for the roles they portrayed. The sets and production design were some of the most impressive I have ever seen in a film! The story was unfocused and unpredictable but also fun and lighthearted. While I wouldn't say Barbie was perfect, and its themes a little too complex for a movie about a toy, its production design and unique story stood out in an era of remakes and sequels.",

  "content": "A squad of American soldiers seemingly randomly select an house in Ramadi and having relocated it’s sleeping occupants to the ground floor, set up a sniper station from where they can monitor the goings on around them. Initially, this all looks harmless enough as the Iraqi locals go about their business, but gradually the spotters become suspicious of repetitive activity, the odd person who seems to be snooping on them - and then, well all hell breaks loose leaving them facing an existential threat that will test their mettle, their equipment and require some feats of legerdemain if they are to survive long enough to be rescued. There is quite some intensity to this drama as the young men under siege must each deal with their fears, strengths and weaknesses under a constant stream of fire. Will Poulter’s “Erik” leads the team, but the best effort for me came from his comms man “Ray” (D’Pharoah Woon-A-Tai) and, though sparingly, from Kit Connor’s rookie “Tommy” who, like us watching, had no idea what they were doing in this house and what the purpose of their mission actually was in the first place. There isn’t so much a script as an increasingly nervous dialogue that disintegrates as their predicament becomes more perilous and the photography and particularly the audio serve really well in conveying a sense of the lethally claustrophobic atmosphere in which these men had to function. Real veterans wrote the story, advised the production and that shows in something that is certainly incomplete from a narrative perspective, but is uncomfortably enthralling to watch and graphically displays the horrors of urban warfare.",

  "content": "They say “War is hell,” and, without a doubt, there’s plenty of evidence to back up that contention. But rarely, if ever, does anyone say that “War is boring,” although that can certainly be said about its depiction in this latest offering from writer-directors Alex Garland and Ray Mendoza. This fact-based account tells the story of a Navy SEAL unit charged with providing support for a US Marine operation in Ramadi during the Iraq War in 2006. Filmed in real time, the picture seeks to take viewers onto the front lines of this urban warfare setting, one that results in an ambush by insurgents armed with grenades, guns and IEDs, leading to fatalities and multiple life-threatening injuries. The attack, in turn, necessitates calls for evacuation that place the rescuers in extreme peril as street fighting intensifies around them, portraying this hazardous battlefield scenario in an authentically choreographed re-creation of on-the-ground events. But, in depicting the conflict, the filmmakers ponderously commit the grave error of making it mind-numbingly dull; it’s so “clinical” and by the book that it’s devoid of any sense of viewer engagement, with no character development, no emotional involvement and virtually no background about why any of this is transpiring in the first place. In fact, the narrative so anonymizes the circumstances surrounding this incident that the film ends up coming across like little more than a big screen version of a video game. Frankly, that raises the question, what’s the point of this, and why should the audience care? To compound matters, the picture’s protracted opening sequence, which chronicles the preparation and intelligence-gathering setup for the main event, goes on forever, leaving viewers wondering if anything is ever going to happen. And, when it at last does (and quite predictably at that, a quality that characterizes the film overall), the story becomes little more than an endless stream of gunshots, explosions and grotesquely wounded soldiers screaming in agony. Is this supposed to be “entertainment”? Indeed, by that point, “Warfare” becomes more of an endurance test than an estimable work of cinema. It thus makes one wonder about the purpose behind this production. If the intent is the misguided glorification of combat, it doesn’t do much to favorably make its case. And, if it’s meant to declare an anti-war statement, it seems strangely proud and self-congratulatory of its achievements in capturing the authentic look and feel of conflict, qualities that would appear to undercut such a core message. Even setting aside these philosophical issues, the film’s lack of focus beyond the battlefield footage causes it to fail even as a war picture in purely conventional terms when compared to countless other predecessors, including any number of World War II and Vietnam Era offerings, as well as more contemporary releases like “Black Hawk Down” (2001), “The Hurt Locker” (2008), “Good Kill” (2014) and “Eye in the Sky” (2015). When all of these considerations are taken collectively, this release has little going for it on so many fronts that it’s difficult to fathom the rationale for its existence – or a reason why anyone would realistically want to see it.",

She is born and trained on Themyscira, the hidden island where the powerful warrior women known as the Amazons live. One day, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), an American World War I spy, crashes off the coast of Themyscira and is rescued by Diana and the two team up to take down Ares, the God of War, and the Germans, who are developing a very deadly form of mustard gas. There are fantastic action sequences in this film, especially by Gal Gadot. It's amazing to see her single-handedly storm the German front, inspiring the Allies to fight with her. Gadot takes over from the legendary Linda Carter and makes the role her own. She has great chemistry with Pine. They are complete equals in this film. It's refreshing to see the female lead in a superhero film not be the love interest. The only negative part of the film are the lackluster villains. Hopefully, Wonder Woman will have more formidable foes in future films.",

  "content": "**DC Hits A...Bunt. But compared to the strikeouts, a bunt seems impressive.**\r\n\r\nWonder Woman had some things working for it--things other comic book movies have faltered on. But it had a lot of things not working for it too. The result is an average median between what works and what doesn't. While the film is spectacular within the struggling DCEU, as a stand alone film it's mediocre at best. \r\n\r\nDiana's origin story--how she came to be and how she came to be a super hero was refreshing. It showcased the world of the Amazon warriors. It was unique in the often cookie-cutter super hero origin stories. Patty Jenkins did a good job of framing it, but I think the character's origin story dating back to the comics has always been unique in comparison to other super heroes.\r\n\r\nThe result is that the first third or so of the movie is satisfying--despite dull performances from Gal Gadot and Chris Pine (who had zero chemistry as a couple). But once we leave the confines of the island and enter the real world, the movie becomes hit or miss. WWI (that's right, WWI now, not WWII. The reason for the change in setting is never apparent) London is portrayed in a way that is almost a distraction. Yes, the world isn't white washed; diversity is a thing--a wonderful thing at that. But DC's version of Captain America's Howling Commandos consist of an Arab and an American Indian. Diversity for diversity's sake becomes distracting--especially when paired with a low-rent Simon Pegg whose soul function is being a deadly sniper who never fires his weapon (that's helpful on a top-secret mission behind enemy lines). \r\n\r\nIt's almost as if the movie telegraphs all of these unnecessary plot hiccups to remind you that this is a super hero film, and no matter how much the mortal humans fail, it will all be okay because the super hero will save the day. \r\n\r\nThe dialogue can be clichéd at times, and the final theme of the movie--one of love conquering all and the acknowledgement that, overall, mankind is good, is laughable in it's amateur preachiness. \r\n\r\nBut what the film lacks in substance and script, it makes up for in the visuals. I found the action sequences to be great fun. Heavily stylized \"Matrix-style\" fight scenes seem right at home in a film about super hero Gods. The freeze frames worked too--as fight sequences froze in over-the-top super hero poses that harkened back to the source material's comic book roots.\r\n\r\nThe final confrontation between Wonder Woman and Ares--while dragging on a little long--was well done, being one of the few super hero movie climaxes that delivered. \r\n\r\nWhile aspects of the movie were so similar (Hell! Identical!) to Captain America: The First Avenger, I actually felt embarrassed for the filmmakers, I did come away thinking this was the movie Captain America should have been. It succeeded in places where Captain America failed miserably. \r\n\r\nThe movie is entertainment--pure, fun, pop-corn-gobbling entertainment. In that realm, it succeeds and succeeds well. But as a piece of cinematic art, it falls flat on its face with too many plot holes, script inconsistencies, clichés and mediocre acting. Wonder Woman will be an important movie for both the DCEU and the summer of 2017. But it lacks the magic and staying power of Nolan and Donner's contributions to DC comics' films.",

  "content": "I quite enjoyed this movie. When I learned that Zack Snyder had his fingers in it I got a worried since he recently wrote such atrocities as Batman vs Superman and sure enough the story is a really the weakest part of the movie. A typical nonsensical, unintelligent, Hollywood story/script were you are better off putting your brain in idle when watching it.\n\nHowever it makes up for this with cool special effects and, surprisingly, quite enjoyable characters. This is definitely a movie that you watch for the sake of the special effects. Well, if you are a male teenager you might also be watching it to drool over Gal Gadot of course (I have to admit that she is hot).\n\nThere is not too much to say about the plot. Our Amazon hot chick discovers that there is a war going on and goes out to stop it. Since she has been overly protected by her guardian she is amazingly clueless about life outside of her little island. Especially aspects involving men. Something which creates some funny moments as well as some embarrassingly silly ones. This, Diana’s gradual evolution where she not only is learning about life but also discovers her considerable powers, is one of the enjoyable aspects of the movie though. It is of course also one of the dummer aspects of the movie. How the f… could the Amazon Queen race Diana to be so ignorant about everything?\n\nAnother not so enjoyable part of the movie is the ludicrous scenes where the britts are trying to obtain peace at all costs as well as the stereotypical portrayal of Ludendorff as some megalomaniacal, half crazy war-mongerer. This was just dumb. I guess Zac Snyder just picked the name out of some history book without bothering to read up on the character. Typical lack of intelligence and respect, a la Hollywood, for anything outside of their, very limited, sphere of knowledge.\nWell, at least Danny Huston did a pretty decent job of the shitty role he was given. So did most of the rest of actors. I definitely liked Gal Gadot as Super Woman but then, although I am not a teenager, I am still a male so maybe I am biased when it comes to her?\n\nI definitely liked the special effects. The showdown at the end was great as far as I am concerned and the rest not bad either. They could have been even better though if it would not have been so obvious that the Germans where mostly incompetent extras waiting for Wonder Woman to show off her gymnastics and slow motion abilities. Come on, even superhero special effects should make some pretense of being “realistic” superhero special effects.\n\nThe movie is definitely aimed at the young adult segment. Unfortunately it do not seem to know what it is aiming for. Sometimes it is almost adult, sometimes it is late teen and sometimes just so bloody TV-show silly that you’re wondering if it is aiming for even pre-teens.\n\nAnyway, regardless of its faults I did enjoy my 2+ hour spent on this movie. Enough to give it a 4 out of 5 rating",

She nailed it, and so set to direct the sequel too. Even the supporting cast was good. DC's visuals always high standards and so this one. Action sequences too amazing. There's lots of changes in the character, as well as in everything. Firstly a nice superhero costume. And connections like Diana's father, the island, all pretty nicely written out.

The princess of the island (Gal Gadot) leaves with the captain to help end the Great War and destroy Ares forever.\r\n\r\n\"Wonder Woman\" (2017) combines the Wonder Woman TV series (1975-1979) with elements of “All Quiet on the Western Front” (1979), \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (1981), “The Dirty Dozen” (1967), “Captain America: The First Avenger” (2011) and “Man of Steel” (2013). It’s a well done modern superhero flick and superior to both “The First Avenger” and “Man of Steel.”\r\n\r\nThe opening paradisal island sequence is good without overstaying its welcome. The story really picks up when Captain Steve Trevor and Diana depart the island. They have great chemistry and their relationship adds human interest. \r\n\r\nUnlike “Man of Steel,” which devolved into super-beings constantly pulverizing each other in the second half, “Wonder Woman” has the poise to take its time and establish an interesting assortment of characters. The entire midsection is great, but the last act, to be expected, comes down to two super-beings pounding each other. But at least the creators tried to add a weighty moral.  \r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 21 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B",

  "content": "Over a decade after a little-known director from New Zealand managed to con New Line Cinema into giving him $300 million to make a trilogy based on JRR Tolkien's seminal fantasy (and long considered unfilmable) work The Lord of the Rings, the cinematic landscape for fantasy has changed drastically. Much like Tolkien's tome, the Lord of the Rings films came to utterly define high fantasy in film, with even competing fantasy adaptations like The Chronicles of Narnia and Alice in Wonderland cribbing from Peter Jackon's critically-acclaimed, audience-adored multipart epic. Now Jackson has returned to the land that made him famous for a go-round with Tolkien's earlier work, The Hobbit.\r\n\r\nTolkien's The Hobbit is far more modest in scope than its enormous sequel, and geared for a younger audience. It introduced the world to Bilbo Baggins, a typically quiet hobbit who is coaxed into adventure by the grey wizard Gandalf, enlisted to aid thirteen dwarves in reclaiming their long-lost homeland.\r\n\r\nJackson had the unenviable task of following up on his blockbuster Academy Award-winning masterpiece, and initially passed off the directing responsibilities to fantasy master Guillermo del Toro. Difficulties securing the film rights led to delay after delay, and del Toro finally departed, leaving the original creative team the ability to step back into place and create a follow-up/lead-in with the same creative staff in front of and behind the camera. Jackson returned as director, co-writing with Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens (though del Toro retains a screenwriting credit), Andrew Lesnie as cinematographer, and Howard Shore as composer, along with all of the other stalwarts of the original trilogy.\r\n\r\nThe lone exception to that is the recasting of Martin Freeman as the titular hobbit, taking over for the aging Ian Holm. Holm appears in the film's framing sequence (a scene that takes place immediately prior to the beginning of The Fellowship of the Ring), along with that trilogy's star, Elijah Wood. But this time out, it's Freeman's show, and he's as charming, witty, and engaging as you could imagine. He also makes a perfect Young Ian Holm. The casting is truly inspired. Sir Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf (here playing his more impish grey incarnation, rather than the frankly humorless white version) and the heralded thespian manages to imbue his character with both immense power and gravitas, while still throwing in little flourishes that sell Gandalf as an imperfect man, rather than just an all-knowing power. Rounding out the third of this film's main characters, and an addition to this world, is Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, the leader of the motley crew of dwarves. Armitage likewise manages to imbue Thorin with both rage and honor, and is easily believable as someone who could lead these dwarves into life-threatening battle. The other twelve dwarves are something of a blur, but a few of them manage to make an impression, even with limited screen time. I imagine the two future installments of the series will afford them each the chance to shine.\r\n\r\nWhich brings up the most contentious point of this whole Hobbit affair: the fact that it's a three-part epic. The Hobbit, as written, is a comparatively slim tome of around 300 pages (compare that to The Lord of the Rings' combined 1,600). This installment alone is ten minutes shy of a whopping three hours. And as anyone who's seen The Return of the King can attest, Jackson can get rather indulgent at times (the end[s] of that film). Initially the film was going to be split in twain, then later divvied up into three parts. Tolkien, ever the completist, wrote volumes of backstories for this world, and Jackson decided to pull from them to bulk out these films.\r\n\r\nI've seen a lot of hay being made about the film being bloated and, yes, indulgent. I'm an editor at heart, and am generally hyper-sensitive about cutting down to the bone. But the strangest thing happened on the way to the Lonely Mountain: I found myself simply rolling along with the shaggy-dog pace of the film. It's astonishing in hindsight. The film virtually redefines \"taking the scenic route,\" but the crazy thing is I didn't mind it in the least. I believe it's because of the lowered stakes of The Hobbit. Every single frame of The Lord of the Rings was suffused with overbearing doom; that trilogy's \"save the world\" plot became as heavy a burden to bear as the ring hung around Frodo's neck. But The Hobbit is lighter, freer, funnier, and doesn't have the weight of the world on its shoulders. It's rather the difference between having an appointment you need to get to in heavy traffic and taking a weekend to just drive around, stopping when and where you like. This pace will likely have a dire impact on the film's rewatchability, but sitting in the theater for a midnight showing? Magic.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the film itself seems to have ADD. Its innumerable diversions began to remind me of a live-action Family Guy episode, with character or event mentions that suddenly cause the film to cut away to a dramatization of said. But again, and I can't stress enough how unexpected this was for me, I didn't mind in the least (with one exception: it appears to be an inviolable rule that any scene in Rivendell will stop a film dead in its tracks).\r\n\r\nThe craft of the film manages to best that of its predecessor trilogy: Howard Shore turns in one of his most stirring scores, the production design and art direction are again immersive and beautiful, and Andrew Lesnie continues his unique style of cinematography combining gorgeous shots (wonderful) with frequently blowing out highlights (distracting and ugly).\r\n\r\nOne complaint I do have is Jackon's newfound over-reliance on CGI. Azog the Defiler (a chief antagonist of the film) and the Goblin King (a bit of a lark) are the sorts of character that would have (and should have) been practical effects in the original trilogy. Here they're fully CGI, and their menace is undermined by it. Gollum returns for his most famous scene, and looks wonderful; Andy Serkis' performance and the CGI truly sell this pitiful creature. CGI can be pitiful but not threatening, it appears.\r\n\r\nI don't know what the other two installments of The Hobbit have in store. What I do know is that this return to Middle-earth is off to a great start, and if this is any indication of things to come, I'll most assuredly enjoy the ride.",

I am sure there are complex reasons applicable to me. I read them when I was very young and it would be difficult to match that first-time experience. Also, the fighting and battles seem more central to the story than I remember. Perhaps that relates more to the modern movie audience rather than my memory.\r\n\r\nAs a funny side note, the film seemed to resemble in places that other fantasy series: the Jurassic Park franchise, in that they seemed to always be going from one close call to another, and the Wizard or somebody repeatedly yelled, “Run!” This series certainly sends the message that if you ever go on a dangerous adventure, it helps to have a wizard along for the journey.",

  "content": "It's one thing saying this isn't \"Lord of the Rings\" but it's quite another trying to watch without constantly comparing them. The same style of production with wonderful visual effects, Howard Shore's superb score and for much of the time it features many of the same actors from the earlier Peter Jackson trilogy. Similarly, it takes an age to get going. This first of three struggles in a different way too - there are no clearly defined roles for the characters; no \"fellowship\" if you like, for either the characters or the audience to focus on, so we are effectively starting from scratch with a whole slew of new characters whilst having to adjust to the new timelines for those we already know. Much less of a problem for those who have read the books, but for us other mortals that takes a while - and to be honest, I wasn't so impressed with the casting this time round. Martin Freeman was fine as \"Dr Watson\" in the BBC iteration of \"Sherlock\" but here, he is frankly quite annoying as \"Bilbo\". Newbie to the franchise Richard Armitage fares slightly better as Dwarf king \"Thorin\" but it is an otherwise unremarkable cast that joins Sir Ian McKellen's \"Gandalf\" as they set off to reclaim their underground kingdom of Erebor from the fearsome dragon \"Smaug\". To be fair, the story itself is not so good so the team have less to work with; and we are also now very used to the style and look of events from Middle Earth, so this was always going to make less of an impact - but the acting could have been considerably more robust. The saintly elves are bit too wholesome for me - though Cate \"loads of audio reverb\" Blanchett looks stunning as \"Galadriel\". There are plenty of evil orcs, goblins, and wargs to keep their perilous task engaging enough, though, and we are mercifully spared much of the infuriating \"Gollum\" (Andy Serkis) whom I cheered into the volcano at the end of \"Return of the King\" (2003). It is a good film, the two hours fly by and as a fan of the first trilogy, I shall stick with these - but I fear this is really a big screen experience that loses much on a smaller one with far to much dialogue and padding and not enough action.",

  "content": "Peter Jackson has always maintained that The Two Towers is \"the second act\" of his epic undertaking, and perhaps the true greatness of the middle chapter will only be clear when viewed in context. As a stand-alone film, however, The Two Towers is not quite as good as Fellowship. (Nor, indeed, does it extend the universe or deepen the relationships in the manner of The Empire Strikes Back.) That it still merits the full five stars is merely an indication of how high the benchmark has been set.\r\n\r\nPicking up pretty much where Fellowship left off, this is a considerably darker film, with Frodo (Wood) falling further under the influence of the Ring (giving rise to some seriously spooky hallucinations), while Saruman (Christopher Lee) wreaks even more havoc. There's also the first appearance of Saruman's spy, the sinister Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), and the complex Gollum, a brilliant combination of computer trickery and raspy vocals from Andy Serkis (the campaign for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar starts here).\r\n\r\nOther newcomers include Faramir (David Wenham), the understandably miffed brother of the recently deceased Boromir, and Éowyn (Miranda Otto), who spends much of her time casting winsome glances in the general direction of Aragorn (Mortensen). Eventually the plot complexities become more coherent, setting the action up for the forthcoming finale, The Return Of The King.\r\n\r\nAs we've come to expect, this is spectacular stuff - from an opening which sees Frodo troubled by dreams about the demise of Gandalf, through to the climactic Battle Of Helm's Deep, which is nothing short of breathtaking. But Jackson cleverly tempers the louder, brasher sequences with some heartstring-tugging moments - peasants despondent as they are forced to abandon their villages, Aragorn and Arwen's troubled relationship, and, of course, the return of Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen, superb as ever), one of the film's most powerful, memorable images that may well leave Ring devotees a little misty-eyed.\r\n\r\nHowever, those who still believe that the trilogy is beyond criticism may find their views challenged by The Two Towers. It's just as long as the first film, but gets the heroes no closer to a final victory. And, where the first movie developed its emotional tone from the brightness of The Shire to a darker climax, the sequel is more of a one-note affair, shadowy in both look and content.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly true of the Ringbearer's quest, which adds the not-insignifcant Gollum to the party, but suffers more than the other story strands from the cross-cutting and finishes with a nearly identical pep talk from Sam to the tearful speech that climaxed Fellowship. Of course, given the nature of the material, and Jackson's desire to be faithful, this is all understandable. And by the time we all end up under siege at Helm's Deep, it's unlikely anyone will give a toss about narrative arcs: like Gollum, this is simply gob-smacking, mind-blowing, never-seen-before stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict - It may lack the first-view-thrill and natural dramatic shape of Fellowship, but this is both funnier and darker than the first film, and certainly more action-packed. An essential component of what is now destined to be among the best film franchises of all time. \r\n\r\n5/5\r\n\r\n- Caroline Westbrook, Empire Magazine",

  "content": "That Damned Ring.\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2002 and directed by Peter Jackson, “The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers” adapts the second part of JRR Tolkien’s popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth. The surviving ‘Fellowship’ of the first film has been divided into three small groups for this one: The Hobbits Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) team-up with the mad Gollum (Andy Serkis) to make their way to Mordor, but are captured by Faramir (David Wenham), the brother of the deceased Boromir. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies) encounter the once-great King Theoden (Bernard Hill), who has fallen under the spell of Saruman (Christopher Lee) via his devious minion Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif). Meanwhile the Hobbits Pippin and Merry (Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan) try to enlist the help of huge tree creatures. Gandalf is also on hand (Ian McKellen). These story threads culminate in the great Battle at Helms Deep in the third hour.  \r\n\r\nThis three-hour fantasy/adventure starts out more engaging than the first film, which was laden by its overlong, convoluted and (for the most part) unnecessary prologue. Like that movie, the characters are colorful, the tale is imaginative, there’s a lot of brutal action rounded out by quieter moments and everything LOOKS and SOUNDS great. Unfortunately, after the first act, Jackson opts for CGI porn (excessive use of CGI with the corresponding dizzying visual effects). The first film did this too, but this one ups the ante and so there’s not as much spectacular New Zealand cinematography (i.e. real forests, mountains, rivers, etc.). If cartoony CGI is your thang then you’ll likely appreciate this installment more than me.        \r\n\r\nThere are other problems: While the characters are imaginative, they’re also shallow and rather dull, at least for mature people who require more depth to maintain their interest. Also, the wide-spanning (meandering) story with numerous characters and hard-to-remember names tends to be disengaging. I was never much captivated by the characters and their causes, although uber-fans of Tolkien might be.  \r\n\r\nAnother problem is the lack of prominent female protagonists. We have Miranda Otto as Éowyn, Théoden's niece, who falls in love with the noble Aragorn and that’s about it, except for cameos by Liv Tyler as Arwen and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel. “Mythica: A Quest for Heroes” (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $94 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the filmmakers knew enough to include a couple of prominent babes as key protagonists in the story. \r\n\r\nDespite these negatives, “The Two Towers” was an ultra-ambitious undertaking and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados who liked the first movie.                      \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours 59 minutes and was shot in New Zealand.  \r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+",

I did enjoy seeing the journey of Frodo and Sam (Sean Astin). Andy Serkis also gets more screen time with that aforementioned duo as Gollum, which is most definitely only a major positive - a fun character!

Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.",

A 163-minute runtime rarely feels this light, thanks to the contributions of the sublime cast – Hayley Atwell is outstanding – and the truly memorable score that elevates all the otherworldly set pieces.\r\n\r\nIt has the \"problem\" of being the first of two parts, with some unnatural, repetitive exposition scenes that get in the way of its progress, in addition to a somewhat generic, ambiguous narrative around A.I.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it's a summer blockbuster in its purest form, as you'd expect from the icon Tom Cruise, to whom we owe our allegiance.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

  "content": "In the interest of full disclosure, I’m often somewhat skeptical about films that include the word “part” in their titles; I frequently feel that such offerings have difficulty standing on their own, unable to complete their stories in a single vehicle. So, admittedly, that consideration was on my mind as I screened the first half of the final installment in this long-running action-adventure franchise. To its credit, director Christopher McQuarrie’s latest has a lot going for it – an intriguing plot with a strong cautionary tale message for us about the potential dangers of AI, an array of superbly staged action sequences, the welcome addition of some much-needed comic relief (something this series has often lacked) and a fine cast of supporting performers (especially the expanded role of Vanessa Kirby, who was woefully underused in the franchise’s previous release). However, with that said, there are some elements that could use improvement. For starters, the picture is simply too long; with a runtime of 2:43:00 (and this is just the first half of the story!), the film is definitely bloated and could stand some judicious editing, especially in the action sequences, several of which begin to try one’s patience after a while. Then there are certain aspects of the narrative that are predictable, formulaic, and, at times, implausible (particularly in the picture’s overlong final act train adventure sequence), qualities that are not as apparent (or at least better hidden) in previous outings. Finally, there are the underwhelming performances of the IMF crew (Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames). The leader of the pack (Cruise) comes across more like someone whose presence is designed largely to carry the plot rather than serve as a genuine, actively engaged protagonist, and his two colleagues are underused, seemingly playing sidekick roles rather than participating as key characters (unlike previous installments in the series). All told, this is by no means a bad picture, but it could have been better, especially with it being the series finale. It makes me wonder if the full story of “Dead Reckoning” might have been better executed in a single, slightly longer offering than as two separate feature-length releases. That might have solved the issues noted above, and it may have eliminated that nagging “part” problem I wrote about, allowing the picture to stand on its own two feet as a single vehicle. We’ll have to wait another year to see how it all plays out, but I can’t exactly say I’m holding my breath about it.",

  "content": "I'm not really a great fan of Tom Cruise. Yes, he does his own stunts and is as fit as a fiddle, but as an actor - well don't let's have too many scenes that require him to actually put his heart and soul into them. Luckily, there are only a few such scenes here as the rest of this is an enjoyable, quickly paced, continuation of the MI strand with this time, an elusive antagonist that reminded me a little of the \"Forbin Project\" (1970). The military have created the perfect intelligence that is locked into the sonar dome of a state-of-the-art Russian submarine. Seems though, that this dome isn't that impregnable and when a cleverly manipulated catastrophe hits the sub, it soon becomes clear that this gadget has, and is rapidly honing, a mind of it's own. The only way to stop it is to obtain the two conjoining parts of a cruciform key - and then discover the location of the sunken wreck, if there is to be any hope of thwarting it taking over the world. The story is more the stuff of \"007\", I thought, but it is a good, solid and well written story - and one that resonates well on a planet where technology and communications are pervasive across all aspects of our lives. Together with Ving Rhames and the (always annoying, sorry) Simon Pegg it falls to \"Ethan\" (Cruise) to ally with his deadly pal \"Ilsa\" (Rebecca Ferguson) and the nimble-fingered \"Grace\" (Hayley Atwell) to stop the key from falling into the hands of the enigmatic \"Gabriel\" (Esai Morales). End-to-end action; trains, planes and automobiles, parachutes and just like in \"Fast X\" (2023) poor old Rome comes in for a bit of a pasting - as does Venice and the Orient Express would now present even \"Hercule Poirot\" with an insurmountable whodunnit challenge. It's entertaining and serves well as a vehicle for the star, setting up the concluding part which, of course, leaves the plot here having to be a little undercooked and a touch predictable. Better than I was expecting and well worth a big screen outing.",

  "content": "Spectacular cinematic action let down by an incoherent story and shallow characterisations. \r\n\r\nAs is almost always the case with the MI franchise, the latest offering dishes up spectacular, highly polished, explosive action. Regrettably it comes at the price of a coherent story and rounded characterisations. \r\n\r\nThe story feels like it was made to accommodate the excess of exposition. Its a jumbled mess of poorly articulated ideas, that is, unsurprisingly, difficult to follow. Its not helped at all by an over abundance of peripheral characters. They simply add to the confused jumble and just as unsurprisingly, are never given the chance to display any depth of characterisation. \r\n\r\nThe results a film I personally found frustrating to watch. It boiled down to a series of action plot devices, including car chases and train wrecks. Certainly, some thought went into these sequences but because there is an absence of a solid story and believable characters, to cement the whole thing together, they don't amount to much, on their own.\r\n\r\nIn short, polished action but for me, lacks the key factors that bind any film together, including a decent story and characterisations. In short, I can't really recommend this one, in spite of being a fan of the franchise.",

  "content": "The Tom Cruise “Mission Impossible” franchise is one of reliable quality and equally dependable “forgettable-ness.” I’ve seen every film, yet my memory is fuzzy when I try to recall what happened in any of them. And while it’s almost a given that “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” will somehow sadly meet a similar fate, it’s still one of the best of the bunch. Not one thing disappointed me about this seventh installment in the series, an exciting and entertaining ride that gets almost everything right. This is an absolutely terrific action movie that overdelivers, and I loved every minute of it.\r\n\r\nWorld class field agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) works as a field agent for an elite, top-secret branch of the CIA called the IMF (Impossible Mission Force). His team, including associates Luther (Ving Rhames), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) have become close friends, and they’re a well-oiled machine when working together. They regroup to embark on a dangerous mission to track down a new weapon that threatens all of humanity. The entire world is at stake, and Ethan must find a device before it falls into the wrong hands while dealing with some dark skeletons of his own past.\r\n\r\nIn order to get the most enjoyment out of the film, it’s best not to read too much about the plot. What works so well about the story is that it has a modern angle, and the motivations of the villains are extremely strong. The stakes are high and there’s a very real danger, which adds to the overall excitement. As one character puts it, they’re fighting “an enemy that’s everywhere and nowhere.” It’s smart, sophisticated, and polished in a way that tends to evade your typical summer blockbuster.\r\n\r\nThere are a few high tech, double cross, master of disguise elements, but they aren’t used as a distracting gimmick (as they sometimes have been in previous MI films). The high-concept action scenes are energetic and absolutely thrilling, making for some very clever and inventive spectacles. From a dramatic footrace through the canals of Venice to motorcycle jumps in the Austrian Alps to an epic car chase through the streets of Rome, there’s never a dull moment. There’s an inspired, extended sequence on a runaway train that will go down in history as one of the most creative and fun action scenes of the year, if not ever.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of strong female characters in the story, including the new addition of Grace (Hayley Atwell), a crackerjack larcenist, and Paris (Pom Klementieff), a fierce bodyguard who gives off strong Harley Quinn vibes. This movie, simply put, is packed with badass women. Seeing the gang reunited is always fun, and Pegg and Rhames have created characters that feel like old friends. There’s excellent work from the supporting cast too (Vanessa Kirby, Esai Morales, and Shea Whigham). Cruise is starting to show his age, but he’s still one of Hollywood’s greatest working superstars. His performance is reliable, charismatic, and believable, which is exactly what it needs to be.\r\n\r\nIt’s clear that this is a movie that’s older and wiser and in turn, it’s made with more mature audiences in mind. Nothing is dumbed down, the emotional meter runs high, and the level of style and poise is unexpected and welcome (and to be commended). This is a classic espionage thriller that achieves a balance between artistry and pleasure, which is no easy feat.\r\n\r\n“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning” is the first part of a two part saga, but the finale isn’t so open-ended that it leads to frustration. Instead, it’s more of an excitement-based cliffhanger that’ll leave you salivating for the second half. This is a movie that could stand alone, but I’m awfully glad it doesn’t.",

  "content": "This is the weakest M:I movie so far, which doesn't mean it's bad but it definitely has a few critical issues. The smaller issue is the pointless action sequences. This movie has a couple of overly long sequences that drag on for way too long and serve no purpose. They bring nothing new to the table in terms of stunts and don't add anything to the story. It's just padding and noise. However, the biggest issue is the plot about artificial intelligence. The filmmakers seem very insecure about the audience's ability to understand the themes used in the story. As a result, there are multiple long scenes where characters sit in a room and repeatedly speak about certain plot elements, in different levels of detail, as if they're trying to make sure the audience understands what they're talking about. I think \"rogue computer program\" is something that most people would understand, but the movie really tries to make this concept much deeper than it needs to be for the purpose of the movie, resulting in multiple needlessly complex exposition scenes. All of this to say that the movie could have been 30 minutes shorter if you could trim the pointless action sequences and the tech jargon. As it stands, Dead Reckoning Part Two is going to have to do some very heavy lifting in order to compensate for this bloated Part One.",

  "content": "Lisa is an exchange student in London. Her affair with Matt has the urgency of the ephemeral. They are enjoying an extended, unofficial honeymoon; we see them dancing, drinking beer, doing drugs, hanging out, having irrelevant conversations and, above all, going to rock shows (all nine of the titular songs are performed live) and having sex (Matt and Lisa have intercourse the same way they talk; ie, like real human beings as opposed to movie characters).\r\n\r\nThere is generous nudity, and the sex is sometimes tentative and sometimes vigorous, and often uninhibited and experimental – as well as explicit and unsimulated (and, might I add, safe). At the same time, the songs, all except one by indie, garage, and punk rock bands (Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Elbow, Primal Scream, among others), are raw and stark, as befits a live performance (the film’s short length, a little over an hour, likewise adheres to a minimalist punk ethos).\r\n\r\nThe sex scenes follow the musical numbers, in at least one case overlapping until they merge into an audiovisual orgasm, in which the sexual act and the musical act become one, fleshing out the intangible bond that has always existed between sex and rock 'n' roll. By making Matt and Lisa the only characters with dialogue and individuality, director Michael Winterbottom makes it clear that their relationship is not just about sex; as it happens when two people fall in love (or like each other a lot), the lovers feel like the only two people on the planet, a feeling that the rest of concert-goers, a nameless and faceless mass, does nothing but emphasize.\r\n\r\nMatt is a glaciologist, and the immediacy of his passion for Lisa is contrasted with the timelessness of Antarctica (“the memory of the planet”), from where he looks back on their romance. After a year, Lisa returns to the US, and the two part without long goodbyes. This is the most realistically happy ending for a relationship, since, as we all know, the honeymoon phase is untenable and, with the passage of time, even sex becomes a chore – something like playing the same song every night.\r\n\r\nAnd sure enough, after a while, despite the musical and sexual variety – the latter of which includes cunnilingus, masturbation, blindfolds, hand tying, and manual, pedal (for lack of a better term), and vaginal sex –, the film’s structure becomes repetitive towards the end, although, once again, the brief running time keeps the tedium from becoming unbearable.",

Proper rated-R content with extremely gory, bloody action sequences, which are impressively shot and choreographed through long takes, exceptional stunt work, and surprisingly outstanding VFX. \r\n\r\nWith the help of a witty soundtrack, James Gunn brings his dark humor to an expectedly hilarious level, though not all jokes land in a still generic screenplay filled with the usual cliches and formulaic developments. Nevertheless, the phenomenal cast elevates the overall picture with fantastic performances all-around, though Daniela Melchior's breakthrough performance is an absolute standout. \r\n\r\nEach squad member receives decent screentime to share their emotionally compelling backstories, transforming a superhero movie into a character-driven story instead of just a team of superpowered nobodies beating up a random CGI monster. \r\n\r\nGunn just can't seem to miss.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B+",

  "content": "I cannot help wondering if the writer of this movie was on a LSD trip or something when he wrote it. It is over the top crazy, weird and outrageous. It is also incredibly gory. It is a super hero / bad guy comedy with emphasis on comedy. I was thinking comedy version of Kill Bill (for the gore and killing) with supers in it when I was watching it.\r\n\r\nI have to say that I enjoyed watching it though.\r\n\r\nThe movie makes absolutely no pretense of being taken seriously. The “heros” are outrageously wacky and so are most normal persons in the movie. The plot is just as wacky as the characters and this is a movie in which the normal ludicrous and illogical plot twists that the Hollywood hacks usually comes up with actually feels right for the movie.\r\n\r\nI got a bit of a what the f… moment at the beginning when the movie had but started and everything went to hell right away. That was before I had realized how much of a comedy this movie really was supposed to be. If there is a sane moment in this movie I missed it.\r\n\r\nIf there was one thing I didn’t like about the movie it was the liberal use of jumping back and forth. I hate this “24 hours earlier…” bullshit or any permutations thereof.\r\n\r\nI also really didn’t like the “It’s the evil US government conducting illegal evil experiments and we’re supposed to cover it up” story line. It just typical Hollywood overused crap.\r\n\r\nI did like the action though. As I wrote before it is ridiculously gory and very very comical. So is a lot of the dialog which of course is as crazy and weird as the rest of the movie. In any other movie as large shark with legs walking on land saying “yum yum” and then eating someone, repeatedly, would be just cringeworthy. In this movie it actually works.\r\n\r\nThe movie is 2 hours 12 minutes long and it really did not feel too long. It was 2+ hours of fun entertainment.\r\n\r\nThe post credit scene was a bit lame though. Not at the same level as the rest of the movie.",

  "content": "Ouch! Now this was always going to be a difficult story to imaginatively reimagine, and I do wonder just who Disney thought this was for as it quite radically alters the timeless fairy tale and augments it with some remarkably unremarkable power ballads and set piece choreography that wouldn’t have looked out of place at a barn dance. This iteration of the story pretty much abandons the fantasy elements of the original one and tells us of a wicked queen who has tricked her way onto the throne and turned the princess “Snow White” (Rachel Zegler) into something more akin to a royal “Cinderella”. Luckily for her, she encounters the enthusiastic bandit “Jonathan” (Andrew Burnap) who has broken into the palace to pinch some spuds, and next thing they are both trying to stay one step ahead of the Queen (Gal Gadot) who is narked  by her mirror telling her she’s just plain ugly so she wants them deceased! It does swing by the brothers Grimm every now and again, and there are seven singing dwarves to “work the whole day long”, but even they can’t breathe much life into this surprisingly mundane exercise in superb technical creativity but otherwise lacklustre amateur stage theatricals. The unmistakably familiar score from Messrs. Pasek and Paul keeps threatening to break into “You Will Be Found” from “Dear Evan Hansen” and aside from, perhaps, “Waiting on a Wish” the soundtrack - like the whole thing - is disappointingly forgettable as it avoids every potential hint of menace progressing through a fondue of gloop towards it’s conclusion. Thank heavens for “Grumpy” (Martin Kleppa) who is probably the only one on-screen in synch with those of us watching. If you do want to see it then cinema is definitely best. This will look and sound bland and forgettable on the telly, but will fit excellently with the other banal recent additions to Disney+.",

Gal Gadot is the real issue with this film. Her acting and singing is atrocious. It’s beyond me how she made it this far in Hollywood, let alone bagged this role. I think she does some type of witchcraft on the casting directors because I refuse to believe they think she’s a talented actress. Her inclusion is even worse than the CGI dwarves which I thought looked bad from the trailers but I actually grew to like them as I watched the movie, especially Dopey. He was my favourite character in the film. Overall, it was a decent film. It was only when Gal Gadot was on screen, I just sat there and cringed. There’s so many actresses that could’ve done it better.",

  "content": "<em>'Snow White'</em> is a remake worth its salt. Disney (deservedly) have a reputation for churning out remake after remake, many of which aren't necessary whatsoever. A \"reimagining\" of a 1937 movie 88 years later via a different form is, in my opinion, a perfectly logical choice of flick to redo. \r\n\r\nFor my money, this successfully improves upon <em>'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'</em>. Don't get me wrong, the original is an undeniable classic and has certain things going for it - e.g. the beautiful animation - but judging them solely as movies, this has more substance to it.\r\n\r\nI honestly don't hold any negatives for it, that isn't me saying it's a perfect film or anything close but I had a very nice time seeing it; I'd imagine it'll age well in the future, particularly for families that grow up with it. Visually, the movie looks vibrant; really colourful.\r\n\r\nThe musicial numbers are good too, I especially dug new song \"Waiting on a Wish\". Looking at their work, I do like music by Pasek and Paul. I love the soundtrack to <em>'The Greatest Showman'</em> and did enjoy what they did for <em>'Aladdin'</em>; namely \"Speechless\".\r\n\r\nAs for the cast, Rachel Zegler works as lead. I admit I had heard negative murmurs online about Zegler in the last few years back when I used Twitter properly, but in recent times I've seen some interviews and she seems cool (if clumsy?). I've watched her in a few films now and I rate her.\r\n\r\nI think Gal Gadot's Evil Queen is the weakest part, though only when compared to the rest. Gadot's performance is good, I was particularly impressed with her in terms of the music pieces. It's more so that anytime the character appears, I wasn't as interested as with SW & Co.\r\n\r\nAndrew Burnap is solid in the usual love interest sorta role. I have found the dudes in these other remakes from this company to be quite forgettable, even whilst viewing, but Burnap stood out a little more for me. Of those away from the aforementioned, Patrick Page suits his bit.\r\n\r\nThe Seven Dwarfs, to me, looked great. I do believe that having actual humans in the role would've been better, though the effects used for those characters here looked pleasant and the voice actors give more than satisfactory showings; albeit with no overt standout performer.\r\n\r\nAs alluded to above, I did hear about the many issues surrounding this release; admittedly without any deep detail. Quite the mess, it hit every branch of the way down it appears. Looking at IMDb, you think it's been review bombed by any chance? Lol. I thought IMDb fought against that sort of thing?\r\n\r\nAnyway, I really typed up nine paragraphs about this movie, huh. Well I did very much enjoy it, so... ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯",

The story of a sand paper abrasive, whiny character and a gas lighted wicked Queen, who really is \"the fairest of them all\". In fact, she's hotter than a Sydney pavement, on a summer's day. \r\n\r\nThen we have the dwarves who are no longer  quaint dwarvish people. No they are scary CGI little creatures, who look like something cooked up in Frankenstein's laboratory.\r\n\r\nTo top off the pervading sense of misery, we have a story that actually outwoke's \"wokeness\". Not an easy thing to do.\r\n\r\nThe only upside is Rachel Zegler's singing. Yeah, the girl can \"really\" carry a tune. That said, nothings going to carry this cinematic monstrosity, across the finish line.\r\n\r\nIn summary, take a look if you dare but don't say I didn't warn you first.",

  "content": "**_Refreshingly different alternative WW2 drama/adventure_**\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2009 and directed by Quentin Tarantino, \"Inglourious Basterds\" takes place during the German occupation of France in WW2 and revolves around a ruthless “Jew Hunter” Nazi (Christoph Waltz), a beautiful young theater owner dripping with vengeance, a German war hero who pesters her and a brutal team of Jewish-American guerrilla soldiers led by Lt. Aldo Raine.\r\n\r\nThis was my first taste of the popular director's eccentric repertoire, although I've since seen all of his movies. The first time I tried to watch \"Basterds\" I gave up around the 50-minute mark. Don't get me wrong, the dialogue-driven opening sequence is great but the film seemed to bog down with its focus on a French theater during the German occupation and the accompanying interminable dialogue (mostly in subtitles). I just wasn't ready for this because I was expecting a Dirty Dozen-styled WW2 film with lots of action and all that goes with it. What I got instead was a plot that focused on the aforementioned theater accompanied by long sessions of generally subtitled dialogue.\r\n\r\nI eventually gave it a second chance with the understanding that this wasn't some typical war flick. Strangely, the \"interminable dialogue\" pulled me in and I slowly became engrossed in the story, which isn't hard to follow. The drama is only occasionally interrupted by flashes of extreme violence. Until the end, that is, where all hell literally breaks loose.\r\n\r\nThere ARE elements that bring to mind \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967), including a group of anti-heroes intent on mercilessly obliterating as many Germans as possible and the fact that the real action doesn't kick-in until the final act, but \"Basterds\" is hardly a Dirty Dozen clone. It may borrow a bit from notable films of the past but it absolutely possesses its own refreshing originality.\r\n\r\nAll effective films have quality characters and \"Basterds\" has several: The stunning Mélanie Laurent as Shosanna, the cinema proprietor who quietly seethes with retribution; Christoph Waltz as SS Col. Hans Landa, an articulate and suave love-to-hate villain who mercilessly hunts down Jews; Brad Pitt as the almost-comical, but no-nonsense leader of the brutal Basterds; super-sharp Diane Kruger as a German actress & British spy; and Daniel Brühl as a genial German hero with the hots for the beautiful Shosanna.\r\n\r\nLike Tarantino’s other great movies (“Pulp Fiction,” “Django Unchained” and “Jackie Brown”), \"Basterds\" pulsates with confidence, style, quirkiness and a sense of the unexpected from beginning to end, the perfect antidote to the idiotic \"blockbuster\" syndrome that plagues modern cinema with its predictability and overKILL action & CGI, etc. Most movies seem like they’re in a rush and shy away from extended dialogues because they fear losing the viewer’s limited attention whereas Tarantino makes them a highlight because it’s an area where he excels. Instead of pedestrian verbiage that merely advances the plot or conveys the obvious, his interchanges are rich with amusement and mindfood.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 153 minutes and was shot in France and Germany.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-",

The final scene, as oddly over the top as it is, shows the promise.\r\n\r\nPaul Rudd and Jenna Ortega are decent in their respective roles, not that I have any core moments to take from either of them here though.

  "content": "There is something disappointingly formulaic about this comedy drama that really never quite comes alive. It doesn’t start so promisingly as we meet “Elliot” (Paul Rudd) who is travelling with his estranged teenage daughter “Ridley” (Jenny Ortega) to the remote wilderness home of his would-be benefactors whom he is hoping will give him power of attorney over a large lump of cash. “Odell” (Richard E. Grant) is the patriarch, and on his last legs; “Belinda” (Téa Leoni) is his wife and “Shep” (Will Poulter) his sharp as a spoon son - and “Elliott” is out to impress. Thing is, he is very late for their appointment. Why? Well they hit something on the road to the house and, well it isn’t the kind of thing you meet on the road every day - even if you are Tom Cruise. They assume this critter is no more, so imagine their surprise when it starts to make it’s presence felt in their host’s car park! A bit of research reveals not just what this is, but also that it’s blood could have miraculous healing powers (think phoenix’s tears). Could this be the miracle cure old “Odell” is looking for? Well more likely it is the source of grief for all concerned when it’s mum and dad realise it’s not come home to their cave for supper and set off, quite angrily, to retrieve their offspring. The story tries to introduce a little elemental fantasy to the proceedings, but with the possible exception of Leoni who seems to be prepared to go with the joke, the others aren’t really at the races. Grant resorts to uber-ham mode, Poulter tries but has little to work with and neither Rudd nor Ortega do much with this “Bambi” does “Jurassic Park” enterprise. There’s a fun role for Anthony Carrigan as their “Lurch” style factotum “Griff” - the only one in the whole thing who might actually have a brain, but otherwise this is all a triumph for girth over substance. It’s perfectly watchable, but not a film I expect to recall for long.",

This one has waited twice that time for a sequel that is perfectly watchable, but boy is it wordy! Dad \"Bob\" swaps roles with wife \"Helen\" (aka \"Elastigirl\") only to find that it's she who falls foul of the latest government anti-superhero regulations. Fortunately, the wealthy \"Deavor\" brother and sister act have a cunning plan to reverse these publicity disasters and restore the public confidence in our lycra-clad citizens. The remainder of this film follows rather procedural lines. Dad has fun managing the increasingly active \"Jack-Jack\" (and his entertaining new powers) whilst mum has to combat the new enemy \"Screenslaver\" who has some fairly formidable mind-control skills which he intends to use for, of course, world domination. As a role reversal comedy, the dad definitely gets the better, and funnier, end of the stick. As an adventure film, though, it's all just a bit 'been there got the T-shirt' and there is nowhere near enough action to sustain the almost two hours of screen time. The animation and score work well, though, and even if it's not really a patch on the first one, it's still an easy watch.",

At ten minutes shy of three hours the story just isn't substantial enough to sustain it and I must confess to finding my attention dwindling a bit at various stages of the proceedings. Thankfully, Geoffrey Rush has rejoined the cast as the whole ensemble must now risk life and limb - and sail to the very edge of the world - to save \"Jack\" (Johnny Depp) from oblivion and thwart the seemingly unstoppable \"Lord Beckett\" (Tom Hollander). How to do this? Well they must galvanise the entire global pirate community and that means the dreaded \"Sao Feng\" (Chow Yun-Fat), \"Capt. Teague\" (the one and only Keith Richards) and a consortium of the most corrupt, venal and treacherous folks ever put on Earth. This time, though, it is \"Elizabeth\" (Keira Knightley) who steps up to the plate and demonstrates that she has come a long way since she was kidnapped from her father's home just a few short years ago to become a true kick-ass captain in her own right. This has much less of a story than the first two films; it sort of rehashes the tail end of the story from \"Dead Man's Chest\" (2006) just a bit too much and although the visual effects are superb, as usual, the whole thing just looked more like a victory for the marketing executives than the creative ones at Disney. The last half hour is all good fun, though, with a denouement that we could have had half an hour earlier and that would have served as a fitting conclusion to the adventures of this disparate band of pirates, lovers and scaly monsters. It's still watchable, but I fear this is all a bit tired and Verbinski et al are really struggling for that innovation that we have seen before.",

How thick can that critter be? Then to make matters worse, a royal herald arrives to invite them all to the castle for a state banquet to celebrate their recent nuptials. Thing is, neither parent knows that \"Fiona\" has now gone the turned into an ogre! Unsurprisingly, the King and Queen don't quite take this in their stride and after some initially polite protocol it's pretty much open warfare. Meantime, the pretty hapless \"Prince Charming\" still has a bit of a crush on the princess and so connives with the not so benign \"Fairy Godmother\" to upset their apple-cart of domestic bliss. Now there's no getting away from it for me, I am not a fan of Eddie Murphy in just about any of his guises, and here his interpretation of the annoying donkey does just that - and after about ten minutes of the relentless (unfunny) prattle, I'd have happily paid for him to go to a sanctuary, ideally on the moon. The rest of this is quite entertaining though, with loads of mischief and calamity ensuing as this family has to learn that it's not all about appearances. Judge folks on their actions and who they are and maybe you'll discover that being big and rough round the edges is no bad thing. The suave and debonaire \"Puss In Boots\" steals the thing for me and I did enjoy the idea of the anti-fairy wreaking mischief and not so much cheesy joy. There's plenty in the script for the grown ups as well as for the kids and I thought this almost as good as the first one (2001). Good fun.",

Statham adopts a rather curious accent throughout this totally unoriginal and derivative action thriller that gets gradually more preposterous as it goes on. Josh Hutcherson and Jeremy Irons add a little box-office to the thing, but their roles are undercooked and the former is actually pretty hopeless throughout. Some fun pyrotechnics and you wouldn't ever want to mess with \"Clay\" but these one-man assassination squad movies are ten a penny now and this is certainly not one of the best.",

The editing, action and score are positives, though everything around those aforementioned elements is annoyingly very hit-and-miss... and I'm not sure how much the other bits affect my enjoyment.\r\n\r\nAway from the great Statham, the cast are also up-and-down. Josh Hutcherson and Jeremy Irons are decent, I think inferior actors would've done much worse so those two do do well in fairness. Sadly, for Emmy Raver-Lampman & Co. on the FBI side of the story... not the best. I mean, they're OK but kinda boring at the same time.\r\n\r\nRaver-Lampman's character is also quite lamely written, not the actress' fault of course but still. Without spoiling anything, I feel like her character should've been way more sympathetic to Clay's cause given the obvious - like, still 'do your job' absolutely but it's as if the character forgot what happened at the start of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe scummy organizations are also portrayed a bit too cartoony, based on what I've seen in real life about those sorta people is that they're usually lousy losers who happen to know how to do what they do - rather than 'Gen Z' (please do forgive me for using that term *shudder*) smartasses who party 24/7 as this 2024 release shows.\r\n\r\nI'm happy with the rating I've settled on, Statham merited more though.",

  "content": "**The Beekeeper** is a serviceable action thriller that delivers what you would expect from a _Jason Statham_ vehicle: brutal fights, cheesy one-liners, and a simple revenge plot. The film is directed by David Ayer, who has a knack for creating gritty and violent urban settings, and written by Kurt Wimmer, who has a penchant for crafting absurd and convoluted sci-fi scenarios. The result is a mashup of John Wick, The Equalizer, and The Matrix, with a dash of bee-related humor and symbolism.\r\n\r\n**Statham** plays _Adam Clay_, a reclusive beekeeper who lives on a farm owned by his elderly friend _Eloise Parker_ (**Phylicia Rashad**). When Eloise falls victim to a phishing scam orchestrated by a sinister tech company, Adam decides to use his skills as a former elite operative to track down and punish the culprits. Along the way, he encounters various obstacles and enemies, such as corrupt cops, hired goons, and a mysterious hacker known as The Queen (Ruby Rose). He also forms an unlikely alliance with Eloise's daughter, FBI agent Sarah Parker (**Emmy Raver-Lampman**), who is investigating the same case.\r\n\r\nThe film does not waste much time on exposition or character development, focusing instead on the action sequences and the spectacle. Statham is in his element as the stoic and efficient killing machine, dispatching his foes with a variety of weapons and martial arts moves. He also delivers some witty and sarcastic remarks, often involving bees or honey. The supporting cast is mostly forgettable, except for Rashad, who brings some warmth and dignity to her role, and Rose, who plays the villain with a mix of charm and menace.\r\n\r\nThe film's biggest flaw is its lack of originality and coherence. The plot is a generic and predictable revenge story, with some implausible twists and turns. The film also tries to incorporate some themes and messages about technology, society, and morality, but they are either underdeveloped or contradictory. For example, the film seems to criticize the dangers of data mining and online fraud, but also glorifies the use of hacking and surveillance by the protagonist. The film also uses the bee motif as a metaphor for Adam's identity and mission, but it is often inconsistent and superficial.\r\n\r\nThe Beekeeper is not a film that will challenge or surprise you, but it is a film that will entertain you if you are in the mood for some mindless and fun action. It is a popcorn flick that knows its strengths and limitations, and delivers on its promise of Statham kicking ass and cracking jokes. If you are a fan of his previous works, or of the action genre in general, you will probably enjoy this film. Just don't expect anything more than that.",

  "content": "I have to be honest and say that, if far left Hollywood had not turned out one woke turd after another but actually good movies as they used to a long time ago, this one might not have earned five out of five stars from me.\r\n\r\nBut since the Hollywood pedophiles have more or less ruined everything they touch the competition for good movies is more or less non-existent so here we go.\r\n\r\nThe movie is pretty much free of woke bullshit and far left preaching so that alone earns it at least two stars.\r\n\r\nThis movie is very much a John Wick style movie. Some dumbass criminals piss off the wrong guy and a fireworks display of martial arts and dead criminals follows.\r\n\r\nJason Statham, as Adam Clay aka The Beekeeper, is really at his best in this movie. He is a kick-ass, relentless, stone hard, killer focused on both revenge and the eradication of the human scum that preys on the weak and, in this case, stupid.\r\n\r\nThe bad guys, at least at the start, is an organization that runs on-line scams. When scamming the person that has taken Adam under her wings after his retirement it has unforeseen and tragic consequences.\r\n\r\nLater in the movie this simple plot evolves, as the blurb states, to a national emergency due to the corrupt and criminal actors involved at high levels.\r\n\r\nWhen I watched the movie I really thought that this entire scamming things was a bit unrealistic. I mean come on, people cannot be that stupid! But then I reminded myself that people also, allegedly, voted for a senile turnip brain with a kackling moron as vice president so I guess they can be.\r\n\r\nAs I wrote, Statham is really at his best. If we should compare with John Wick again, Statham is much more menacing and vengeful than Keanu Reeves ever was in John Wick.\r\n\r\nI really like how the criminal asshats at all levels gradually gets their rightful, and usually terminal, punishment and that they most of the time gets to see and sweat as their doom approaches.\r\n\r\nAlso, the stunts are not at all as exaggerated and ludicrous as in the fourth John Wick installment. That does not mean that they are very realistic but then that is not really to be expected in this kind of action movie.\r\n\r\nThe story overall is not bad. It is an action movie type of story which means it is fairly simplistic, it has plot holes and it is not overly realistic but that is fine. It is good enough and it is Statham that carries the movie anyway.\r\n\r\nThis was indeed one of the best movies in a long time as far as I am concerned. Pure entertainment.\r\n\r\nShare this:",

  "content": "First of all, I love the animation style in this film. The animation in this film is styled to look like an actual comic book. I think this approach for this kind of film was an excellent choice because we’ve all seen the usual kind of animation but nothing like this. To tie in with the animation I need to talk about the action scenes in this film. These tie in with the animation because of the way the directors styled the action shots is to look like something in a comic panel. Most people don’t know who Miles Morales is and after this film, you’ll want to learn more about him because of how they made him so relatable in this film. He acts like a typical teen in this situation compared to other versions of Spider-Man. Other versions kind of just acted like they always knew how to use their powers when Miles struggles with his. Miles isn’t the only relatable character film all of them are. The creators of this film did a “Marvel”ous job at making each character in this film somebody at least one person in the audience can relate to. All of the voice actors did a great job in their respected roles but it would’ve been nice to have a returning voice to at least one of the Spider-Man. It would’ve been cool to hear a returning voice even if it was for a few seconds. I have to talk about the humour in this film. It isn’t overpowered in this film and I felt like it had just the right amount of humour that will make everybody laugh. They poke fun of things that wouldn’t make sense in a real movie and other Spider-Man movies. Not a single moment in this film felt rushed or slowed down every scene felt the right pace for a movie like this. The cinematography in this movie was spectacular. This is probably because of it looking like a comic book and how the lighting needs to match up with how it would look in an actual book. If you are a comic book junkie you’ll love all of the easter eggs in this film. Some of them just comic book readers will get but others a majority of people will understand. The music in this film is fantastic. Every song in this film isn’t overused and matches perfectly with the age of the character. Somebody Miles age would be listening to the type of music he listens to. And the music without lyrics helps increase the emotion in the film. Also, there are two end credit scenes that are worth waiting for. In the end, this film is perfect for everybody. I give Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse a 10/10.",

  "content": "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) is no ordinary Spider-Man movie, it contains multiple characters with the same powers in multiple dimensions.\r\n This is also not an ordinary animated movie. It has animated style we have never seen before. There were 177 animators and it took 1 week to animate 1 second and 1 year to nail down 10 seconds. Nowadays, animations are being made to look real but this movie was different. However, the creators wanted it to look like something new for viewers. They don't make it realistic or cartoon. The creators used an old-school technique called \"smear\". If you look in a single frame, you'll notice things like multiple limbs to create the illusion of movement. Basically, the entire movie was a comic book that moves. There is a technique in half-toning, which uses dots to create colors and gradients. They were really jaw-dropping. The shadows were created with hatching or crisscrossed lines. The movie had some textures so it would be exactly like a comic and I was glad that it deserved Oscars's Best Animated Feature. All of these techniques combined to make a movie that was the best animated feature not just in 2018 but perhaps of all time. It was really like a masterpiece of animation!\r\n The story plot was really good. The scenes were quite EPIC and sometimes tragic and hilarious. The unbelievable thing was when Peter Parker died in Miles' Dimension. It was really sad to see an iconic superhero killed by a supervillain. The deaths are moving and the hilarious scenes kept me laugh a lot. I like the end-credits when it started in the Animated Tv Show Spider-Man (1966) when the two Spider-Men look exactly like each other arguing, but this time, it was Spider-Man pointing to Spider-Man 2099. How did they do that? Perhaps the best moment to me was “A Leap of Faith” when Miles tried to be the one and only Spider-Man in his dimension, after Peter Parker was dead.\r\nI wasn't bored watching this movie, it kept my eyes open on the screen looking at the newest kind of animation. I was totally impressed! Perhaps this is the greatest animated movie of alll time! It was a really good idea to release this on Christmas!",

The industry goes wild for this news and when he announces his own version of a golden ticket and invites a select group to join him for an exclusive get together at his ranch, the enthusiast journalist “Ariel” (Ayo Edebiri) accompanies her limelight hogging boss to this ultimate weekend. Of course, as soon as she arrives she finds the place akin to a cult. Loads of almost automaton acolytes, some cruelly painful oyster shucking and loads of sexually fluid flamboyance from their host all starts to get her heckles up and gradually we become aware that their is an altogether ulterior motive for this carefully contrived fine dining experience. When one of their number goes missing, well things rapidly speed to a denouement that is straight out of Agatha Christie. The point it makes in the end is actually quite a clever one, but the rest of this is all derivative and simplistic. Why were this group selected? Who are they? What have they in common with each other or with their antagonist? For something that’s supposed to be random and spontaneous, the entire plot depends on characters making very specific (and not always the most natural of) choices en route. Malkovich does stand out, but that might also be as much to do with the really mediocre writing and the remainder of the cast delivering a very join-the-dots performance. Sadly, this is nothing original nor special and really disappoints.",

  "content": "Director Mark Anthony Green’s “Opus” is an ambitious but uneven satirical horror-thriller that bites off more than it can chew. Centered on a young journalist named Ariel (Ayo Edebiri) who is invited to the secluded desert compound of a legendary pop star (John Malkovich) long thought to be missing, the film attempts to explore themes of celebrity worship, journalistic ethics, and the cult of fame. Unfortunately, despite its lofty aspirations, it never fully delivers on its big ideas.\r\n\r\nThe cast is terrific, and their hard work keeps everything from sinking completely. Edebiri is so relatable (and quite funny) as a rookie writer caught in a surreal and sinister game, while Malkovich (who is perfectly cast here) fully leans into his enigmatic, manipulative role. Their dynamic crackles with potential, making it even more rewarding to watch as the cast of supporting characters (an entourage of sycophantic followers and inebriated journalists) are picked off one by one despite the warnings from Ariel that something is just not right.\r\n\r\nThere are moments of sharp and inspired satire, especially in the exaggerated, synth-laden musical interludes that showcase the absurdity of celebrity culture. The lavish parties, meals, and activities are fun until they aren’t. The eventual discomfort of a reveal and bloody violence that follows is equal parts shocking and hysterical, and all of the film’s more outrageous moments at least feel earned.\r\n\r\nDespite getting a lot of things right, the film suffers from an identity crisis. It wants to be a biting critique of pop culture obsession, a psychological thriller, and an eerie horror film all at once, but it never quite lands any of these elements in a satisfying way. Green sets up intriguing ideas but doesn’t develop them meaningfully. Not only does the tension never really escalate, but it culminates in an ending that feels like an epic letdown of an afterthought instead of a deliciously wicked payoff.\r\n\r\nIn the end, “Opus” isn’t as clever as it thinks it is (or as it wants so desperately to be). It flirts with brilliance, but settles for just being merely okay.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

  "content": "**_A Masterpiece of Cinematic Art -- Captivating and Reverent_**\r\n\r\nThe head Death Row guard at a Tennessee prison during the Depression (Tom Hanks) observes a new inmate, a black man named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), who is condemned to death for the rape and murder of two little girls. He and his fellow guards become intrigued by the gentle giant and conclude that there's no way he could be guilty of the crime. Who, then, is guilty? And will the guilty party get away with it.\r\n\r\n\"The Green Mile\" expertly mixes film genres: It's part prison flick, part supernatural mystery and part drama. It was adapted from Stephen King's novel by director/writer Frank Darabont and released in 1999. If you're not an admirer of Stephen King books/films (I'm not), DON'T let that deter you from viewing this beautiful and spiritually-profound film; it's by no means a typical horror story, although it does have a couple of horrific scenes.\r\n\r\nRunning 3-hours, it's over my limited attention span, and yet it's somehow utterly engrossing, even on repeat viewings. It's character/dialogue driven, unique and unpredictable. Don't mistake this for a run-of-the-mill prison flick. The fact that it largely takes place in a prison in the 1930s is a secondary issue. This is a powerful supernatural mystery/drama.\r\n\r\n**SPOILER ALERT** (Don't read this next paragraph unless you want to consider possibilities about the character John Coffey)\r\n\r\nJohn Coffey's last name is, evidently, derived from an ancient Sumerian word, kophi, which means \"winged creature.\" Hence, John could be viewed as a angel or messenger from the Almighty. Actually, John is a type of Jesus Christ verified in six ways: (1) His initials are JC. (2) He's good-hearted and can easily recognize true evil. (3) He miraculously heals people. (4) He pronounces and executes divine judgment. (5) He is sacrificed even though completely innocent. And (6) He offers eternal life (in a sense), as evidenced by the extended life-span of the Hanks character and the mouse \"Mr. Jingles.\"\r\n\r\n**End SPOILER ALERT**\r\n\r\nDon't miss out on this cinematic masterpiece.",

He's a decent man who, with the help of his partner \"Howell\" (David Morse) tries to carry out his task as humanely as possible. Their team also numbers the truly odious \"Percy\" (Doug Hutchinson). He's an incompetent coward, but he also happens to be the nephew of the state governor, so tends to get away with his obnoxiousness towards the prisoners. That nasty behaviour becomes more pronounced when the giant \"Coffey\" (Michael Clarke Duncan) arrives. Also newly arrived is a small mouse which befriends, much to the chagrin of \"Percy\", a fellow inmate (Harry Dean Stanton) and oddly enough it seems to help keep the peace as people come and go. Things take quite an intriguing turn when some physical contact between their gentle giant and \"Edgecomb\" seems to cure his liver complaint. As the officer realises that this man may well possess healing hands, he and his team begins to bond with him. Meantime, the ghastly little \"Percy\" screws up his first execution causing an effect straight out of a Wes Craven film and Sam Rockwell's psychopathic \"Wild Bill\" arrives to liven things up. It's actually Rockwell who steal this for me. His performance is viscerally effective and he really does commit to the role. It's over 3 hours long but the acting is almost perfect as these characters develop and the story unfolds reconciling the brutality of racism, crime and punishment with the attempts at humanity and decency applied by virtually everyone whose lives are touched by these scenarios - even amongst the staff who struggle at times to keep their own priorities in kilter. One of Stephen King's much better stories with depth to the personas, a good baddie to loathe and a message of redemption delivered subtly but powerfully.",

With a clear distinction between being \"good\" and \"bad\", stereotypes and preconceived notions are brilliantly addressed in a sweet redemption story that doesn't try to reinvent the wheel.\r\n\r\nThe voice cast is exceptional, elevating an admittedly formulaic narrative in a remarkably impactful manner. Despite being more geared towards children, the entertainment levels are high enough for any generation. The blend of 2D and 3D animation works flawlessly, offering an overall distinct look compared to what audiences are used to.\r\n\r\nIn the end, it's yet another recommendation for families.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B",

  "content": "The epic Marvel Saga that started over ten years ago has been building up to the inevitable clash with the powerful tyrant Thanos (Josh Brolin).  Last year’s “Avengers: Infinity War” set the stage for the highly-anticipated conclusion; “Avengers: End Game” and at long last it has arrived.\r\n\r\nPicking up shortly after the events of the last film, the Avengers must deal with the aftermath of what Thanos has done. The team is naturally divided between wanting revenge, wanting to set things right, and just wanting to take what they have and go on. \r\n\r\nAs time passes and they struggle to accept the reality of their situation; an unexpected individual returns and with them comes the seeds of a new plan to make things right. Naturally Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is skeptical but eventually warms to the possibilities of the idea thanks to a new scientific breakthrough that makes it possible.\r\n\r\nInspired, Tony sets out to put an elaborate plan in motion that will allow the team to try to fix things and to stop Thanos once and for all.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is an extended and at times nostalgic heist where various members of the team work to assemble the pieces needed for the plan as they believe they only have one chance to make things right.\r\n\r\nThe film is essentially three acts in one. The first deals with the recap and expansion of their situation and the planning. The second act is basically a heist where action and comedy are blended with some touching moments.\r\n\r\nThis all leads to the final act which is the FX laden set piece where the ensemble cast gathers to fight the forces of evil in a battle to save the Universe.\r\nThe film is epic in scale and length as it clocks in at over three hours but the movie is filled with so much content that the time goes by quickly and you have a hard time believing three hours have elapsed.\r\n\r\nIt is also a difficult film to review as you cannot recap elements of the film in any great detail without giving away elements that are sure to delight the fans. Suffice it to say that my only real issue with the fil and it was minor; was that it took a while to get to the action but at least there was plenty to keep you entertained along the way.\r\n\r\nAs this phase of the Marvel Film Universe winds down and plans are put in place for the next five years; “Avengers: End Game” is a satisfying conclusion to the epic saga that was started many years ago and weaves elements of many of the past Marvel films into an entertaining tale which features all of the best elements that have made the series of films such big hits.\r\n\r\n4.5 stars out of 5",

  "content": "Hey, so, just some really quick thoughts I wanna get down, 'cause it's after 1 o'clock in the morning, and I wanna get some sleep so I can wake up well rested to see _Endgame_ again.\r\n\r\nPutting it out there right from the get-go, _Avengers: Endgame_ is my favourite MCU movie. It's my favourite movie of the year too, but I've only seen like ten or so 2019 releases, and this is the 22nd Marvel Cinematic Universe film, so that seems far and away the bigger deal. I can't say it's perfect, there's some conflicting stuff within its own runtime that really doesn't seem to gel (though a re-watch may prove me wrong on that), and it's not like every moment was the no-holds-barred-zero-exception best version of that moment from start to end. But God I loved this thing.\r\n\r\nI will say this though, the reason that I loved it, is this thing is fan service galore. If you do not care for the franchise's 21 movies preceding this point, then _Endgame_ is not the movie to turn you around on that. That may come in a future installment, but this one is a culmination. It's the end of _Infinity War_ but also Phase 3, but also a wrap-up and genuine ode to/send off for everything that Marvel has done over the past 11 years. That to me was incredible, and I am eternally greatful, but I cannot imagine it working for people who have no vested interest in these characters.\r\n\r\nTo me though? My first 9 out of 10 rating in **three years**.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★★★½ - Ridiculously strong appeal. I can’t stop thinking about it._",

  "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nDon't worry. This is going to be a pretty vague review. Right now, as I'm writing this sentence, I'm still processing what I saw and how am I going to explain how I felt without spoiling a single tiny thing. First of all, it's such a mix of feelings. On one hand, I'm extremely happy that I was lucky to be alive during this epic time and that I was able to follow these characters that I love and care about so much. On the other hand, I'm obviously sad that it finally reached the end of this (hopefully) first incredible saga. There are no perfect films and one with so many heroes will always have struggles balancing it all (Infinity War already had this issue). \r\n\r\nHowever, the Russo brothers did everything they could to deliver a phenomenal story, and they did. I don't think this could have been any better. Its last hour exceeds any expectations. It's epic, emotional, action-heavy, and it has one of my favorite shots in the entire history of cinema. It's pure magic, and the VFX team will surely get an Oscar for it. The action reminded me of the biggest Lord of the Rings' battles, and it was impeccably filmed, filled with riveting and chill-inducing sequences. Nevertheless, don't expect this high-intensity feeling throughout the whole runtime. The other two acts are a slow-burn build-up to a payoff that's going to make you pretty much either \"love\" or \"like\" this movie. I absolutely love it! \r\n\r\nThis is easily one of the best MCU films, if not my new number one. I can't deny that the 3-hour runtime has some unnecessary scenes, but even if they don't have a significant impact on the plot or even in the characters, they still contribute to the enormous build-up. Seeing this family that we grew up with just talking with each other or having lunch, at the same time that they deal with the consequences of Thanos' snap, is inexplicably captivating and heartwarming. Characters like Natasha (Scarlett Johansson) and Steve (Chris Evans) supporting each other is simply beautiful. Their comradery and chemistry are worthy of some tears here and there.\r\n\r\nSome people didn't really enjoy Infinity War so much due to the lack of screentime that some characters had. This time around, there are fewer characters to work with, so the balance is better. Everyone gets an important role, from Captain America to Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) to Nebula (Karen Gillan), and even Rocket (Bradley Cooper). Every single character has a major moment. If you take one out of the movie, it just doesn't work anymore. This is not only great work from the directors, but also from the writers. \r\n\r\nChristopher Markus and Stephen McFeely are not even going to be remembered because fans will always think of the cast first. Most of them will also remember the directors. But the writers?! If I stand at the door of the theater at the end of the film and question everyone about who are the writers, I strongly believe most of the audience won't know. Every dialogue, every sentence, every word carries so much impact on the narrative. Literally, I cried and got chills just by hearing two freaking words with the perfect timing in between. The amount of grief that the words of the ones who've lost everyone and everything carry is palpable and, for me, those are the most emotional moments of the movie: seeing how everyone is suffering from their own losses, not the deaths themselves.\r\n\r\nThe humor is mostly on-point, but it's still connected to my only real issue with the film, which is the second act's tone. From the moment the team decides what to do, we already know that this is a 1 in 14 million chance of success like Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) said, so the stakes and pressure are massive! With this level of tension, I didn't expect such an “easygoing” and “funny” vibe throughout, except for one particular sequence. They do a great job once again of pairing up certain Avengers together, but most of them go through these too comedic plot points for such a crucial and serious mission. Fortunately, this act carries enough action and emotional drive to make this problem not that big of an issue.\r\n\r\nVisually, this is arguably the best-looking superhero film ever. From the mind-blowing visual effects to the gorgeous cinematography, everything is perfect. The costumes are gritty and muddy when our heroes are in a battle, their faces are all filled with blood, and I have no words to describe how jaw-dropping that last act is. I can't wait to change my desktop wallpaper once THAT shot is available. I dropped a single tear just by looking at it. No one talks, no one does anything. It's just an amazingly beautiful image. The score is epic as hell. So much that I'm listening to it right now as I'm writing this review, and I'm getting chills all over my body. \r\n\r\nI can't really write much more, to be honest. I will acknowledge the cast because they are brilliant. Each and every single member delivers an outstanding performance, but if I had to choose the ones that both surprised me and had the most impact on me, they would be Johansson's, Evans', and Robert Downey Jr's (Tony Stark / Iron Man). “New” characters like Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) blend seamlessly, and the payoff is unbelievably satisfying. In terms of predictability, it goes more or less as I expected, but it still carries a few surprises throughout. Nothing is ever like we imagine or theorize about, so expect the unexpected, and don't judge a movie by if it fits your crazy, unrealistic theories that never crossed the producers and directors' minds in the first place!\r\n\r\nAll in all, I don't know what to do now. The only thing I'm sure of is that I want to see it again, as soon as possible. The last hour is f*cking insane. I couldn't fall asleep properly because I couldn't stop thinking about it. Endgame surpasses all expectations. It's everything I wished for and so much more. I could easily spend a whole day at the movie theater and watch three sessions in a row. It's that good. One of the best comic-book films of all-time, without a single doubt. Thank you to Kevin Feige and everyone who worked hard to bring the MCU to where it stands now. I can't even think of how are they going to produce something at the level of Infinity Saga. Maybe they never will. Maybe we'll have to wait another decade or two for something like this. Until then, see you at the next Endgame screening! Enjoy! Oh and #DontSpoilTheEndgame!\r\n\r\nPS: it's not a perfect movie, I know. It doesn't exist one. Yes, Endgame has some issues regarding its pacing and tone, but I would be lying to myself if this isn't everything I dreamed of. I felt the same way with Civil War, regarding the rating to give, and I ended up giving it an A after a first viewing. As soon as I watched the second time, I changed it to an A+. I don’t need to wait for that second viewing with Endgame … And thank you to my audience for being incredibly respectful. No yelling, no crazy laughs, no stupid people doing stupid stuff. Thank you so much for not ruining one of the best cinematic experiences of my life!\r\n\r\nRating: A+",

  "content": "These kind of movies are among the few movies that I can be bothered to go to an actual theater to watch nowadays. For most movies I just wait until they come out on disk (preferably Ultra HD Blu-ray if it’s available) and watch them on my home theater rig. So this weekend me and the kids went to the theater to watch Avengers: Endgame.\r\n\r\nI have to say that it was better, even much better, than I feared. I really feared that the SJW retards at Marvel would take this opportunity to completely re-organize the Marvel universe to their liking. Like how they completely ruined both professor Xavier and Wolverine in that abysmal Logan movie. Luckily, this did not really happen. Maybe the financial reality of their failing SJW comics and Disney doing a bit of culling of the most extreme of the Marvel retards, the ones who fail to understand that super hero movies are meant to entertain and not be their personal agenda channel, are starting to take effect.\r\n\r\nIt was actually a quite good movie with plenty of action, some humor and, of course, lots and lots of special effects. Even the story made somewhat sense, at least in the context of a Marvel movie, even though the writers resorted to time travel.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts of somewhat dark and grim but I guess that was to be suspected. It cheered up as it moved along and then ending … well to me at least it was mostly satisfactory.\r\n\r\nI was not too thrilled about the “new” Hulk although I warmed up to him a bit during the film. Thor? The less that is said about him the better actually. The rest of the merry bunch was in pretty good shape and I am quite happy that we did not get to see to much of Quill’s usual shenanigans. I really hate that character.\r\n\r\nI was quite positively surprised at the huge and quite cool battle towards the end. I was thinking, or rather hoping,  that at some time they were just going to reverse Thanos’ crap and that would be it but instead we get to watch another huge confrontation with pretty much everyone involved at the end. Very cool action and FX indeed.\r\n\r\nThere were some silly plot holes of course. As always when writers resort to time travel. An obvious one would of course be that, when they knew they only had enough Pym particles to complete one trip for each person why did they just not go back in time to get more the first thing they did? Especially since they later did exactly that. Also, Captain Marvel (in her new SJW hairdo) flies through a barrage of fire, smashes through Thanos’ ship like it was nothing and then struggles to combat Thanos himself? There were a bit of this silliness spread around but not too much for me to be bothered by it.\r\n\r\nThere were a few casualties of which I am saddened by two of them. I think at least one of them was unnecessary and probably agenda based. I also strongly disliked the rubbish with Captain America at the end. He has never been one of my favorite characters so I do not really care much about him being around or not but that rubbish sob-scene where he hands over his shield to a “politically correct” person was really unnecessary. I guess it must have been put there to appease the Marvel SJW retards.\r\n\r\nAnyway, my bottom line is that I was greatly entertained by this movie. It had all the good stuff, real super heroes, action, special effects and not too much of the crap that has been spewing out of Marvel the last years.",

My wife & I had this discussion before viewing. It basically comes down to two options (assuming the events in \"Infinity War\" weren’t just a dream): magic or time travel. All I’ll say is: What they came up with was in ways reminiscent of the plot convolutions of \"Back to the Future II\" (1989).\r\n\r\n“Endgame” (2019) begins strong with the devastating reality of half of all living beings in the Universe suddenly vanishing. It starts to get lethargic about an hour in, but perks up with the three teams trying to apprehend the Infinity Stones so they can maybe reverse what happened at the end of the previous film.\r\n\r\nEverything naturally leads to a huge battle in the last hour that I found boring, not to mention that the epilogue tended to drag on with too much of it being tedious. Still, there are lots of worthy bits throughout, like the opening, the unpredictable first encounter with Thanos, Thor getting flabby, the moving match between Black Widow and Hawkeye at the cliff’s edge, and much more. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the myriad protagonists work against the film because it can’t concentrate on any one or two characters for very long. Captain Marvel is short shifted and decidedly dull. Plus the movie’s overlong at 3 hours, 1 minute.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B-",

  "content": "I should probably have watched the first one of these from last year to remind me because a bit like when “Maya” (Madeleine Petsch) wakes up in hospital, I couldn’t remember what she’d survived either. We are quickly reminded that her and her perfectly manscaped boyfriend “Jeff” (who must have read the script so stayed home and trimmed his beard this time) had been gruesomely assaulted by three local spooks bedecked in rudimentary face masks. He’s since gone the way of the dodo, but she managed to make it to the hospital where the cops were aghast at her story. Thing is, though, once her murderous antagonists discover that not only did she she survive, but that she’s in the local hospital, then the scene is set for a chapter two. Preposterousness now ensues in an almost risible fashion, as she is pursued through this almost empty hospital and then out into the woods towards the very cabin in which their misery began. Of course, after last time, she has mastered some rustic ninja skills but unsure who she can trust from this tightly-knit community, what are her chances of survival against the trio of tormentors who want to slice and dice her - just because she is there? The dialogue is barely worth mentioning, the acting plaudits are easily stolen by the masks - at least they a supposed to be plastic, and the frying pan to fire scenarios that unfold make the decision to board the Titanic in 1912 seem entirely risk-free by comparison. The only thing that is truly scary is that this tees up for a sequel, otherwise it’s a shocker in all the wrong ways.",

  "content": "Seemingly abandoned by his dad in an alleyway in the rain, poor little \"Garfield\" espies the unsuspecting and lonely looking \"Jon\" having a pizza across the road. In a shot he's looking all sad and bedraggled at the windows, next he's demolished the man's dinner and finally coaxed him from his comfortable flat to a new house that they share with the dog \"Odie\". His life is just one idyllic round of snoozing, eating and watching \"Catflix\" until he and \"Odie\" are kidnapped. Why? Well it's only when they are rescued by a caped hero - who turns out to be his dad \"Vic\", and we then are introduced to the criminal mastermind that is \"Jinx\" who has an axe to grind, that we start to get to the bottom things. She spent ages in the pound and is looking for her pint of milk! Now \"Garfield\", \"Odie\" and \"Vic\" have to come up with plan to rob a well defended dairy to settle scores. Even if they succeed, can they trust the duplicitous \"Jinx\" and her two sinister hench-creatures? It's an amiable enough adventure movie, this, with plenty of daft escapades for the cats, a menacing security officer and even an old lovelorn bull (\"Otto\") who's seen better days. I found the story reminded me a bit of the \"Wallace and Gromit\" kind of mishap-ridden narrative and though it's probably twenty minutes too long to sustain a film that doesn't seem to ever want to end, it's got the usual messages to team-playing, family and loyalty and has some quite witty one-liners now and again.",

The villain doesn't have a great performance either but that's mostly due to poor writing, they could've done something far greater than her. But the creativity that's present is short lived if it's constantly followed by a villain saying a poor landing joke, or even a main character.\r\n\r\nHow can a Garfield movie truly be done? After seeing this I have little hope for Garfield movies in the future. But the idea of Garfield being in a movie is outlandish and quite hard to make a feasible plot without introducing lame characters. This franchise is hard to make acceptable for fans since it will never live up to what Garfield truly is. But to give us an hour and a half of our time with him for a outlandish, out of this world, story is enough regardless of how bad it might be, because it will never work out.",

Initially, I didn’t expect much, but by the end, I found myself loving this fun and adventurous film. It has a lot of heart, some good laughs, and is great for parents to take their kids to.\r\n\r\nOne of the standout elements of the movie is the introduction of Garfield’s father, Vic. This addition brings a fresh perspective to the Garfield universe. The dysfunctional father-son dynamic adds depth to the story, making it more engaging. \r\n\r\nThe plot cleverly intertwines this family dynamic with a heist storyline, which adds excitement and keeps the narrative moving at a brisk pace. The movie offers plenty of laughs, with jokes that appeal to both kids and adults. The humor is well-timed and varies from slapstick to witty one-liners, ensuring that there is something for everyone.\r\n\r\nOdie, in particular, stands out and truly rocks in this film. His loyal and energetic presence brings a lot of charm to the screen. The chemistry between Garfield and Odie is spot on, providing some of the film’s most memorable moments. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, The Garfield Movie is a delightful surprise and a significant step up from its predecessors. With its heartwarming story, engaging characters, and balanced humor, it’s a film that both kids and parents can enjoy together. The addition of Garfield’s father, Vic, and the dynamic he brings to the story, along with Odie’s standout moments, make this a must-watch for fans of the beloved cat.

  "content": "“The Batman” Is A Very Engaging And Unforgettable Tale That Is One Of The Best Adaptations Of The Character Ever\r\n\r\nIn 1989 Michael Keaton was seen as a very controversial choice to wear the Cowl of Batman but soon proved his doubters wrong by turning “Batman” and its subsequent sequel “Batman Returns” into massive Box Office success before leaving the cape behind.\r\n\r\nWhile four other actors have taken up the cinematic version of the character in the subsequent years, Keaton has remained for many the Gold Standard with Christian Bale likely being his biggest rival.\r\n\r\nWhen Robert Pattinson was named as the new Batman, there was interest but concern as an actor who is largely known for playing Edward in the “Twilight” films seemed to be an odd choice. However, I would say that anyone who has seen some of his recent work including his performance in “The Lighthouse” would be playing him a disservice by saying he was not up to the part.\r\n\r\nIn “The Batman”, audiences are given a darker and more broken Bruce Wayne, an Emo recluse who is far from the Socialite he has been portrayed as for decades and a very sullen and withdrawn individual who does not exude charm or grace and even shows issues making eye-contact.\r\n\r\nWhen the Mayor of Gotham is killed shortly before the election by a mysterious individual known as “The Riddler” (Paul Dano), the vigilante known as “The Batman” is called in to help the police by Lt. James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright).  Gordon has been working with Batman for some time but it is clear that his association with him has not won him any favors with his fellow officers, many of which openly question his use and involvement in the crime scenes.\r\n\r\nFurther complicating matters are clues left at the various crime locales that are addressed to The Batman and cause many to believe that he may be working with the very killer they are attempting to stop.\r\n\r\nAs the investigation unfolds, the seedy side of Gotham City comes to light in the form of a missing girl who was photographed with the married Mayor and may well be the key to the investigation. Her disappearance leads her friend Selina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz), to take on her Catwoman persona and delve deep into an underworld that features deadly individuals ranging from Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), and The Penguin (Colin Farrell), amongst others as she and the Batman conduct their own investigations that at times overlap and further complicate matters.\r\n\r\nAs the body count rises and Batman races to find the true method behind the madness of The Riddler, the tone becomes darker and more sinister in a deadly race against time.\r\n\r\nThe film eschews the usual abundance of action sequences and glossy special effects which are common for Comic Book related films and instead gives audiences a slow-burning murder mystery that holds your attention from start to finish over its three-hour run time.\r\n\r\nThe dark and foreboding tone of the film is brought home by the haunting and sharp piano keys of the film’s theme that permeates the film and punches home that this is a film clearly aimed at a more adult audience.\r\n\r\nPattinson does a great job showing the deeply broken individual that is behind the mask and that Batman is the only form of escape or therapy that Bruce Wayne has due to his insistence on saving a city that many argue cannot be saved. He has strained his relationship at times with Alfred (Andy Serkis), caused damage to the financial stability and reputation of the family company in his quest for vengeance and justice, and has become a bitter and broken recluse in doing so. In many ways, it could be argued that his only socialization with others is as The Batman and his single-minded obsession is chilling to watch.\r\n\r\nPattinson also handles the action sequences well as the film spaces them out to put the emphasis more on the man than the gadgets as they are kept to a minimum even during a thrilling chase with the new version of The Batmobile.\r\n\r\nThe strong supporting cast works well with the film and Paul Dano gives a very compelling and disturbing version of his character which makes the film even darker and more engrossing.\r\n\r\nDirector Matt Reeves has crafted a dark and foreboding tone and visual style as a good portion of the film takes place in the darkness and his screenplay is not afraid to take chances by putting the emphasis on the characters and their flaws versus an abundance of action and effects.\r\n\r\nI found this version of the character and interpretation more engrossing than prior versions of the film as the bold move to do a slow-burning and dark murder mystery versus an effect-laden action film reminded me of some of the better Batman stories such as Batman: The Killing Joke or Batman: The Long Halloween.\r\n\r\nThe film is not going to be for everyone, especially younger viewers and some may take issue with the casting choices, but their performances shine and as such, “The Batman” was a very engaging and unforgettable tale that for me serves as one of the best adaptations of the character ever.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5",

I was expecting to be blown away and was not but even with that being said The Batman is an exceptional film.  The cinematography and visuals are stunning.  Matt Reeves made some genius creative choices among which were the more reclusive rockstar grungy Bruce Wayne and the Riddler being heavily influenced by the Zodiac.  The acting was fantastic as well with Zoe Kravitz and Paul Dano offering some standout performances.  The Batman is driven with psychological and mystery focus as compared to the action comedy style of most superhero movies.  My only complaint is that the mystery felt fairly predictable.  I wasn't surprised by any of the twists and turns.  Ultimately, this was a wonderful addition to the Batman franchise and I can't wait to see where it goes next.",

The entire cast is extraordinary, especially Paul Dano and Robert Pattinson - the latter destroys all skepticism around his talent.\r\n\r\nApart from a short period at the end of the second act, the three hours fly by.

The film deserves credit for prominently shining the spotlight on the underbelly of crime in Gotham, but the storytelling in _The Batman_ is a lot like Bugs Bunny meaning to have taken that left turn at Albuquerque; a meandering foray down a dark rabbit hole that isn’t entirely necessary.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/The-Batman-2022-Review-When-is-a-Bat-Not-Quite-a-Bat",

  "content": "_**\"Our scars can destroy us, even after the physical wounds have healed. But if we survive them, they can transform us. They can give us the power to endure, and the strength to fight.\"**_\r\n\r\nEver since it was announced that Matt Reeves was going to direct The Batman after Ben Affleck stepped down for personal reasons, I had no doubt he was going to put on one hell of a masterpiece. This is the definitive live-action Batman. An epic 3-hour film noir that delves deep into comic lore of Gotham City.\r\n\r\nRobert Pattinson perfectly embodies both Bruce Wayne and Batman. I love the character arc he goes through, realizing Gotham doesn't need vengeance to heal, but hope. Zoë Kravitz plays a phenomenal Selina Kyle, you actually feel her emotions throughout the movie. Another plus is that she actually feels integral to the plot (unlike The Dark Knight Rises). Paul Dano is a terrifyingly realistic interpretation of The Riddler, using the internet to gain a fan base for his sick games. Andy Serkis plays an excellent Alfred, being Bruce's emotional support during Dark times.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack by Michael Giacchino is absolute God-Tier. Elevating every scene with emotion and sometimes dread. Finally a score to rival Danny Elfman's iconic score. Matt Reeves direction is impeccable as always, getting some nice shots while also making it feel nice and claustrophobic around Batman.\r\n\r\nOverall, a God-Tier Batman movie that I can't wait for the Cinematic Universe that's being made around it as I type this.",

  "content": "It's a cracker, no doubt about it!\r\n\r\nMatt Reeves did a great job with 2022's <em>'The Batman'</em>. It's difficult not to compare this to other Batman films, though that's DC/Warner Bros. fault for featuring him so much in recent times. I'll get this out the way early: I'd say <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/batman-begins/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batman Begins</a>'</em>/'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-dark-knight/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Dark Knight</a>'</em> are superior, not by much, which is a similar case for the character performances too.\r\n\r\nRobert Pattinson is a terrific Bruce Wayne, though Christian Bale still edges him out in my eyes. Zoë Kravitz is probably the best Catwoman I've seen, though the rest - from the Riddler to Penguin to Alfred - have been portrayed better; aside from Commissioner Gordon, with Jeffrey Wright being excellent. Paul Dano is the least enjoyable performer, for me, here, I found his showing to be a bit 'meh' - effective, but meh. Barry Keoghan makes a cameo, I won't say as who, but I don't hold high hopes for him in that role; though, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/film/news/the-batman-ending-joker-barry-keoghan-matt-reeves-1235196812/#:~:text=While%20it%20may,more%20%E2%80%9CBatman%E2%80%9D%20movies.\" rel=\"nofollow\">apparently</a> it won't be anything that happens anyway. For the best!\r\n\r\nAnyway... the above sounds <em>way</em> too negative - as I did thoroughly and absolutely enjoy this film, hence the very positive rating. The pacing is very good, the cinematography is brilliant (Gotham looks fantastically bleak!), the story is engrossing and the dialogue is on point. The scenes with Pattinson/Kravitz and Pattinson/Wright are my favourite moments. It's a film that I'd consider as 'outstanding'.\r\n\r\nIt'll be cool to see what Reeves does with this trilogy (should it happen, of course).",

  "content": "I like how Batman is depicted with a naive and loser POV from his rich high tower, a rich trust fund baby called out by both sane (Catwoman) and insane (Riddler) people while he remains oblivious until the consequences are literally flooding the city. While he uses the idea of Batman as a mantle for him to process trauma, his obliviousness to his own celebrity status and image creates unintentional side effects from his parents' death hogging the spotlight away from the people that mattered to his own nebulous idea of \"vengeance\" being co-opted by the goons, a heel-turn realization that eventually changes the rack focus, ultimately leading to a wider perspective and a selfless act of cutting the cord and helping others. Hope is more important than his idea of justice, in the end, empathy being the missing piece throughout. Instead of being a voyeur like Riddler during his master plan (Riddler binoculars on the mayor, Batman binoculars on Catwoman), he switches to being on the ground to help, no longer from his high castle.\r\n\r\nIt's interesting how this arc plays out. At the beginning, it plays into this \"badass\" idea comic book fans love to gloat about Batman of striking fear into crime, but the way it's portrayed is frightening to everyone. It's a better criticism of Batman's fascism than BvS was going for, showcasing his fear to people who don't even deserve it, such as kids doing vandalism who probably believe the system is failing them, but to him at the beginning crime all looks the same.\r\n\r\nHonestly this film goes harder than Phantasm on the tragedy that is Bruce Wayne. They're inseparable by choice, to the point that Bruce basically is Batman even when not in the costume, a social recluse who can barely function in real life, listening to emo music and having rings around his eyes, a night owl to the extreme. The struggle is there even as Batman, literally smashing his face on a truck.\r\n\r\nThere are some contradictions throughout thematically, however. It's weird how it goes between \"it's the WHOLE system, all cops are pigs\" to \"it's just bad apples\" simultaneously, displaying a somewhat cringe centrism. Catwoman by the end basically points it more to systemic (and Batman and Thomas Wayne's criticism of thinking they know better and actually makings things worse isn't undercut, which by itself is also institutional criticism), although it still feels like they could've done more. Maybe out of their hands by the studio or this as far as they could get away with vs. the producers (it almost felt like a struggle for Catwoman to outline her \"eat the rich\" mentality). Gotham itself is a mess of contradictions and it's OK to let the viewer lie between it all I guess.\r\n\r\nAlso the relationship between Catwoman and Batman is kinda slimy and male-centric. Catwoman, while great as a character, functionally falls to Batman's controlling force with a forced romance in the second act. Sure they're both suffering from trauma but Batman was literally using her despite it all, it at least understands the power gap more in the third act.\r\n\r\nThe end of the second act also spins its wheels a bit too much, the mystery pace kinda suffers a bit from focus and scenes get too drawn out (Riddler just disappears for a while). The movie could've been 20 minutes shorter. Doesn't stop it from having a terrific third act since most blockbusters have kinda sucked on that note\r\nAlthough speaking of Riddler, master class. Probably my favorite villain in a Batman film. \r\n\r\nThe aesthetic was gorgeous. I love its color grading and architecture, still thinking of the Wayne tower and its metal grates, goth hallways, and insane attention to detail that gets blurred out intentionally in the frame for most of the movie by Bruce's obliviousness to the world. It also keeps a balance of evoking the black/white movies while still being colorful, more of flooded black and oranges. I think of that sequence with Penguin not mainly for the fight itself (which to me was a bit messy) but moreso the flooded orange of the fire being the only color creating a sorta gradient on the black car, and how the flare at the end matches that aesthetic, that one color illuminating Batman leading everybody else to exit the frame, like a light in the darkness. Lovely\r\n\r\nThe music.... Giacchino just beat out his Incredibles score for me, masterful work with motifs, percussion, and rhythm. His mastery of percussion and horns during the lights out Batman hallway fight and how the horns blast, how well edited the percussion beat subtly goes through the Penguin chase and other fight sequences, Batman doesn't quite have a dance like Hong Kong films but the music makes it come close. The timpani and strings are so well used!!! Great use of Ave Maria both as soundtrack and score. Catwoman's motif? Amazing.\r\n\r\nThe performances are great all around. Finally a film with Turturro that I don't hate him. He's well restrained and perfectly cast, his dickish attitude now a strong point making him very memorable with very little screen time, much like Farrell in the same film. Kravitz made me the closest to tearing up with how she visually handles conflicting emotions, I still think about that scene with the voicemail where her eyes are all over the place and has trouble keeping it all together. Dano as Riddler is terrific.\r\n\r\nYep, this is my fav Batman film now.",

  "content": "This film is so intricate, there's so many details, things you can obverse on multiple watches and not have noticed on your first. There's a lot of things that just aren't spoken that give this film so much substance. So many layers and nuanced story telling. Gotham City feels as it should, as it's own character and a visceral cesspool of corruption and just dirt. It feels dirty, unpolished... it's amazing.\r\n\r\nThere's so many shots in this film that are just simply breathtaking and intentionally dirty. It helps capture this visceral tone and fits substantially well with the universe of Batman.\r\n\r\nBeing a diehard fan of Batman for, like, pretty much all of my life- I have to say; Matt Reeves absolutely nailed it with a completely faithful adaptation of Batman. Not once in this movie did he do something I felt was completely out of character and Robert Pattinson solidified the performance of both Bruce Wayne and the Batman. I love Matt Reeves went to the extent to make sure this Batman doesn't kill, as other directors have seem to give less care to. Yes, even Nolan. It should have to go without saying that Batman does not kill, that's a no-brainer, but for decades this has been a problem in Batman films... and finally, it no longer is a problem. That's how you do it.\r\n\r\nBringing this review to a conclusion, this is easily my favourite Batman film. So many things about this film just feel like it's pulled straight out of a comic book. I mean, Riddler flooding the city itself is pulled straight from Zero Year and there's so many nods to comic moments and members of Batman's rouges gallery. Matt Reeves knew what he was doing, and he crafted this film for diehard Batman fans, succeeding immensely. Can't wait to see more of this universe.",

  "content": "> Enormous mass that is per se a riddle. Forget screenplay, it's a comic storyboard; Do you remember Rorschach, from Moore's Watchmen, ruminating in the sewers?, ok, transpolate Batman and it works! No way, here I go-monologue and comic dialogues (effective and practical like instant soup, with 2 percent protein), comic narration, that is functional, utilitarian, Bentham would say, with the ellipses and any speech or reasoning that requires 2 minutes of reflection, at most!, \"\"this whole city´s gonna come apart\" says a District Attorney, scenic cuts and messy complexity...-entertaining but messy-comic, etc, ...it is a comic turned into a movie by someone who - I'm speculating, any resemblance to reality is purely by chance - was advised or made, or made comics in his life, don't you believe me? Ellipsis of all ellipses: \"Alfred, you're not my father \"At 23 minutes of tape, all the conflict of identity and belonging, as well as the purpose of the hero, under the sieve of the most selfish and mean son of millionaires, but let's forget this, let's continue. A Batman beating Kurt's velvety drum Cobain, -didn't tell the subversive c revolutionary adence of Cobain, to think like that I would have to know that grunge swept hardrock -finally in the 90s- and buried Motley Crue, Guns and Roses and others, (yes, I mentioned him, Cobain, and not Nirvana that did not exist, that's why when we die we are left without this specific type of grunge, I already digressed, anyway) but yes, this Batman is doubly omniscient, an ego the size of Gotham City authorizes him (a) not only to -his first omniscience- speaking in the first person of himself when running the plot, that is to say in the events, \"I am revenge\" he says to the subway gang members, (scene that is not better than Todd Phillips' Koker subway, for give another example) that this happened -the first person- almost in all the other versions that precede it,it is also included here -its omniscience, obviously- dominating forensic or medical terms: \"eschimia\"? ask Batman of course!, but to (b), his second omniscience, being the narrator of his exploits in the first person, this again leads us to an Alan Moore influence but, with all due respect, as a clericot of Alan's genius Moore. When Batman wants to see the Penguin, he just has to be like the Penguin, appear in the doorway and announce himself, and please, for the fun of the plot, Batman almost spouts a sentence \"please tell me you won't let me in to unfold my money in the form of weapons hidden in my suit, and get in anyway. That is to say, the theatricality and the shadows of the bat, remained in the Babyboomer Generation or Generation X when the entrance was an \"appearance\" through shadows, suspicion and myth. The film is a complex mass because it is as if The Batman, The Batman 2 and 3 had been compressed and I am not only talking about the exhausting time of almost 3 hours, but also because of the number of common threads in which it was woven into a single feature film. For example, the plot increases its complexity first with a Riddler who is an anti-hero, because he indirectly helps Batman and the supposed common good and because of the premises that justify his murders, unmasking the big shots of the underworld at high levels of government, but later, arrested as Edward Nashton, he unmasks himself, that is, he turns himself in, sitting in that cafeteria just when, then yes, we will understand his \"fine\" intentions, and he becomes a true public order villain because he incites the revenge to the uncritical masses and followers of the disorder who have suffered or have resentments for any type of discrimination or corruption that they have suffered in Gotham city, (no more and no less than similar to the end of Todd Phillips' Joker);another complexity is with the cat The cat, I will not say Catwoman, who has her own drama for Kyle and at some point Batman leans on her, to spy on the Prosecutor and at least 2 times saves her from murdering her father Carmine Falcone and the his father's henchman. On the other hand, there is the added density or complexity of transcending and publishing the videos that show that the mother of Bruce Wayne, the mother of Batman had psychiatric problems in Arkham and hospitals and comes from a family that descendants who also had these difficulties and Thomas Wayne , trying to silence the journalist, he used the biggest thug Falcone. In other words, there is a possibility that Falcone, Catwoman's stepfather, is the one who murdered the Waynes that night because Batman's father was about to pity or denounce the next day that he only wanted to silence the journalist and NOT murder him as Falcone did. . In short, it is entertaining but poorly planned for a single feature film due to the enormous amount of detail that is handled.",

However, it didn't realise that 'Saving Private Ryan' took a lot of ideas from old war movies and paid homage to them whilst delivering awe-inspiring and moving scenes of battles.\r\n\r\n'Fury' did not have this. A lot of the dialogue and interaction between characters was laughable. The romance that tried to be thrown in at the middle of the film did not work and just seemed bizarre, The characters were one-dimensional and just seemed like walking stereotypes. The film felt more like 'Tropic Thunder' than 'Saving Private Ryan'. \r\n\r\n'Fury''s lack of long shots of the landscapes and battles meant that the film did not seem as vast or beautiful as other films of the genre.\r\n\r\nHowever, the action scenes were very well done and it was exciting and superbly directed.\r\n\r\n★★★½",

  "content": "I knew that quite a few people had complained about the realism in this movie even though it hold high ratings on most movie sites. I was hoping that the complaints were mostly nitpicking like wrong model of Sherman tank and such like. Well, I am afraid that it was a bit more than that. I would say that this movie is clearly written by some Hollywood writer sitting in his comfy chair and never ever having been close to any military activities, not to mention live action, in his life.\n\nI can live with a movie being inaccurate or somewhat unrealistic if the rest of the movie is good but I have to say that I did not really like the movie even after trying to filter out the unrealistic nonsense.\n\nThe movie is very dark and gritty and there are really no likeable characters in it whatsoever. Well, the clerk that got thrown in as a tank machinegun gunner was perhaps somewhat likable but then him getting assigned as a tank machinegun gunner in the first place was one of those nonsensical bits. In this movie the “heroes” are not really any better than the Nazis. The scene where “Wardaddy” forces previously mentioned clerk to shoot an unarmed POW is just disgusting. I am sure this is not too far from reality in some cases during the war but I’ll be damned if I am watching a movie to be entertained by it.\n\nHaving said that I must also say that the movie was very well done in terms of acting and cinematography with one exception. The ridiculous overuse of tracer bullet effects. Tracer bullets do not look like you are in a Star Wars movie and yes I have been using tracer bullets during my military service, obviously unlike the producer and consultants (if they had any) of this movie.\n\nThe pacing of the movie was somewhat uneven. Some of it was fairly fast paced but then some parts, like the part in the apartment of the two German women was quite slow and somewhat dull.\n\nThe “last stand” at the end was just silly and nonsensical. It started pretty much right away when the poor clerk spots the arriving German infantry just using his eyes. Then it just takes forever until they actually arrive so our “heroes” have all the time in the world to prepare. There would of course be no way for a lone Sherman to hold off an assault like that and the Germans would of course not be charging around shooting useless fine caliber weaponry against said Sherman. Also when they had all this time to prepare why the f… did they leave some of the ammo outside the tank? Obviously because some dumb scriptwriter thought it would make for a good scene. And do not get me started on the fact that the Germans apparently just stops in their tracks every time the director thinks it is time for some slow scene inside the tank.\n\nThe ending? Well I do not like bad endings and this one certainly did not give me any feeling of reward for having suffered through over two hours of this movie. Needless to say I am a tad disappointed.",

  "content": "WWII through the eyes of a Sherman tank crew\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2014, \"Fury\" details the exploits of 'Wardaddy' (Brad Pitt) and his Sherman tank crew during the final month of the European theater of World War II. A meek new guy who knows little about tanks, Norman (Logan Lerman), joins the crew and must learn to kill. Making a final push into the heart of Nazi Germany, the Fury crew makes a heroic stand when their tank breaks down. \r\n\r\nWriter/director Dick Ayers wrote the screenplay for 2001's excellent \"Training Day.\" In \"Fury\" he successfully shows the soldiers’ view of WWII through the eyes of a Sherman tank crew. I know of no other war film that sets out or accomplishes this; Oddball and his crew from \"Kelly's Heroes\" (1970) perhaps comes closest.\r\n\r\nI mainly judge films by whether or not the story keeps my attention. After all, what good is great action, thrills and incredible special effects if the story (or the way it's told) is dullsville, like, say, \"The Mummy Returns\" (2001) or \"Man of Steel\"(2013)? \"Fury\" kept my attention from beginning to end and the characters are all memorable. Speaking of which, the three remaining crewmembers are 'Bible' (Shia LaBeouf), 'Coonass' (Jon Bernthal) and 'Gordo' (Michael Peña). \r\n\r\n'Bible' is fittingly an evangelical who strives not to lose his spirituality while brutally annihilating people in the name of war, whereas newcomer Norman is a mainline Christian (Episcopalian). A handful of scripture passages are quoted during the course of the movie, including a couple near the end by Wardaddy. This is an interesting revelation because Wardaddy has become hardened by the war after three years fighting from North Africa all the way to the nucleus of the Nazis. This implies that he was a devoted believer before the war but only a glimmer of his former spiritual affection remains. There are other quality character bits interspersed throughout the film, like how annoying drunk bastages may not be so bad once they sober up.\r\n\r\nBeyond the above, the film offers the typical tragic insights about the nature of war. The long final stand in the last act may be unlikely, but it makes for a heroic and thrilling ending to a war movie (yes, it's a MOVIE, not a friggin' documentary). At the end of the day \"Fury\" arguably ranks with the best WWII movies, like \"Where Eagles Dare\" (1968), \"Enemy at the Gates\" (2001), \"The Eagle has Landed\" (1976), \"Bridge on the River Kwai\" (1957), \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967), \"The Thin Red Line\" (1998), and \"Inglourious Basterds\" (2009). As far as comparing it to the overrated \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998), the first half hour of that movie is great, but the rest of it leaves much to be desired (remember the lame dog tag sequence?); \"Fury\" is leagues better IMHO. \r\n\r\nThe melancholic and moving score by Steven Price is a highlight. Alicia von Rittberg (Emma), Anamaria Marinca (Irma) and Jason Isaacs are featured in fairly notable roles. Speaking of Emma, the brief romance between her and Norman is decidedly forced, which is one of the few negatives of \"Fury,\" but I get the point of that sequence.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 134 minutes and was shot in England. \r\n\r\nGRADE: A-",

Yet even he has some humanity left in him, but he hardly shows it.\r\nThe other three are the tank commander (Brad Pitt), who handles brutality of war with objectivity, his second, who handles brutality by trying to be right with God, and the other one uses comedy to handle it.\r\nI've been in the military, and it is quite common for \"clerks\" to be tossed into war like cannon fodder, because that is what \"clerks\" are viewed as being by everyone else, from officers down to the one stripers.\r\nIn fact, the clerks are considered to be the most disposable members of the forces. \r\nWe know that today. People didn't always know it in WW2.\r\nThe final self sacrifice at the end seems a bit much, but when you take into consideration that it's a spare of the moment decision, and mistakes are made with quick decisions, it's plausible. Not probable, but plausible.\r\nAlso, the final battle scene with five men doing so well against an incredibly larger force; well, that is sold to us by the amount of smoke around the tank, and the fact that if you are on the other side, surrounding the tank, you wonder if you are shooting at your own teammates across from you. \r\nI think it would have been a better movie if the five soldiers all just abandoned the tank and tried to walk back to safety, but that's just me.\r\nOther than that, it was an exceptional film that passes all the tests.",

The cast was amazing, with Jon Bernthal's performance standing out the most to me. Brad Pitt, Logan Lerman, & Shia LeBouf also were great in this movie, as this was arguably one of the greatest collective casts of that year. I initially was a little let down by the cinematography, but as the movie progressed it definitely recovered. Characterization is another thing that stands out significantly in this movie. Grady (Jon Bernthal) is probably the best example of this, though the depth given to Boyd (Shia LeBouf) & Trini (Michael Pena) through their characterization was amazing as well. The final aspect of the film that I loved was the dialogue. Though it wasn't Game of Thrones, the ability to bring depth, characterization, symbolism, and so many others things to the story through dialogue was very well done.\r\n\r\nThis is one of David Ayers greatest pieces of work and I highly suggest this movie!!!",

  "content": "We’re all familiar with the old adage that, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. It’s a notion that applies not only to what can happen in everyday life, but also to what shows up on the big screen, as the latest feature from writer-director Sean Baker illustrates. This widely acclaimed indie offering follows the misadventures of a Brooklyn lap dancer/sex worker (Mikey Madison) who falls for the insanely rich, self-absorbed, wildly irresponsible son of a Russian oligarch (Mark Eydelshteyn). Together they take the plunge into an edgy, wacked-out fairy tale, a dark storybook romance strung out on steroids, quaaludes and crack. Their whirlwind affair soon lands them in Las Vegas, culminating in a green card wedding that junior’s mobster parents (Darya Ekamasova, Aleksey Serebryakov) want annulled at any cost, even if it means calling on their oily, bumbling posse of cronies and heavies (Karren Karagulian, Vache Tovmasyan, Yura Borisov) to lean on the alleged lovebirds. But achieving that goal ultimately proves more difficult than imagined. As a cross-country chase ensues, a string of frenzied events leaves mom, dad and friends infuriated and the Gothamite Cinderella disillusioned, having erroneously thought she’d truly hit the jackpot this time. From this, one might easily think this premise has a solid foundation for an outrageous, uproarious comedy, but, sadly, the film lives up to its potential only some of the time. To be sure, there is some genuinely hysterical, wonderfully inventive material here, but it only hits the mark about half the time. What’s more, much of the story (especially in the film’s first half) is predictable, almost clichéd, with some bits dragging on needlessly long. Indeed, I’m somewhat mystified as to what all the critical fuss is about, something perhaps best evidenced by the picture’s capture of the Palme d’Or at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, the event’s highest honor. I readily admit to being a fan of Baker’s work, having immensely enjoyed his previous efforts “Red Rocket” (2021), “The Florida Project” (2017) and “Tangerine” (2015). But I’m genuinely at a loss to understand the level of praise that’s been lavished on this release. It’s a capable film in a number of respects, but the filmmaker clearly has done better, and those prior offerings make better viewing options in my opinion. Don’t fall for all the hype here, as this really is one of those cases of something being too good to be true.",

That's when she encounters the young \"Vanya\" (Mark Eydelshteyn). He's pretty drunk, completely stoned and has more money than God. He wants a dance, he wants much more - but that's not allowed in the club, so he invites her to his luxury pad next day for fun. She actually quite likes his youthful exuberance - and his cash - and after a few days, a Russian sable coat, and a trip to Vegas, they find themselves marred. Social media now takes an hand and his oligarch mother hears news that her son has married an hooker. Livid, she instructs her local fixer \"Toros\" (Karren Karagulian) to sort the mess out.

This film starts off strongly with an entertaining courtship scenario played out between two actors who really do look like they are enjoying themselves. Eydelshteyn delivers enthusiastically and acrobatically, there's loads of sex and quite witty dialogue that plays nicely on the language barriers. Once the second phase of the film starts, though, it runs out of steam a little. \"Vanya\" doesn't feature so much and the story becomes a little less engaging as the rather too gentle thugs and the increasingly irate girl try to get everyone to the courthouse for the ruling before his angry mother arrives. That leaves us with too much overacting from Karagulian and some increasingly implausible scenarios as the air is gradually let out of the thing and it comes to end rather disappointingly. At it's best, though, the first hour is quickly paced and takes an amiable swipe at the sex trade and the players who make and take from it. Certainly worth a watch, it just hasn't quite the courage of it's initial convictions.",

  "content": "Anora is a film that starts off strong, pulling you in with an intriguing setup and a well-paced first act. It follows a story that keeps you invested, blending drama with some unexpected humor. The second act stretches a bit longer than needed, but it's clear that was intentional to build atmosphere and let certain themes play out. While the pacing is deliberate, it sometimes feels like it's lingering in places that don't add much depth to the characters. That being said, the buildup is engaging, even if the payoff leaves something to be desired.\r\n\r\nSean Baker's directing is solid, capturing a raw, almost documentary-like feel that makes the film feel real and immersive. He knows how to make everyday settings feel alive and uses long takes effectively. The cinematography complements this, keeping things grounded with natural lighting and handheld shots that add an almost voyeuristic feel to the story. It’s visually well-crafted, even if it doesn’t aim for anything particularly stylized. The way the camera lingers on certain moments adds weight to the film's themes, even when the script doesn’t fully explore them.\r\n\r\nMikey Madison delivers a standout performance, carrying much of the film. She brings a layered energy to the role, making her character feel both confident and vulnerable when needed. The supporting cast does their job well, but the script doesn't give them much depth to work with. That’s one of the film’s weaknesses, while it sets up an interesting premise and characters, it doesn’t fully flesh them out. You get a sense of their motivations, but not much beyond that. The dialogue is sharp in some moments but feels underdeveloped in others, leaving certain interactions feeling a bit hollow.\r\n\r\nThe score and sound design are subtle, used more for atmosphere than standout moments. The film relies heavily on natural sounds and ambient noise, which works well for its grounded approach. It enhances the realism but doesn't do much to elevate the emotions of the film. \r\n\r\nOverall, Anora is a well-directed and well-acted film that keeps you engaged, but it doesn’t quite stick the landing. If you’re looking for a character-driven story with a raw, unfiltered feel, it’s worth a watch, but don’t expect a big payoff in the end.",

As usual, I'm not one to judge it on its deep-rooted meaning or whatever, I'll leave that to others, all I can say is that it's a blast and I unequivocally loved it.\r\n\r\nMikey Madison's performance is sensational, quite the showing indeed! Apparently I've seen her in three other things (much less prominent roles, admittedly) before, evidently I don't remember her from those - but safe to say, I won't be forgetting Madison from this at any point. Superb!\r\n\r\nAway from the star performer, Mark Eydelshteyn makes the most out of his role. The trio of Karren Karagulian, Vache Tovmasyan and Yura Borisov are great comedic support. I've seen Aleksei Serebryakov here and there down the years and he always plays the same roles, I like him though.\r\n\r\nThe 139 minutes go by in a flash, with the utterly chaotic nature it is no surprise. It isn't the most difficult movie to predict given that you are waiting for the crap to hit the fan, but how it gets to that point is a wild ride to witness - the concluding scene is stand out, too.\r\n\r\nI still have three more of the nominees to watch, but this overtakes <em>'The Substance'</em> as the film that would hypothetically get my vote for Best Picture; not that I take much value from that (or any other) awards ceremony.

  "content": "Despite a very rough start, “Anora” ultimately offers a unique and entertaining exploration of the humanity behind sex work and the complexities of love, pain, and trauma. I was so close to giving up on the film during its excruciating opening thirty minutes, which I found dull, grating, and gratuitous. The early part of the movie is laden with an unnecessary and gratuitous parade of explicit scenes and a focus on unlikable characters doing uninteresting things. Now I am thankful that I didn’t storm out of the theater, because the eventual payoff is more than worth the investment.\r\n\r\nAs I reflect on the film, I’ve come to the realization that the style and tone of the film’s opening half hour might be more intentional than I first thought. Writer and director Sean Baker, known for his ability to capture the lives of marginalized people with empathy and complexity in his previous works “The Florida Project” and “Tangerine,” appears to be making a deliberate statement. The first act, with its emphasis on the superficial, transactional view of sex work, feels almost intentionally alienating, highlighting how society often reduces sex workers to mere objects of desire that exist solely to be used, abused, and discarded. It’s designed to make viewers uncomfortable, mostly because it seems to be a critique of how these people are seen as less than human. Sex workers like Anora are often dismissed as disposable rather than as individuals with depth and feelings.\r\n\r\nOnce the film transitions into the second act, it gains momentum and its true heartbeat emerges. The focus shifts to Anora (Mikey Madison), a young sex worker from Brooklyn who impulsively marries a powerful Russian oligarch’s playboy son, Ivan (Mark Eydelshteyn). As news of the marriage reaches Russia, it threatens to derail her new life. Ivan’s parents are infuriated and head to New York to have the union annulled. The plot sounds like a simple and goofy romantic comedy, but it becomes more layered as the film progresses.\r\n\r\nBaker excels in depicting characters on the fringes of society, and Anora is no exception. She’s flawed, complicated, and completely human in her desire to be happy, safe, and loved. As we get to know the character better, her strength, resilience, and vulnerability shines through. It’s a real testament to how much Baker understands his characters and the environments they inhabit. They are never caricatures but relatable, normal people caught up in difficult, often tragic circumstances. And this, I think, is where the film really succeeds.\r\n\r\nIt’s a serious story that takes an unexpected turn when a trio of bumbling criminal characters show up, adding some much-needed levity and energy to the film. The comedic angle is strange but also highly entertaining, which provides a nice contrast to the tension-filled dramatic elements. The humor balances the more serious undertones of the story and injects an unexpected freshness into the film, making it easier (and a lot more fun) to invest in Anora’s journey.\r\n\r\nWhat’s really going to have audiences talking is the ending, and it’s the place where the film leaves its most notable mark. I can imagine the final frame will be analyzed and discussed and misunderstood, but it’s one of the most profound, heartbreaking, and touching conclusions I’ve seen this year.\r\n\r\nWARNING: I am issuing a spoiler alert for the next paragraph. Please stop reading now if you’ve not yet seen the film.\r\n\r\nWhen Igor (Yura Borisov) and Anora are together in the final act, this isn’t a typical “rescue” or “knight in shining armor” trope that you’d expect to find in a romantic film. Their sad and painful attempt at intimacy is a deeply meaningful and emotional recognition between two people who have been hurt by the world in similar ways. It’s a poignant reminder that love and healing often come from shared experiences of pain, and that empathy can transcend even the most complicated circumstances. It’s just so heartbreaking and sad, and I’m not sure there’s another film that’s so accurately or sensitively conveyed a person’s haunting emotional wounds with such authenticity.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that despite a miserable opening, “Anora” ultimately won me over. This is a flawed but compelling story about a woman reclaiming her agency, confronting the societal labels placed on her, and finding something profoundly human in a world that seeks to strip her of it.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

  "content": "Sean Baker's Oscar-winning \"Anora\" presents a peculiar paradox of contemporary cinema: a film celebrated for its supposed boundary-pushing that ultimately offers little beyond its taboo subject matter. At 139 minutes, Baker's tale of a sex worker who briefly marries into Russian wealth before facing brutal rejection stretches a thin premise far beyond its natural breaking point.\r\n\r\nMikey Madison delivers a performance of remarkable depth, finding nuanced humanity in a character that the screenplay itself seems uninterested in fully exploring. Her work transcends the material, suggesting emotional complexities the script merely gestures at. Madison deserves every accolade for creating a compelling person where the screenplay offers only a situation.\r\n\r\nThe film's moments of genuine comedy provide welcome relief but highlight the fundamental problem: \"Anora\" mistakes setting (sex work) for substance. When compared to Jean-Luc Godard's \"Vivre sa Vie,\" which used prostitution as a lens to examine profound questions of autonomy, capitalism, and gender, Baker's film feels superficial. Godard achieved more philosophical depth in 83 minutes than Baker manages in over two hours.\r\n\r\nContemporary cinema increasingly confuses progressive subject matter with progressive thinking. Merely depicting marginalized experiences without offering fresh insight or formal innovation becomes a hollow exercise. One cannot help but wonder whether \"Anora\" received accolades for what it attempted to say rather than what it actually achieved.\r\n\r\nThe central narrative - a woman from difficult circumstances discovering she can be loved for herself - is neither original nor developed with particular insight. What might have been a focused, powerful short film instead becomes a meandering feature that suggests profundity without delivering it.\r\n\r\nBaker's technical competence is evident, but technical skill alone cannot disguise the absence of a compelling artistic vision. \"Anora\" ultimately represents cinema that has forgotten the difference between depicting life and illuminating it.",

  "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nLiving in Portugal has a ton of pros, but regarding movies, it lacks serious advantages. The price of admission is expensive, there is only one film theater in my city (every time I want to watch a movie on IMAX or Dolby Atmos, it's a financial effort and time-consuming) and the worst of all, a whole bunch of films aren't released in their original date, especially November/December Oscar-bait movies. Only now I had the opportunity to see Green Book, and I am so mad I wasn't able to write its review in 2018 because this is undoubtedly the best comedy-drama of last year and one of the best overall!\r\n\r\nWith the help of a terrific cast, Peter Farrelly and his writing crew (which counts with Vallelonga's son, Nick) deliver what I think is the best screenplay of 2018. I can't remember the last time I cried of so much laughter in a film. I can't remember the last time I did the latter and still got emotional with the dramatic arc. This comedy-drama sent me through a roller coaster of emotions I wasn't expecting, at all. I went in anticipating outstanding performances (check) and solely that. Since 2019 has already begun, I'm watching the Oscar-bait movies with no real hopes of being utterly amazed.\r\n\r\nHowever, Green Book completely took me by surprise. I genuinely don't know why everyone was so shocked when it won Best Screenplay at the Golden Globe Awards. It possesses such a well-written story, filled with brilliant narratives about the most sensitive subjects. It takes the two main characters and elevates their individual arcs into subplots where you begin and end with two completely different personas. It's an extremely relevant film that shows how our world evolved and fought back racism and discrimination, without ever becoming too dark or even dull. It's not more of the same, it's not another movie produced exclusively to send a social message and catch some Oscar nominations. It's a truly captivating story of how two men can change their perspective of another race or even the entire world, by actually spending time with another culture and ignoring preconceived notions.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this well-structured, beautifully-directed and cleverly-written film would be just \"good\" if not for the two incredible actors, who take this movie to a whole other level. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali have such compelling chemistry that I wouldn't mind watching them interact for two hours on a car trip. Every single car sequence either produces hilarious moments, filled with tearful laughter, or it drastically changes into a more dramatic and emotional tone, subtly touching delicate topics. I knew Mortensen had a humorous side to him, but I never saw this coming! His timing, his expressions, his Italian accent, his body movements, everything about his performance is perfect. He absolutely nailed his part, by giving me the best time I had at a film theater in a long time, and his Oscar nomination is more than fair. He made a 130-min feature movie feel like a short flick.\r\n\r\nAli doesn't come far behind. Obviously, since Viggo has a funnier role to portray, the audience members might feel that he's just there to help his co-star shine, but he does much more than that. Since he brings the drama element to the story, he has a more restrained performance during the first half of the film. However, once Shirley starts getting along with Tony Lip, Ali gradually offers more and more splendid acting moments. He's definitely a supporting actor, but God is he a phenomenal one! Linda Cardellini (Dolores Vallelonga), even though she's only on-screen for a few minutes spread throughout the runtime, also delivers a great performance.\r\n\r\nTony Lip and Dr. Don Shirley have quite distinct personalities, besides being from different races. Each character's arc is brilliantly illustrated by Peter Farrelly, who gradually shows how Tony and Don are changing their view of the world and of each other's culture. Either through the witty car sequences or through unfortunate and horrible experiences, these two characters carry the audience on a journey of growth. Change in behavior, mindset and preconceived ideas, by sharing their own culture with another. Even though they were born in different countries and lived through distinguished lifestyles, with contrasting quality of life, they eventually start realizing that what they think of the world and everything else might not be entirely right.\r\n\r\nTechnically, Farrelly controls the movie's pacing exceptionally well, by making a two-hour-ish film feel like half of it. Remarkably-balanced tone and some great cinematography is showed in a couple of scenes. Consistently-filmed and well-edited, even though the latter has small hiccups here and there. Nevertheless, this isn't a film with extraordinary technical attributes, nor it needs them. Farrelly only needed to do \"ok\" with the producing and filming of a standout screenplay to achieve a fantastic result, and that's exactly what he did.\r\n\r\nFinally, regarding the controversy surrounding this movie ... See how easy it is to watch a film without being affected by outside matters which don't have a single thing to do with the movie itself? I don't care if someone who worked in the film tweeted something wrong today, let alone years ago. I don't care if someone misinterprets Viggo Mortensen's speech about racism. I don't care if the family of Don Shirley doesn't like how the movie approaches his way of being or his way of life. I don't care if the story isn't 100% true, as long as it succeeds in transmitting the vital message it wants to deliver, while actually being a good film. So, please, stop trying to listen to everything everyone says about a movie or the people working on it, especially nowadays, where chaos is easy to create.\r\n\r\nGreen Book surprised the hell out of me and left me speechless in the end. One of the best comedy-dramas I've seen in a long time, one of the best films of 2017 and, by far, the best original screenplay of the last year. Peter Farrelly and his fellow co-writers delivered a seamlessly-written story, filled with wonderful character arcs and with a quite important message to the audiences around the world. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali deliver award-worthy performances, especially the former who shows his incredible comedic timing and dramatic range. Still, the most compelling and emotional scenes come from Ali, and he does not deserve to be forgotten. I thought 2018 was going to be the first year without me giving an A+, but guess what ...\r\n\r\nRating: A+",

  "content": "\"Frequently, when someone tries to portray the overwhelming decade of the 1960s, they usually misuse the concept of discrimination towards African Americans, which is accurate to describe this social issue. Nevertheless, the way Peter Farrelly and staff go into detail about this social wretchedness embodying the psychological impact it has in the main character makes the film an outstanding one\".\r\n\r\nThe year is 1962, and the film begins inside Copacabana restaurant where we get introduced the imposing personality of Tony Lip, an Italian descendant whose family came from a lower middle class coping with some financial difficulties. The way Viggo Mortensen performs the character is a proper model of then American racism; therefore he attempted to keep them out until the occasion arrived and Don Shirley appeared in his path, offering him a two-month lifetime opportunity. We all need to bear in mind the precise dates because, in real life, it was nearly a year they spent together. Despite his gifted pianist skills and his upper-class status, he was still a victim of the convulsed cultural impact. Both of them, during the film, learn from each other and fight against the unsettling behaviour of determined people. \r\n\r\nAlthough it may seem simple, their interaction is one of the primary reasons why it succeeds. Believe it or not, it arouses curiosity, reaches the climax when they finally let them know as they are, and sometimes it results as a plot twister due to the radical temperament change of each actor. It has been ages since I watched such a pleasant film; afterwards, I felt refreshed as though it renewed me.\r\n\r\nThe contextualisation was imperative to build up each one's personality; moreover, it was visually dazzling owing to the costumes, the space and the background advertisement of the decade. Comedy is present as well so that you won't be missing from genuine laughs. Everything appears to be perfectly balanced, even the role of secondary personages such as Tony's wife and the cheeky cards experience. I'm chuffed to bits!\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the film \"Green Book\" is an exceptional example of the conception of a masterpiece without spending loads of money in production and without creating plenty of trifling scenarios.\r\n\r\n\r\n[85/100]",

  "content": "I have to say that this was a rather “meh” experience. It certainly was not an improvement over the original. Why try to rewrite a story that was actually not bad when you cannot be bothered to spend some effort on it? The new story is sloppy and it is rather clear that whoever wrote it got only two directives: Make sure that Megan Fox gets a lot of focus and if you do not know what to write then cram in some special effects. There are a lot of special effects in this movie!\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that Megan Fox’s ego have had a lot of influence on the movie. To the extent that you might wonder if this movie is about the turtles or about Megan Fox. She might be the wet dream of some less discerning teenagers but her acting skills leaves somewhat to be desired. Okay, okay she was actually not too bad in this movie but then it was not to difficult to shine in this movie either.\r\n\r\nThere are a few moments when it looks like it is going to turn interesting. For instance when the shredder is first introduced and punishes some of his underlings but rather quickly he is reduced to just another “special effect” when they slap this robotic shredder suit onto him. Come on, he is supposed to be a skilled martial arts combatant, not some freak in a robotic suit.\r\n\r\nSplinter was just sad. Some lab rat that picked up martial arts from a book he found in the sewers! What the f…? That ruined a lot of the movie.\r\n\r\nThe turtles themselves, being already pushed back somewhat into the background by Megan Fox desire to be in front of the cameras most of the time, are bland to say the least. They are immature, even for a movie like this, and the jokes are simply unintelligent and mostly not very funny.\r\n\r\nI was about to write that, if you like special effects and do not care for much of the rest, then you will probably like this movie but when I think back even the special effects where often only mildly interesting. They were perhaps not really bad but not very impressive either. The truck ride down a snowy slope was just silly and some of the scenes where actually rather underwhelming for instance.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, to me, this was a mildly entertaining movie that could have been much better if someone with basic intelligence had been asked to write the script in the first place. There are actually five (!) people credited with writing this movie and maybe that is the problem. Too many cooks!",

The animation is enjoyable to watch, the writing is quickly-paced and quite wittily observational at times and the characters - especially \"Sully\", are creatively personified and engaging. Luckily, the yelling brats are kept to a minimum and what we end up with is a sort of, well, love story. It has all the usual Pixar/Disney messages of loyalty and teamwork - only this is depicted with much more playfulness and we've even got a yeti with a never-ending supply of snow-cones!",

As increasing police and media pressure mount, the facade of a loving and blissful union crumbles and amidst the lies and behavior of Nick, the question remains - did he kill her?\r\n\r\nDavid Fincher is a true master class when it comes to directing, because Gone girl is one of the best films of this year.\r\n\r\nBen Affleck was perfect for this role, because Ben Affleck through out he's career had a lot of hate from the media and the critics that mostly slammed him in every role that he was in. And that's why he was outstanding in this movie.\r\n\r\nRosamund Pike acting in this film was pure brilliant and spectacular. She was so good in this role she might get a Oscar nomination for this. Tyler Perry in this movie was actually pretty damn good, and am so surprise saying that because Mr. Perry was in such awful films like: MADEA trilogy, Alex cross and the list goes on. But in this movie he did good.\r\n\r\nWhat this movie does so brilliantly well is how we view media today, because most of the stories you hear on the news might not be true and how the media can spread lies about people and ruining their lives. Everybody always believes what the media says even if it's true or not, because we don't know what that person on the news is going through, and this movie got that message out they so perfectly.\r\n\r\nMy only problem with this movie is Neil Patrick Harris character. Now let me just say that Neil Patrick Harris wasn't terrible in the movie, but his character to me slowed the film down.\r\n\r\nOverall Gone Girl is a fantastic film.",

  "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nThis is it. The last David Fincher's film I'll be able to review before Mank, his next masterpiece… I hope. I've been through Se7en, Fight Club, Zodiac, The Social Network, and now it's time for Fincher's latest installment, Gone Girl. Clearly, Fincher loves to work with people he knows. Jeff Cronenweth has been his director of photography in half of his movies, same for Kirk Baxter as part of the editing team, and Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross in the musical score. Even his production designer, Donald Graham Burt, has been around since Zodiac. However, Fincher always works with a different writer, and this time, he partners up with a debutant screenwriter, Gillian Flynn, author of the original novel that originates this adaptation.\r\n\r\nUsually, when it comes to writers, I take this change of media with a grain of salt since writing a book isn't exactly the same as writing a screenplay (it's completely different, I was being generous). With that said, Flynn absolutely destroys my self-doubts, delivering one of the best scripts of 2014. From the exceptionally captivating, perplexing disappearance of Amy to the underlying theme about how press and media treat this type of news, Flynn's screenplay is impressively able to develop each and every narrative in the most perfect way possible. With a remarkable use of time/date stamps, the viewer follows in a detailed manner the events that build up to the tragic day through different perspectives, mainly Amy's and Nick's.\r\n\r\nThis story's greatest accomplishment is how it makes the press influence what the viewer thinks about the characters, just like in real life. Nowadays, people don't even click to read the full article and understand its context. A single headline, as far from the truth as it might be, is enough to start a worldwide online debate. The same goes for television networks, and their news shows: if it's on the national news program, then it must be true, people think. I may be wrong when I wrote the whole \"change of media\" matter before, but of this, I'm sure: take every news article you read with a grain of salt because most of the time, the full, true story isn't entirely revealed.\r\n\r\nThis takes me to Ben Affleck (Justice League, The Way Back) and what I consider one of the best casting choices of the respective decade. In case you don't know, Affleck has been pursued throughout his whole life by journalists who try their hardest to expose his personal life, no matter how disrespectful it may turn out to be. Nick goes through the exact same obstacle. There's non-stop news about Amy, and it only becomes a matter of time until Nick starts being accused of being a terrible husband, and ultimately the obvious killer, even though the press can't find a single proof. Affleck doesn't even need to incorporate a new character since he has the necessary life experience to offer an utterly brilliant performance. Definitely, one of my favorite actors working today.\r\n\r\nSince I'm in the realm of performances, I might as well continue with Rosamund Pike (Radioactive). Her interpretation of Amy is almost the opposite of Affleck's, in the sense that the latter gives a seemingly simple yet powerful display, while Pike has a much more complex, layered role. She can be menacing and scary but also loving and kind. The puzzle surrounding her disappearance is mostly based on a perspective enigma, as the viewer is told the same story through different lenses throughout the first half of the film. Honestly, this is probably a career-best performance for Pike, who portrays a character of extremes, allowing her to demonstrate her jaw-dropping emotional range.\r\n\r\nCarrie Coon (Margo Dunne) is another actress I've grown to deeply enjoy watching, and she's terrific as Nick's sister. Her chemistry with Affleck is spot-on, and I sincerely hope that one day she becomes one of the most coveted actresses in Hollywood. Tyler Perry (Tanner Bolt) is also pretty great as Nick's lawyer, but Kim Dickens is even greater as Detective Rhonda Boney, who partially plays the same role as the viewer by trusting that what she sees and hears is undoubtedly the ultimate truth. Flynn's screenplay is packed with twists and turns, some of them more surprising than others, but the third act saves an unexpected, shocking turn of events, leading to a powerful ending that will leave most audiences speechless, myself included.\r\n\r\nTwo minor issues. One of them, you probably have already figured it out since I left Neil Patrick Harris (Desi Collings) out of the cast compliments above. Harris is fine as the character he portrays, but I can't help but feel that he wasn't the right actor for the role. This is a classic Fincher movie: dark, somber, depressing, tragic, and with its own share of violence and blood. In fact, it possesses one of the most disgusting, disturbing uses of blood in a single scene I've ever seen. Harris is an excellent actor, but he stands out from the rest of the cast, and not in a positive way. Again, fine performance, just not the right role for him. The other problem is admittedly an irrelevant nitpick regarding a few details story-wise that stretch the believability of everything just a bit.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this is still a phenomenal film, and it's another evidence of David Fincher's masterful visual filmmaking. Once again, Fincher works with his known crew members to create a sumptuous look and feel. With seamless editing, a memorable score, and fantastic camera work, Gone Girl is technically magnificent, but it's Gillian Flynn's debut screenplay that steals the spotlight. Boasting jaw-dropping twists, including an utterly shocking third act and respective ending, Flynn's narrative is incredibly engaging due to its remarkable structure and puzzling mystery, never losing an inch of excitement or interest. Ben Affleck is one of the best casting choices of the decade by interpreting a man whose life is deeply affected by the press and media, which should never be fully trusted (a clear and powerful message to the audience), while Rosamund Pike delivers her career-best performance with an emotionally devastating display. Despite the misstep of casting Neil Patrick Harris in such a dark movie and a couple of nitpicks regarding the investigation, everything and everyone else turn this into one of the best films of the 2010s.\r\n\r\nRating: A",

  "content": "**An excellent film, which never leaves us comfortable and where nothing is as it seems.**\r\n\r\nThis is one of those films that can unnerve and exasperate us, but that we love to watch. In fact, I don't remember seeing many films where the main character deserved my hatred. I don't want to, and I won't reveal what happens in this film, but it's one of those where appearances can be deceiving and where things aren't what they seem. The action focuses on the disappearance of a woman and her husband's efforts to find her. To our eyes, it's obvious that he really wants to find her, perhaps more than her parents, who seem to be just taking the opportunity to publicize the children's books they've published. However, little by little, he becomes a suspect in a hypothetical murder case.\r\n\r\nDavid Fincher is a director who has already shown what he's worth: I loved “Se7en”, “Game”, “Fight Club” and “Zodiac”, but I didn't really like “Social Network”, or “Benjamin Button”. In this film, he directs skillfully, but not without debatable choices: for me, the story's most important twist all comes too soon, and the ending is lazy, overly sudden, and makes it feel like the film was cut short before the end. The rest is incredibly well done and works wonderfully, and the film is a gradual construction where the details are fundamental and very well-thought-out.\r\n\r\nI really liked Ben Affleck's work. For me, it is one of the best films the actor has made to date. We feel his commitment, the way he develops the character and allows himself to appear increasingly distressed, submissive, without a will of his own, like someone who is living a nightmare and just wants it all to end. Alongside this renowned actor is Rosamund Pike, an authentic ice maiden accustomed to the most frigid roles we can imagine. She is not one of my favorite actresses, she is one of those that I consider not very versatile, but she gave everything that her character asked for: coldness, an intelligent and sharp mind, extreme physical and emotional self-control, a calculating spirit and a sweet and angelic face. Among the supporting cast, we have well-selected names, such as the friendly Tyler Perry, a very focused and rational Carrie Coon and a sinister Neil Patrick Harris.\r\n\r\nTechnically, I believe it is fair to highlight the intelligent use of cinematography, which is almost never warm and pleasant. There are scenes where we see this, right at the beginning, where things were going well for Affleck's character, but the essence of the film is made with a cold, uncomfortable color palette and scarce, hazy or artificial light. The film never makes us comfortable and creates its dramatic tension solidly. The sets and costumes also contribute, with that huge house for just one couple, with few signs of human warmth and joy. Finally, the soundtrack adds a sinister and deeply atmospheric touch that cannot be ignored.",

  "content": "\"Nick\" (Ben Affleck) is seemingly happily married to the gorgeous and witty \"Amy\" (Rosamund Pike) until he comes home one evening and finds a smashed table and no wife. The cops turn up with \"Boney\" (Kim Dickens) and \"Gilpin\" (Patrick Fugit) soon smelling a rat. Together with her parents, they do all the usual publicity stuff but to no avail. Then the police start to wonder if he's telling the truth, and that suspicion is only heightened when they discover some deliberately left breadcrumbs that begin to suggest that he is a bit of a cheating brute and that she was terrified he was going to kill her. As evidence mounts, you wouldn't put your money on \"Nick\" so with the support of his no-nonsense sister \"Margo\" (Carrie Coon) he engages acclaimed lawyer \"Bolt\" (Tyler Perry) and they start digging. They are ill-prepared for the truth that they actually do discover, though not as ill-prepared as \"Collings\" (Neil Patrick Harris). As we learn more about who did or didn't do what to whom, we find ourselves immersed in quite an complex web of lies, deceit and downright evil. For my money, this is Affleck's best film as his character has more skin in the game and as the tension mounts he sweats the story for all it's worth. Pike is also on great form as the fiendish \"Amy\" who is perfectly capable of manipulation on a fairly grand scale. There are also quite a revealing series of cameos from Reece Witherspoon's television chat show host who's motto ought to be \"never let the truth get in the way...\" The self-adaptation of her novel allows both Gillian Flynn and David Fincher to squeeze the juice from an ensemble cast that play to just about every toxic form of sexist stereotype the media can concoct and peddle. To be honest, I didn't love the denouement. Somehow I felt it let this whole carefully plotted and crafted exercise down a bit, but for the preceding 2½ hours it really does hold your attention.",

(And I'm a fan of the \"Star Trek\" universe!) The claustrophobic feel of the \"Nostromo\" is due to \"filming inside of a tube\" location shooting next seen in \"Das Boot.\" \r\n\r\nA band of \"space truckers\" are awakened from hibernation, and are shocked to find that they are only half way home. The Company orders them to investigate an Alien transmission, which sets up a descent into Hell as the crew finds themselves being stalked by an opportunistic \"Exomorph.\" As the crew is picked off one by one, the true nature of the beast and the odd attitude of the Science officer, Ash, raise the anxiety level over 100%.\r\n\r\nWhat sets this tale apart from other \"space monster\" films is the character of Third officer Ripley, who raises uncomfortable questions to Capt. Dallas about company policy in general and Science officer Ash in particular. After Capt. Dallas disappears, take-charge-female-Ripley discovers Ash's true intentions and leads her diminished crew to action.\r\n\r\n The level of violence has been described as \"near pornographic,\" which is helped along by H.R. Giger's \"worst nightmare\" mature Alien. This is the first of a memorable franchise, featuring a strong female leader that continues into the \"Prometheus\" prequel.(?)",

  "content": "There is a clause in the contract which specifically states any systematized transmission indicating a possible intelligent origin must be investigated... \r\n\r\nAlien is directed by Ridley Scott and written by Ronald Shusett and Dan O'Bannon. It stars Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, John Hurt, Yaphet Kotto, Ian Holm and Harry Dean Stanton. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Derek Vanlint.\r\n\r\nThe space merchant vessel Nostromo receives an unknown transmission as a distress call and land on the moon where the call had come from. Bad idea...\r\n\r\nBack on release it was one of the most talked about movies of 1979, backed by a  terrifically tantalising trailer - which itself was backed by one of the greatest tag-lines of them all, the weight of expectation of a genre blending classic was colossal. This was only after all director Ridley Scott's second feature length film, could a sophomore pic really be all that? History as we now know has proven that to be the case.\r\n\r\nOn plot synopsis it's standard format, where the haunted house and a killer on the loose has been replaced by a space ship in space. Yet once the pic plays its alien hand, and it becomes a battle of survival in one location, it dawns on you there is really no escape. No running into the garden and down the street, no hiding in the attic hoping the killer saunters off home, this is find and destroy or be destroyed yourself - with the future of mankind depending on the humans to succeed.\r\n\r\nSome still go into a viewing of Alien nowadays and decry it for being too much of a slow burn, yet this is one of the pic's biggest assets. Time in space is slow anyway, and lonely one would guess, so Scott wisely lets the characters be introduced, lets us understand just enough about their psychological make up before things go belly up (literally as it happens). When the pot finally boils over it's terrifying, the bar well and truly raised for horror/sci-fi hybrid  conventions.\r\n\r\nWith art design by H.R. Giger and Goldsmith producing eerie musical rumbles, the whole piece has a disquiet about it, notably with distressing sexual connotations and symbolism that haunts the mind as the body horror unfolds. The quiet passages are nerve shredders, Alien across the board is a visceral experience, especially for those who have ever watched it on a big screen in a darkened theatre.\r\n\r\nIt made a star of Weaver, who unbeknown to those on first viewing is the main character, another masterstroke by Scott, with Ripley the character in Weaver's hands shunting women's character's in big budget films forward by some considerable margin. All the cast are on great form, there's no showy stars in here, a collection of hard working British and American actors feeding off their director for super returns.\r\n\r\nNow 40 years old, Alien shows no sign of losing its classic status, and rightly show. A seminal class act that still holds all the qualities it had back in 1979. In space no one can hear you scream - indeed! 10/10",

However, the theme has already yielded many quality horror or thriller films. “Alien” is arguably the best, best-performed, and most enshrined and culturally significant of them all. It's one of those films that has already gone beyond cinematic issues to become a piece of art and culture that we all know, even people who never took the time to see it.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not worth wasting time explaining the plot around the “Nostromo”, a cargo ship with seven crew members who are decimated by a highly dangerous and carnivorous alien. The direction, in charge of Ridley Scott, is excellent, meticulous, attentive, and the story is intelligent, very well written and with well-developed and used characters. Contrary to what happens in other films, we see the characters trying to act as a team, and trying to solve an unexpected and dangerous situation. I never felt like they were acting in such a way as to almost purposefully put themselves in danger, which happens a lot in recent horror movies.\r\n\r\nSigourney Weaver made an excellent dramatic career after this film, which established her as an actress and opened doors for her in the industry. A deserved reward, given that she puts in her best efforts and gives this character all the resilience, humanity and charisma she deserves and needs. Despite the general quality of the cast being quite good, there are almost no actors capable of matching Weaver. As far as the technical aspects are concerned, the film has excellent cinematography (it even looks newer than it is) and really good special effects and visuals, considering that there is no CGI and that everything is done in the old-fashioned way. Finally, a word of praise for the iconic original score composed by Jerry Goldsmith.",

  "content": "\"Frozen,\" the latest Disney musical extravaganza, preaches the importance of embracing your true nature but seems to be at odds with itself.\r\n\r\nThe animated, 3-D adventure wants to enliven and subvert the conventions of typical Disney princess movies while simultaneously remaining true to their aesthetic trappings for maximum merchandising potential. It encourages young women to support and stay loyal to each other—a crucial message when mean girls seem so prevalent—as long as some hunky potential suitors and adorable, wise-cracking creatures also are around to complete them.\r\n\r\nIt all seems so cynical, this attempt to shake things up without shaking them up too much. \"Frozen\" just happens to be reaching theaters as Thanksgiving and the holiday shopping season are arriving. The marketing possibilities are mind-boggling. And in the tradition of the superior \"Beauty and the Beast\" and \"The Little Mermaid,\" surely \"Frozen: The Musical\" will be headed to the Broadway stage soon. The songs – which are lively and amusing if not quite instant hits—are already in place. \r\n\r\nLittle girls will absolutely love it, though. That much is undeniable. And the film from co-directors Chris Buck (\"Surf's Up\") and Jennifer Lee is never less than gorgeous to watch. A majestic mountaintop ice castle is particularly exquisite—glittery and detailed and tactile, especially as rendered in 3-D.\r\n\r\nBut first we must witness the tortured backstory of the film's princesses – not one, but two of them. The script from \"Wreck-It Ralph\" co-writer Lee, inspired by the Hans Christian Andersen story \"The Snow Queen,\" has lots of cheeky, contemporary touches but is firmly and safely rooted in Scandinavian fairy tale traditions.\r\n\r\nWhen they were young girls, sisters Anna and Elsa were joyous playmates and inseparable friends. But Elsa's special power—her ability to turn anything to ice and snow in a flash from her fingertips—comes back to haunt her when she accidentally zaps her sister. (Not unlike the telekinesis in \"Carrie,\" Elsa inadvertently unleashes her power in moments of heightened emotion.) A magical troll king heals Anna and erases the event from her memory, but as for the sisters' relationship, the damage is done.\r\n\r\nElsa's parents lock her away and close down the castle, which devastates the younger Anna. (Of the many tunes from \"Avenue Q\" and \"The Book of Mormon\" songwriter Robert Lopez and his wife, Kristen Anderson-Lopez, the wistful \"Do You Want to Build a Snowman?\" is by far the most poignant.) But once they reach adolescence and it's Elsa's turn to take over the throne at age 18, the two experience an awkward reunion.\r\n\r\nThe perky, quirky Anna (now voiced by a likable Kristen Bell) is a little nervous but overjoyed to see her sister. The reserved and reluctant Elsa (Broadway veteran Idina Menzel) remains distant, and with gloved hands hopes not to freeze anything and reveal her true self on coronation day. But a run-in with an amorous, visiting prince (Santino Fontana) who sets his sights on Anna triggers Elsa's ire, and she inadvertently plunges the sunny, idyllic kingdom into perpetual winter.\r\n\r\nFlustered and fearful, Elsa dashes away in a fit of self-imposed exile – which significantly weakens \"Frozen,\" since she's the film's most complicated and compelling figure. On her way to the highest mountain she can find, Elsa belts out the power ballad \"Let It Go,\" her version of \"I Am Woman.\" This soaring declaration of independence is the reason you want a performer of Menzel's caliber in this role, and it's the film's musical highlight. (Her flashy physical transformation from prim princess to ice queen does make her resemble a real housewife of some sort, however.)\r\n\r\nAfterward, though, the story settles in on Anna's efforts to retrieve her sister and restore order to the kingdom. Along the way she gets help from an underemployed ice salesman named Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and his trusty reindeer sidekick, Sven. They all meet up with a singing snowman named Olaf (a lovably goofy Josh Gad, star of \"The Book of Mormon\" on Broadway) who dreams of basking in the warmth of the summer sun. This \"Wizard of Oz\"-style quartet makes the obstacle-filled trek to the imposing fortress that awaits. (At least \"Frozen\" has the decency to borrow from excellent source material.)\r\n\r\nWhile the journey may seem overly familiar, the destination has some surprises in store. Some come out of nowhere and don't exactly work. But the biggie—the one that's a real game-changer in terms of the sorts of messages Disney animated classics have sent for decades—is the one that's important not just for the little girls in the audience, but for all viewers. http://newmoviestream.co/watch/2294629/frozen\r\nwish everything about the film met the same clever standard.",

  "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nSix years later, and Frozen has left an undeniable cultural impact. From Let It Go to tons of merchandising, Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee delivered such a memorable film that people not only didn’t forget but regularly asked for its sequel. As of right now, Frozen II has claimed the third-best animated opening weekend ever, proving that the love for this franchise (I think it’s safe to call it that already) is strong. However, how great is the original movie, after all? To be honest, I never fully watched it until this past week in preparation for its sequel. It surprised me in the sense that I didn’t expect to enjoy it as much as I did. Frozen is deserving of the love it possesses.\r\n\r\nWith extremely captivating characters, the story flows naturally, and the entertainment levels are always high. Whether these are due to the amazing singing sequences or to the exciting adventures, this film never stops having fun. That’s what Frozen ultimately is: a lighthearted, fun, and entertaining movie. It follows Disney’s formula for creating a variation of a story we have seen before. Characters go through a traumatic event when they’re young. They have to grow up while struggling with the aftermath of said trauma. Eventually, they overcome that obstacle and live happily ever after (or at least until the next installment).\r\n\r\nIt’s the generic and somewhat cliche Disney model for a new animated film (franchise). Nevertheless, don’t get me wrong: it works perfectly. Sure, it doesn’t bring anything new story-wise, but it’s still a great time. Despite some unnecessary and lazy exposition (the magical trolls are basically exposition devices), Frozen still delivers a truly captivating and visually jaw-dropping narrative. I do need to emphasize this: the animation is phenomenal. Elsa’s magic is seamless and beautiful. Arendelle is a gorgeous location, and the snowy mountains are impressively designed. Let It Go will always be remembered for its lyrics and melody, but the actual animated sequence is astonishing.\r\n\r\nEvery character carries a lot of expressiveness, which allows them to do basically everything. Frozen might not be a groundbreaking movie, but its compelling characters make the generic plot work. From Elsa and Anna’s complicated but heartwarming relationship to Kristoff and Sven’s camaraderie, I care about all of them… especially Olaf. I know, Olaf is simply the snowman version of a comic-relief character. He doesn’t really have a complex arc in need of extreme development. However, it’s impossible not to love him. He’s such a welcome presence in every single scene. Every single line of his is either a funny remark or a pretty valuable insight into something.\r\n\r\nCounting him out, every other character has a very well explored arc, mainly Elsa and Anna. Their (older) relationship originates from a plot point that might be a tad exaggerated, but it’s convincing enough. Finally, the score is as important as it is fantastic. It’s an animated musical, let us not forget about that. Obviously, Let It Go is the queen of all songs due to its catchy lyrics, memorable chorus, and significance to the character. But other ones such as Do You Wanna Build a Snowman and For the First Time in Forever also carry a sweet melody plus some exquisite character and story development. That’s what I love the most about musicals and why Disney always triumphs regarding this aspect: the way a simple song can tell so much about someone or move the plot forward. In my opinion, it’s the genre’s variation of “show, don’t tell.”\r\n\r\nIn the end, Frozen might not be a groundbreaking animated film story-wise, but it delivers around 100 minutes of pure fun and entertainment. With an exceptional voice cast (Idina Menzel, Kristen Bell, and Josh Gad are wonderful), Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee are able to take Disney’s formula and create a worthy variation of the classic blueprint. From the emotionally compelling and well-developed characters to the eyegasmic animation quality, Frozen is a good time from start to finish. Boasting some memorable and catchy songs, it became one of the decade’s culturally most impactful animated movies. I wish exposition wasn’t overused, and that more risks were taken concerning the screenplay, but as a Disney animated flick, it meets the company’s standards.\r\n\r\nRating: B",

Sure it probably got overhyped but that isn't the film's fault. It's a cracking watch, the pacing is absolutely spot on as are the musical numbers.\r\n\r\nWhat impresses me the most about the music is that it manages to keep the storytelling alive whilst it occurs. Particularly at the beginning there are loads of songs squeezed in next to each other, which could mess with the premise building but it doesn't - it actually enhances it. The songs themselves are terrific, with \"Let It Go\" obviously getting the most plaudits.\r\n\r\nIdina Menzel (Elsa) and Kristen Bell (Anna) are excellent in the lead roles, while Josh Gad almost steals the show as Olaf - very funny character! Of course it's aimed at the younger audience members, but it is still entertaining for us adult folk too - I've watched it a few times down the years and still thoroughly enjoy it.",

  "content": "OK, so it took me ten years and a persistent nephew to finally sit down before this, and though I didn't hate it, I really did struggle to see what all the fuss was about. It's a colourful adaptation of Hans Christian Anderson's \"Snow Queen\" story that sees Queen \"Elsa\" leave her kingdom after she almost kills her sister \"Anna\" - she has the ability to turn all before her to ice and that can be perilous at times for those around her! As she flees, upset, she accidentally leaves all in her kingdom with a rather frosty predicament. It now falls to \"Anna\" alongside her friendly snowman and her reindeer to try and get this pesky curse lifted. It skips along amiably enough with plenty of charming animation - especially from \"Olaf\" the snowman, but it's really about that one song that Edina Menzel delivers with a skill that, for my money anyway, is comfortably the best of these anthemic Disney power-ballads. I'm not sure even legendary lyricists Don Black and Richard Stilgoe have ever managed to incorporate \"fractals\" into their songs! As with so many of HCA's fairy tales, there is a darkness to the story - this one sanitises these aspects a little too much for me, but that said it still deals with issues of fear and deceit well enough for folks to get the message that perhaps having a frozen heart is not just a physical thing. Ten years on, it's still a decent watch that I suspect will continue to sustain youngsters for many a year to come.",

Scream is a love ballad to horror movie fans that intimately knows and zealously honors the legacy of terror-filled films that came before while creating something new, innovative, bold, and surprising.

  "content": "**_Scream delivered a breath of fresh air into the slasher franchise and holds up rather well nearly 30 years later._**\r\n\r\nThe plot of this film follows a cookie-cutter structure that models nearly all of the great slasher franchises of the late 1970s and early 1980s, but that is entirely the point. Scream is completely aware of the tropes of horror movies and utilizes them in a creative way by adding commentary and subtle comedy delivered by the characters throughout the film. It is not a full-fledged comedy by any means; there is no forced humor or jokes, but it is more of a dark comedy that pokes fun at itself in the background.\r\n\r\nThe performances from our main cast were great. Neve Campbell delivers an excellent badass performance and is the perfect lead for the franchise. She is capable of fighting back in a brutal way and rivals Laurie Stroud from Halloween as my favorite final girl of all time. Courtney Cox was quite good as well; she had limited screen time but was able to really make the most of it. David Arquette was okay; he did not blow me away by any means, and he is quite replaceable in my opinion. Matthew Lillard was my favorite of the film; his performance was over the top and quite mentally deranged, which worked really well. Skeet Ulrich was also quite good, but took a backseat to Lillard in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThe direction of this film was great. Wes Craven did an excellent job delivering unique shots and utilizing the camera angle and height quite well. I do think this movie needs a little more gore and violence for it being a slasher film. There was really only one kill that was quite memorable to me. For it being a homage and critique of the slasher genre, it was lacking quite a bit in the slash department. In addition, the runtime felt a bit bloated, and I think if this was cut down to maybe ten minutes, the viewing experience would have been better.\r\n\r\nOverall, I do think this movie is slightly overrated, but it is still a great film and worthy of its praise (for the most part).\r\n\r\n**Score:** _79%_ |\r\n**Verdict:** _Great_",

Christopher McDonald is solid too. It’s nice to see many returning faces from the original, even via the snippets of those no longer with us.

  "content": "**In the circle of romance, deceive and defraud.**\r\n\r\nThose who are into the world cinema, particularly the Korean, knows Park Chan-wook very well. But if you don't, then you must. His films are definitely for the grown ups. Like everybody else, my admiration for his work has started a decade ago with the film 'Oldboy'. He had tried his luck in Hollywood with 'Stoker'. Despite a good entertainer, it was criticised. I love Park Chan-wook doing hundred masterpieces like this in Korea than trying to do one in Hollywood. His ability to turn the good book into a great flick was phenomenal. Here it goes another one. This was based on the British novel 'Fingersmith' by Sarah Waters. The story of an orphan woman who assigned to be a maid for a young rich woman who is living under the shadow of her uncle since she has no parents.\r\n\r\nYeah, I was expecting it, but I did not think it would be another masterpiece from the director. I even thought the ratings could be exaggerated, and the reviews from his die hard fans like Nolan's or QT's fans does. The timeline of the story was prior to Second World War Korea under the Japan rule. A perfect setting for such theme. The film opened like it is an average film. That's where all I got wrong. Or probably I judged it too soon. The storytelling was split into three parts and the first part was a bit mix of fun and like any film, introduction, the platform for the rest of the narration filled with surprises.\r\n\r\nThe young orphan Sook-hee was recruited by a thief who is planning to trick a young woman named Lady Hideko with all the wealth left behind by her parents. The only obstacle for him is her uncle, a guardian. So Sook-hee becomes close to her. More than she had expected, but their plan is working. Now they have to wait for the perfect moment for a perfect strike. When it arrives, an unexpected twist takes the tale to go back to where the film originally had started. But even further earlier and this time, the perspective of the story was from the Lady Hdeko.\r\n\r\n> ❝So even if my love for you leads me to ruin, don't pity me.❞\r\n\r\nSo, with that flashback, the second part begins. But literally it was a series of twist, that keep explaining us in another angle of the whole scenario I had witnessed in the previous part. Believe me, I have never seen such a long twist before. I was like unmoved for that entire segment. One of the best things I have ever in a film. The praise must go to the author, but the director and his actors as well did a fine job. There's a twist in every scene. So, for that one must pay close attention to the first part, despite slow moving story.\r\n\r\nBut above all, what I'm surprised was I did not know it was a lesbian film. Moreover, I did not think it could have bold scenes for such theme. Everything seemed perfect. I mean the erotic parts are sensual, but very artistic than unnecessary disturbance. Mainly because of stronger hold of the story narration than anything else. Even the pace picks up, like a crazy speed. Everything about the film you would learn in this section. All the secrets of the past revealed and what might comes are still kept under mysterious for the third and final part.\r\n\r\nThe most awaited, the conclusion part begins forth. For everything we saw so far, what might come after makes this film at its best. Just like the mid part, this is also full of twists. Because it will going to tell who ends where and what they get. Over two hours long film, and every frame are worth. The casting was best and so the setting of the 1930s Korea. Especially I must applaud the filmmaker's effort to turn the original setting from Europe to East Asia. It was great, but still now and then you can see the influence of the original source. I mean western culture, names, architect references which might have come from the book.\r\n\r\nNot just the lesbian or a love triangle story, but something like a circle of love with deceive and defraud. You can notice that in the film poster with four main characters. So when it has a multiple strings attached, you could expect surprises/twists from each angle and it gives that more the convincingly. Put this into your must see list. This is not the first screen adaptation, but surely the best so far. Now we can expect a European or a Hollywood project in a big scale soon. Believe me the Oscars would pour in, because it's that kind of story. Highly recommended!\r\n\r\n_8/10_",

  "content": "Talk about the best laid plans! This is a cracking, sexy, thriller set in Korea during the Japanese occupation of the 1930s. It centres around the charming, butter-wouldn't-melt \"Sook-Hee\" (Tae Ri Kim) who takes a job attending the wealthy \"Lady Hideko\" (Kim Min-hee). She lives on a grand estate with her cantankerous uncle \"Kouzuki\" (Cho Jin-woong) and is frankly rather low maintenance for her new maid. Pretty quickly, though, we begin to smell a rat! Is she what she seems, and what has the obviously duplicitous \"Count\" (Ha Jung-woo) got to do with things? Well gradually, we find out that there are schemes afoot to rob the lady of her fortune, her liberty - even her mind. What the plotting didn't take account for, though, was human nature. A bond gradually starts to build between the two women, a bond of friendship, of trust - of love! What happens next...? This benefits hugely from having a tightly-knit cast who work well together; a solid and intriguing story that marries the Machiavelian with the mischievous, the sexy with the sordid - and, it looks great too. The characters vacillate from being likeable, kinky, and often pretty loathsome in equal measure, but somehow there is always a sense that right will be done! I loved the ending, and the performances from the two women are engaging and captivating. Some of it isn't for the squeamish, but it flew by, is expertly crafted, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",

  "content": "Be prepared for the worst, but hope for the best. Pray for the best, but prepare for the worst. \r\n\r\nPrisoners is directed by Denis Villeneuve and written by Aaron Guzikowski. It stars Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Viola Davis, Terence Howard, Maria Bello, Melissa Leo and Paul Dano. Music is by  Jóhann Jóhannsson and cinematography by Roger Deakins.\r\n\r\nWhen Keller Dover's (Jackman) daughter and her friend go missing, he takes matters into his own hands...\r\n\r\nAt first glance of the plot synopis, one could be forgiven for thinking this is yet another revenge thriller filled out by police procedural side-bars. How pleasant to find that Prisoners has more to offer than a simple who is the criminal? And just how far will a vengeful father go to satiate his grief?.\r\n\r\nPrisoners is such an apt title because all the main players here are trapped by either mental fragility or victims of their innocence, guilt or chaotic impulses. It's a multi stranded character piece that poses many questions, while of course it has a big mystery element. The narrative features a whole host of clues that might be something, or not, unanswered questions dangle throughout until the finale reveals thge edgy secrets.\r\n\r\nIt's safe to say that the themes at work here are dark and upsetting, with the core abduction thread siddling up against horredous back stories, torture and religious mania. Gruzikowski's screenplay is quality, mesmerising even, there's no lazy filler or extranous sequences, even as the jigsaw pieces are put together in the last quarter, you may find yourself wondering how you missed something so simple?.\r\n\r\nThis was Villeneuve's first English language picture, and it's not hard to see why he was highly touted as one of the next big director beings - his output that followed subsequently bears this out. His control of mood and pacing is superb, his garnering of high quality perfs from his cast (notably Jackman and Gyllenhaal) is impressive, and his teaming with the great Deakins is a match made in photographic heaven.\r\n\r\nThis is adult film making, a thriller designed to illicit emotional responses from the audience. Relentless and powerful, a troubling examination of the human conditioning in various guises - and we are witnesses. 9/10",

  "content": "Prisoners is a carefully constructed labyrinth, deceptively simple and very clever. The material was nothing new even when the film was released, but director Denis Villeneuve (pre-Dune) and screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski work a few unexpected twists and turns into their maze to keep us on our toes. The key element, however, is Hugh Jackman’s career-best performance as Keller Dover, a father whose patience for police work quickly runs thin when Detective Loki (the always effective Jake Gyllenhaal) fails to find Dover’s kidnapped little daughter.\r\n\r\nIt will surprise no one that Dover decides to take the law into his own hands, recruiting Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard), his best friend whose daughter has also gone missing, to kidnap the only suspect – whom the police has ruled out for the moment –, take him to an abandoned house, and beat a confession out of him. This is par for the course in the movies, but is it realistic? Can a father, however desperate he may be, really go from zero to psycho in no time flat?\r\n\r\nThe film makes this transition 50% more believable by making the character a committed survivalist, meaning that he was halfway there all along. And even if we still found it hard to believe, Jackman would just browbeat us into believing it with a sadistic, ballistic, animalistic skin-shedding, raw nerve-baring performance wherein he doesn't just go berserk; he goes full on Beserker.\r\n\r\nIn some twisted way, all this makes sense; the antagonist or antagonists are just as crazy as Dover, if not more: making children disappear is their way of “making war with God”. With that in mind, who better than a monster to find a monster? Dover may not in fact be too far off either, or is he? In one of those twists I mentioned, the movie toys with the Law of Economy of Characters by casting Paul Dano as the mentally challenged man on whom Dover’s suspicions (and fists, among other objects) fall.\r\n\r\nGyllenhaal’s work is as strong Jackman’s, but more subtle and nuanced; he gives his Loki an eye tic which lets us know that, although he has solved all his cases, and belying his usual calm and collected demeanor, he has not gotten to where he is without some traumas of his own.",

  "content": "Prisoners is a largely generic revenge / suspense / mystery \"they have my kid\" tale with a predictable plot that gives itself away too early. No attempt at realism, this is Scooby-Doo style investigation - lie detectors are treated seriously, \"bad guys\" are largely 1-dimensional with poorly explained motives designed to surprise rather than give insight, etc.\r\n\r\nIt tries to make up for this in a few ways: a) bump up the intensity of scenes (comes across forced and awkward), b) add extra violence and dark semi-religious symbolism (seems out of place and largely meaningless), and most importantly c) maintain an air of mystery by throwing left-field plot points at you every 3-5 minutes to keep your attention. \r\n\r\nIf you carefully note the clues, about half way through the film it strongly indicates the finale. After that the air of mystery that keeps the film feeling suspenseful largely dissolves and you are left with what feels like a AI-generated script desperately trying and failing to throw you off the initial clues.\r\n\r\nThe film's greatest redeeming quality is its attempt to turn some revenge film character archetypes on their head. It is not always successful, but the attempt to break cliches is always welcome! I suspect a much better film will be inspired by this.",

  "content": "If proof were needed of the versatility of both Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal then this film has to be it. Jackman delivers what can only be described as a visceral performance here as “Keller” (HJ) and his family prepare to celebrate Christmas. Right from the start, we sense their’s a bleak and chilly town, but the family atmosphere as daughter “Anna” (Erin Gerasimovich) and her best friend “Joy” (Kyla-Drew) are amongst friends enjoying their day. As times ticks on, though, he notices that the girls have gone AWOL. No amount of yelling or local searching is helping so the police are duly called in. That’s the purview of “Loki” (JG) who has unorthodox methods (and tattoos) and who not only has to try to find the girls but contain the increasingly unbridled anger of a father who will stop at nothing. Their first lead comes in the form of “Alex” (Paul Dano) whom you could say isn't quite the full shilling and who appears to know something. What, though? Interrogation reveals little but “Keller” isn’t convinced and so upon his release after the statutory forty-eight hours he takes matters into his own, brutal hands! Now “Loki” has more to investigate as he hones on on another suspect who keeps snakes on suitcases! With both men becoming exasperated by their lack of progress, which one - if either - will get a break that might track down the girls. The question writ lathe throughout is one of what wouldn’t you do for your child? The law is fine for everyone else, or when it gets results, but when it fails - even the most benign of souls can become a monster. Driven, vengeful, cruel and pretty damn useful with a hammer and some plumbing. In case you are wondering, there are twists and turns galore and although I did actually manage to guess who the villain of this piece was, the denouement itself is something really quite unexpectedly incomplete. The photography and the soundtrack both help capture the crescendoing frenzy that reminded me a little of “Psycho” (1960) and with delicately strong supporting efforts from Viola Davis and Maria Bello as the equally terrified mothers and from Terence Howard as the doubly conflicted “Franklin”, this is a powerful thriller that is unnerving pretty much throughout.",

Unfortunately for him, he encounters the sleepy-head sloth \"Sid\" whom he rescues from a pair of rhinos, only to bitterly regret his kindness as this pesky mammal is soon getting on his nerves. Meantime, a pride of sabre-toothed tigers are plotting revenge on a human village whose hunting parties have taken their toll on their now dwindling numbers.

The tigers still haven't given up hope of securing their rather meagre lunch, and \"Diego\" - a sort of wily and menacing character is charged with luring the party to an ambush at \"half peak\" where their trap will be sprung.... This is all fairly predictable fayre, to be honest. You just know that the initial hostilities will all mellow and that teamwork, resilience and loyalty will prevail. It's not without it's humour though, and there are some fun animated action scenes that use well the surrounding snowy scenarios. Personally I found it better when it was just the beasties, the human angle was a little dull and didn't really add much. Some good scoring mixing modern with classical styles, a bit of fun ice skating and \"Diego\" did rather enjoyably remind me of \"Scar\" from the \"Lion King\" (1994). I saw it on my own at a cinema this morning which was a shame - it's a solid story with some reasonable characterisations and the animation is efficient rather than ground breaking. Certainly it is all just a bit too derivative, but 20 years on, it still has traction and I did rather enjoy it.",

  "content": "Horror is baaaaack! \r\nAnd with a vengeance.\r\n\r\nThe Nun is not for people that don’t like horror movies or burnt out on them. Don't expect character development either. Don't expect to be shock like you were when you watched The Exorcist. I’ve read several critic reviews were they just don’t get it. They use words to describe it like “using every trick in the horror trope” or “predictable”, “throwing the kitchen sink at”, or “not enough character development”. Well forget what you heard because there is more bite to this movie than you’d expect. \r\n\r\nOkay, so we begin with a spooky opening sequence where two nuns are fighting to save humanity from a malevolent presence that is about to enter our world. One is dragged into a room and the other commits suicide by hanging. Suicide is a sin, right? Makes you wonder what type of evil is powerful enough to destroy Catholic nuns?\r\n\r\nBeing the beginning of The Conjuring movie universe, this story begins like this, Father Burke (Demién Bichir) is summoned by the Vatican to investigate the suicide of a nun at The Abbey, a castle located somewhere in Romania. Apparently Father Burke has a trauma and a shameful past after having failed to save a teen from an exorcism he performed. Makes you wonder why The Vatican would send a priest like Father Burke on such a dangerous mission. The Vatican doesn’t send Father Burke alone on this task though. They assign Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga), who hasn’t yet taken her vows. A nun that hasn't taken her vows yet, and not your typical nun either. She's contrary to the average nun. She seems so innocent.\r\n\r\nFather Burke and Sister Irene are taken to The Abbey by a local delivery man, Frechie (Jonas Bloquet). (You may remember Frenchie as the first exorcism performed by The Warrens from the original The Conjuring. Lorraine Warren has the painting of The Nun at their home and references it in the film.) Sister Irene was chosen to go on this assignment because she experiences visions, these visions provide the information needed to uncover what actually occurred at The Abbey.\r\n\r\nThe Abbey has been the site of a malevolent force locked away for centuries. The Church took over The Abbey and placed a congregation of nuns to pray 12 hours a day to keep the evil force in control. However, after WW2 bombing weaken the structure of The Abbey, the evil locked inside of it found another way to escape, and using the guise of a nun, slowly grows in strength causing terror on those around it. \r\n\r\nYes, The Nun is a supernatural survival horror installment of The Conjuring universe. You don’t have to be a die hard fan of the horror genre in order to be scared. Yes, there is a lot of the same tropes from the most popular supernatural horror movies and that is because this is how demonic infestation happens. \r\nDirector Corin Hardy and screenplay writer Gary Dauberman do wonderfully.\r\n\r\nWhat this film gives us is tricky camera and visual effects that showcase how the demon works. We find out that the demon’s name is Valak–an ancient demon from Hell that was summoned by the count performed sacrificial rituals. \r\nIf you are expecting character development then you’re not going to find it here. This story doesn’t need a lot of characters at all. You don’t need a lot of information about these characters because Valak is the only character this story is about.. One minute he’s behind the character’s back, the next his shadow appears on the wall, he reanimates dead corpses and even manifesting animals and the usual superhuman strength as well as taking on human form. He ghosts the characters as well. It’s always interesting to see how the director and screenwriter pull off these visual effects. \r\n\r\nFather Burke character plays like a detective searching the castle for any information he can use to exorcise the demonic spirit from the world while Sister Irene uses her visions to lead her to the truth about what occurred at The Abbey as well as discover anything that she can use to send the evil spirit back to Hell. If you like Ash from the Evil Dead horror series, then you’ll like Frenchie because he is the outsider in all of this providing necessary dark humor. Frenchie isn’t afraid to use a shotgun to blow off the heads of a couple of deadites disguised as nuns.\r\n\r\nWhat also makes this film enjoyable to watch with a group, is the pacing. There are enough slow moments for you to make jokes about the characters or the visual bombarding your senses.\r\n\r\nI give this film an enthusiastic 7/10 for its creepy mood and intense disturbing images. And those squeamish people, no worries. There isn't a lot of gore. \r\n\r\nDefinitely a great popcorn horror flick to watch in the dark with your friends. Definitely worth the movie ticket. You won't be disappointed as long as you keep what I've said in this review in mind.\r\nIf I were to rate its place among the other films in The Conjuring universe, I would rate as follows\r\n\r\n1) The Conjuring\r\n2) The Conjuring 2\r\n3) The Nun\r\n\r\n* 4) Annabelle Creation",

Sticking strictly to a formula that will either infuriate or satiate horror genre fans, \"The Nun\" delivers enough creepy boo-jump tropes to keep it above average. There's plenty of roaming about dark corridors and churchyards, with lanterns our only prominent saviours from the terrors of the dark. If, and it's a big if, you don't mind that Corin Hardy's film isn't trying to raise the bar for horror, and is in fact staying safe, then there's a decent enough good time to be had here. If you be one of those who constantly moans about bringing nothing new to the table, don't bother with this one, in fact, think of something new to bring to the table yourselves then... \r\n\r\nThe set-pieces hold up well enough (buried alive shiver shiver), the atmospheric dread only occasionally punctured by Abel Korzeniowski's bombastic score. The story is interesting enough, such as why the entity is bringing terror to the abbey, what is the link to the \"Warren\" family, and the backstory axis for Father Burke (Demián Bichir) brings another demonic layer to the plotting. While talking about \"bringing something new to the table\", for the first time in this series we actually get a bit of humour, mostly from Jonas Bloquet's likable Frenchie character. Taissa Farmiga holds the lead well, where she has a very appealing visual reaction style that will serve her well if she stays in genre mode. While Maxime Alexandre's cinematography (low lights and fogs) is a big improvement from \"Annabelle: Creation\" and is tonally compliant.\r\n\r\nThis formula has been done much better previously, such as Hammer's take on \"The Woman In Black\", but even then they were going on about new stuff being brought to the table etc etc etc. It is what it is, a boo-jump haunted house (buildings) picture that is there for those who like such things, who buy into it on that level. Is this a great film? Absolutely not, but it works on its intended terms and any expectation of a new branch of horror is going to have you crying over spilt blood. 6/10",

  "content": "Back in 1986, \"Take My Breath Away\" was ubiquitous. It had airplay everywhere and made the band \"Berlin\" an household name. That is just about all, I have to say, that is memorable about this otherwise rather dull, testosterone driven, airborne adventure movie that really doesn't show these military elite in much of a good light. \"Maverick\" (Tom Cruise) is the aptly named hot-shot who is sent to the \"Top Gun\" flying school for the top 1% of the top 1%, where his individual style - along side his co-pilot \"Goose\" (Anthony Edwards) - manages to irk just about everyone; especially his arch rival \"Ice\" (Val Kilmer). Who will win out in this ultimate of willie-waving exercises? Well if you can't guess that from the very start, then don't bother. I suppose this is meant to extol the virtues of pride and loyalty, but for the most part - for me anyway - this is the kind of movie that does those is the military no favours at all. The dialogue is frequently vulgar and puerile, offering us characterisations that are at best smug, at worst just plain irritating. Of course, there is a romance as our Levi-clad diminutive star hits it off with his tutor \"Charlie\" (Kelly McGillis); we have a little bit of tragedy and then, of course, a denouement that was simply never in doubt. Tony Scott has managed to deliver a film that is quickly paced, with plenty of decent action photography as the planes and the aircraft carriers do their stuff, but the substance to the characters and the acting itself - Kilmer and McGillis are really just acting by numbers - leaves this film to ride on it's handsome and mischievous star who does exude a certain charm, as he always does, and on it's AOR soundtrack that features many songs way more memorable than the movie. I appreciate that those more technically savvy have poked loads of holes in the detail of the film. I am not one of those folks, so I watched it the other day in the cinema on face value, and I can't say these flaws seem to matter too much to the overall look of the film. It's just that it's not really very good.",

  "content": "Building on the first volume, this self-adaptation by writer Mario Puzo and director Francis Ford Coppola develops the story of the new Don - \"Michael\" (Al Pacino). His attempts to expand, and to a certain extent legitimise, the family businesses see him associating with the duplicitous \"Hyman Roth\" (Lee Strasberg) in Cuba; subject to betrayal, assassination attempts and fighting what may be a losing battle to keep his own family together - all whilst doing plenty of Machiavellian manipulation of his own. There is an equally strong parallel thread depicting how his father \"Vito\" (Robert de Niro) rose to prominence after fleeing Sicily after the murder of his family at the hands of \"Don Ciccio\". With the principal characters all now well established, we can hit the ground running with a solid and complex set of inter-connected, character-driven storylines. The superior cast deliver this story really effectively - Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton as the consigliere and wife respectively, standing out. The attention to detail alongside the instantly recognisable Nino Rota score add amply to what is just a great story of Michael's efforts to build upon (and honour) his father's legacy, before he loses all of his own, once prevailing, decency. It is long, and it does miss Brando, but Pacino is on super form as the increasingly ruthless and isolated - even lonely - figure and I reckon this is every bit as good at the \"Godfather\" (1972).",

Mixed into this web is a private investigator (Martin Balsam), Marion’s sister (Vera Miles) and Marion’s secret beau (John Gavin).\r\n\r\nDirected by Alfred Hitchcock based on Robert Bloch’s book, “Psycho” made a huge impact when it was released in 1960. It contains a plot development that was groundbreaking at the time shared by England’s “City of the Dead” (aka “Horror Hotel”), which went into production six weeks earlier than “Psycho” and was released in the UK at the same time, but not in America until 2 years later. While they’re both good, “Psycho” is way superior. It was followed by three sequels (1983, 1986 and 1990), the last being a semi-prequel, all starring Anthony Perkins as Norman with Vera Miles returning for the first one.\r\n\r\nOne thing I don’t like is that it was shot in B&W. Check out the sequels and the 1998 remake to observe the same settings in living color.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 49 minutes and was shot primarily at the backlot of Universal Studios, Universal City, California, with other parts in Los Angeles & Gorman, California, and Phoenix, Arizona. \r\n\r\nGRADE: A",

Janet Leigh wants to make a go of things with her cash-strapped hunky boyfriend \"Sam\" (John Gavin) so when an unexpected opportunity arises at work that puts $40,000 in her lap, she skips town and takes refuge during a thunderstorm at the \"Bates\" motel where she encounters \"Norman\" (a very handsome looking Anthony Perkins). The rest you will just have to watch for yourself, but the story has just about everything you could want from a thriller: a fella with a bit of a \"mummy\" syndrome; some good old fashioned larceny; lust and though I didn't quite love the ending, it is a superbly dramatic piece of well considered and constructed cinema that cleverly builds on what is quite a simple story with a strong and convincing cast.

  "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nFirst of all, this is a spoiler-free review of Far From Home, but NOT of Avengers: Endgame! So, if you still didn’t watch the latter or heard what happens in it (by some inexplicable reason), this is a SPOILER WARNING for the events of that era-ending film. Moving on to the web-slinger, this sequel is everything it should be and a bit more. It beautifully encapsulates how everyone’s feeling about the central death of Endgame, especially Peter Parker. I wished Jon Watts would put a lot of focus into Spider-Man’s grief and I hoped that a big part of the plot would be him just having to deal with the fact that his mentor/father figure is gone. He can’t continue to just be the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. He needs to grow up and become what everyone expects of him: to be the best of them all.\r\n\r\nWatts does all of it. There are so many emotionally powerful dialogues featuring Nick Fury or Happy (Jon Favreau) or even just moments with Tom Holland just standing alone and having to breathe through the pain of losing someone you love. The pressure that everyone is putting on his shoulders is immense, maybe too much for a simple teenager, but he’s everything but simple. I love every single bit of story dedicated to Peter and Tony Stark’s (Robert Downey Jr.) relationship. Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers wrote a wonderful screenplay, and Jon Watts executed it seamlessly. However, the reason why all of this works is due to Tom Holland’s performance.\r\n\r\nHe said in an interview he would play Spider-Man until he can and until producers let him. I hope he stays around for years without end. He’s not only my favorite on-screen Spider-Man but my favorite on-screen Peter Parker as well. I love how he spends most of the movie holding on to his feelings, and in the last act, he just lashes out because he can’t take it anymore. He left my eyes close to tearing up in probably the best dialogue of the film with Happy. As a superhero, he perfectly embodies what Spidey is all about, and Holland has the plus of doing most of his action stunts. As a teenager, he’s incredibly funny, innocent, and he still doesn’t know how to deal with falling in love or having a crush, which leads me to the second of the three main storylines of this movie: his relationship with MJ. \r\n\r\nZendaya did get some criticism from fans who, well, don’t like the fact that MJ is not the same one as in Sam Raimi’s original trilogy (physically and psychologically). Same for Holland and the fact that this Spider-Man has a lot more “gadgets” than Tobey Maguire’s. For those people, I only have one advice: understand that this is a distinct universe with different takes on characters we know and with other stories to tell which are, in fact, the closest we had to the comics so far. The sooner you accept this, the easier will be for you to enjoy these films. Having that in mind, MJ didn’t have much to do in Homecoming. Actually, she was even played as a post-credits twist so that the sequel could focus more on her … and it did.\r\n\r\nTheir relationship gradually evolves throughout the movie smoothly and realistically. They’re teenagers! Having their first crush, trying to come up with a good time and place to tell the other they like them, being nervous when they’re together and being anxious when they’re separated … Watts handled this subplot very well. It didn’t feel forced (rom-coms should take some tips), Zendaya and Holland’s chemistry is palpable, and I love this new MJ. Most of the superhero’s lovers are the cliche damsel in distress, always needing saving and making dumb decisions. Zendaya’s MJ not only can handle herself, but she has an unique personality that makes her stand out.\r\n\r\nFinally, the third and last storyline relies on Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal). I can’t really get in-depth about this character because he has a massive impact on the narrative, but I can guarantee that Gyllenhaal makes this character work. I like how they approached Mysterio, but if it wasn’t for the outstanding actor that Gyllenhaal is, Far From Home would have suffered a bit. The relationship between him and Spider-Man is well-developed, but the character of Mysterio lacked better treatment. There’s an exposition dump midway through the runtime that’s just horrible. Really, really bad. However, the film moves on and gets better until it reaches the last 45 minutes, which are unbelievable.\r\n\r\nI will always prefer a slow start and a fantastic finish than the other way around. Far From Home struggles with the first two acts’ pacing, but the last one compensates that with some of the best action a Spider-Man movie ever had! There are so many sequences where our superheroes are just going at it, flying and swinging across buildings, bridges, and rivers like we’ve seen before, only better. The CGI looked like it could be excessive in the trailers, but instead, it’s some of the best Marvel has shown us. Nevertheless, the jaw-dropping scenes are some that involve illusions, very much like Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) had in his origin flick. Spider-Man has two memorable sequences (the VFX here are mind-blowing), one of which incorporates a certain superpower not seen in the MCU so far (officially, at least). The kid in me was smiling with pure joy, let’s write that.\r\n\r\nIt’s on par with Homecoming. One is better than the other in various areas, but they’re extremely different, so comparing them might be unfair. The first had the goal of introducing a “new” character to the MCU, so the focus relied solely on Peter Parker having to deal with his powers and being the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. This sequel is set so far away from the origin story and so much happened between these two that if people chose to watch them back-to-back, they wouldn’t understand much of what’s going on. Nevertheless, Far From Home still has its own issues.\r\n\r\nLike I wrote above, the first two acts struggle with its pacing. While it’s refreshing to watch Spider-Man in other cities besides New York, the transitions between them are ridiculously fast, especially one that takes Peter Parker to another country in such an illogical way. The film tries to play off these less rational moments with comedy bits quite often and sometimes it just doesn’t work, affecting both the tone and pacing. I liked Ned in Homecoming, and I also enjoyed his presence here, but this time he almost felt like just a comic relief guy instead of that essential “sidekick” to Spider-Man. Michael Giacchino’s score is good, but for some reason, I couldn’t really connect with it, which I think it’s the first time I don’t exactly love Giacchino’s themes. Finally, the comedy skits could be better, they don’t land that many times and the one supposedly funny scene I remember is the absolute worst.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I still had a blast! I think I prefer Far From Home to Homecoming since the latter deals with a much more complex and emotionally compelling story than the origin flick. The action is some of the MCU’s best and definitely as great as Spider-Man’s action ever was, featuring some mind-bending, astonishing sequences. The cast is brilliant, especially Tom Holland who cements his spot as the best on-screen web-slinger ever. Zendaya and Jon Favreau are also amazing, but I have to praise Jake Gyllenhaal’s performance because he’s just awesome every single time. It’s the movie the MCU needed after the tragic events of Endgame. It works because we feel what Peter Parker’s feeling and we can deal with our grief with the help of Spider-Man’s journey in this film. Aside from some minor problems with pacing, comedy, and exposition, the last act plus the two post-credits scenes, which have a tremendous impact on the movie and on what’s to come on Phase Four, are more than enough for you to go see this film at the theater. Don’t miss it!\r\n\r\nRating: B+",

I didn’t exactly regret having forked out the money to watch it in the cinema but that’s about it. It’s far from a great movie and the end scene…well it’s a typical really crappy Hollywood ending where the writer cannot be bothered to spend time creating something intelligent so he just goes for the usual sensationalist cliffhanger bullshit.\r\n\r\nAs with the previous movie, Spider-Man: Homecoming, this is a Spider-Man for kids, or at least younger people, movie which perhaps is part of why I am somewhat lukewarm towards it. This one did not feel as childish as the previous one but there is still a lot of teenage angst and rubbish in it. The plot is of course highly predictable as well.\r\n\r\nThe special effects on the other hand are quite good and essentially what makes the movie worth watching. At least to me. The end fight with hundreds of those drones flying around intermixed with Mysterio’s illusions where quite cool. A bit over the top perhaps but cool nonetheless.",

  "content": "I'd completely forgotten about \"Bad Boys for Life\" (2020) but luckily there are were few flashbacks to remind me that \"Mike\" (Will Smith) had been the target of a son he didn't know about - \"Armando\" (Jacob Scipio) - and that both he and partner \"Marcus\" (Martin Lawrence) risked life and limb to get him behind bars. Well now, a few years later, \"Mike\" has just got married; \"Marcus\" has had a revelatory out-of-body experience and their beloved \"Capt. Howard\" (Joe Pantoliano) has been killed. The authorities become increasingly convinced that he was on the take from the drugs cartels. $20m in your bank account can arouse some suspicions - though the Porsche and beautiful waterside home of \"Mike\" might have too! Anyway, our duo are having none of these scurrilous allegations and decide to investigate. \"Howard\" expected some sort of disaster, so has left the pair some breadcrumbs that lead them to suspect that there is someone close to them who is corrupt. With the body count piling up, they turn to the incarcerated \"Armando\" who thinks he may be able to identify the ringleader. That just makes him a target too - so pretty soon it's a nimble, deadly and quite grumpy triumvirate who are on the trail of the murderers. From now on we have a standard and predicable action adventure with loads of lively pyrotechnics, car stunts and an hungry albino crocodile to accompany some quite witty repartee between the two men who are clearly very much at ease in each other's company. There's a bit of eye candy from Alexander Ludwig and the underused Vanessa Hudgens and the pace of the drama builds to a denouement that works well enough whilst screaming sequel at us loudly. It's nothing at all new, but is an engaging exercise in on-screen charisma and I did quite enjoy it.",

The previous installment remains the clear standout of the series comparatively speaking, though I was pleased to see this one still deliver the nessacary entertainment; it's perhaps my second favourite from the franchise. It does have flaws of course, like I'd say it's more serious than humourous and the more sincere stuff doesn't always hit as intended; especially the bits about Howard.\r\n\r\nStill, there's enough positive humour in there. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence continue to please in the lead roles, they are a great match. The rest of the cast are all decent enough, Ioan Gruffudd plays what feels like a typical Ioan Gruffudd character well. Jacob Scipio, meanwhile, is pretty solid.\r\n\r\nI will say, though, that Rhea Seehorn is underused - she's way too good for these sorta bit part roles! There are also cameo-esque appearances from Tiffany Haddish and DJ Khaled, which sounds bad on paper but, actually, both of their scenes are actually quite amusing! Away from those onscreen, camera work and editing are both pluses.\r\n\r\nDo we need a fifth <em>'Bad Boys'</em> film? No. Would I watch a fifth <em>'Bad Boys'</em> film? Yes. Yes I would.",

  "content": "I didn’t know what to expect going into the fourth installment of one of my favorite buddy cop franchises. Having seen the first movie in theaters at age 13, I grew up with this series and had my doubts about its ability to evolve. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised.\r\n\r\nThis film was a joy to watch, even though it was missing Theresa Randle, whose absence was felt. Despite this, the filmmakers managed to capture the heart and spirit that fans have come to love. The narrative remains engaging, and seeing these characters return was a real treat.\r\n\r\nThe film experimented a lot with camera techniques and visual effects. While some of these choices didn’t resonate with me, they reflect a bold attempt to refresh the series. For instance, there are several action sequences that use innovative camera angles and CGI that might feel overdone, but they also add a new layer of excitement. This experimentation is evident in a particularly intense chase scene where the dynamic camera work heightens the tension, even if it occasionally feels a bit disorienting. Definitely A LOT of Neon.\r\n\r\nOne concern I had from the trailer was the Reba McEntire joke, which seemed lame out of context. However, within the film, it actually pays off in a funny and unexpected way. This moment exemplifies how the film often exceeds expectations, taking seemingly minor elements and turning them into memorable highlights.\r\n\r\nThe heart of the film and its story align well with what fans love about the franchise. The camaraderie and banter between the leads are as sharp as ever, providing both laughs and heartfelt moments. For example, a scene where the partners reminisce about their first case together brings a touch of nostalgia while reinforcing their enduring bond.\r\n\r\nOverall, this fourth installment is a pretty good sequel that honors the legacy of its predecessors while introducing fresh elements. Despite some reservations about the new visual styles, the film’s core strengths—its characters and story—remain intact. If you are a fan of the genre and especially this franchise, you’ll likely find much to enjoy here. The film strikes a balance between innovation and familiarity, ensuring that both longtime fans and new viewers can appreciate its charms.",

  "content": "I had an absolute blast watching “Bad Boys: Ride or Die,” the fourth installment in the popular buddy comedy / action franchise that started off with a bang way back in 1995. Co-directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, back at the helm after 2020’s “Bad Boys for Life,” pay homage to the “Bad Boys” legacy while injecting new life into it. As a longtime fan, this film actually over delivers. It is everything I wanted and more. I feel like the word-of-mouth on this movie is going to be electric and if audiences decide to show up, it very well could be the movie that saves the summer box office.\r\n\r\nWhen their former Captain and friend Conrad Howard (Joe Pantoliano) is implicated in a corruption scandal involving a dangerous cartel, Miami police officers Marcus (Martin Lawrence) and Mike (Will Smith) have to work to clear his name. After a series of unexpected events, the partners find themselves on the other end of the law. Now on the run as wanted criminals (and on a hit list of local gangs), Mike and Marcus must stay ahead of the cops and the cartel while rushing to solve the mystery of who wants to frame the late Captain Howard. With danger closing in and not knowing who to trust, the men must rely on their wits, their friendship, and their street-smart instincts to survive.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot that works well here, starting with a strong story where the stakes are high, the danger feels real, and the villain is formidable. The plot, which isn’t loaded with silly twists and turns, is actually plausible. It’s a rare combination in what could’ve been just another mindless summer blockbuster, and there’s a lot more meat on the bones, narrative-wise. The film also rekindles a love for what I now consider modern iconic characters. Marcus and Mike may be older, but their banter, camaraderie, and comedic timing all still feel relevant. Most of this is due to Smith and Lawrence being a terrific pair, bickering with a natural chemistry that comes across as effortless. You believe these two guys would give their lives for each other, which makes the story even stronger. It is such a pleasure to see these two back together again.\r\n\r\nThe R-rated action is among the best of the franchise, too, from high-speed chases to intense, bloody shootouts. There are a series of inventive scenes that are expertly choreographed and storyboarded, and it’s been a while since I’ve seen such fresh and original action sequences like the ones here. The creativity sets (and hits) a higher bar, and El Arbi and Fallah’s contemporary directorial approach is stylish, energetic, and results in adrenaline-fueled action scenes that are so well done that the film is a literal heart pounder. This is one of those stand up and cheer type of films that’s best experienced with an audience that’s also fired up to be there.\r\n\r\nI absolutely loved everything about “Bad Boys: Ride or Die.” It’s the type of action film that’s done so well, you’ll leave the theater feeling that overwhelming sense of exhilaration that can only be described as a Hollywood high. If you love the genre, make it a priority to go see this one.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

I liked the AI camera effects. The psycho killer younger guys are good. Insane violence at the end. Seemed so PG until you hit the violence and there is so much celebration of violence. Maybe I missed some previous violence but it seemed quite intense and sudden.\r\n\r\nI hope they make a sequel with the psychos. Grandpas can Denzel some guys. Hopefully they'll match their speech with the rest of the graphic content. All the humour is so tame. I hear you get to say more shit when you get old. BBCU4L",

  "content": "I will not deny that I found this movie somewhat entertaining. Maybe even fairly entertaining.\r\n\r\nThis mostly comes from the action and a few entertaining humorous scenes splattered across the movie.\r\n\r\nHowever, it could have been so much better if the script had not been written by the usual bunch of low IQ Hollywood hacks.\r\n\r\nMost of the humor is just unintelligent and cringeworthy. Marcus Burnett is simply nonsensically silly most of the time. His feeding nonsense followed by this ridiculous “I am immortal” crap and rubbish dream scenes were not funny at all but rather dragged down the movie.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to create drama by making Lowrey have psychotic episodes which ruined the mission and action on several occasions was also totally unnecessary in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThe bad guy started off really good with the first scenes where the entire plot is set up. Then however, he just became your average Hollywood villain. The initial badass bad guy vibe was never developed.\r\n\r\nThe script itself is a classical Hollywood action script. That is, it is simple, very predictable, unrealistic with lots of plot holes and really just a rehash of something done a million times.\r\n\r\nHowever, in this context, it was not bad. It was certainly good enough for this type of movie.\r\n\r\nThis could have been a really good movie if the task of coming up with a script had just been given to someone with some actual talent.\r\n\r\nAs it stands this is just a somewhat (maybe even fairly) entertaining Hollywood action movie.",

  "content": "**A Villain Without Depth, A Plot Without Weight – Ride or Die Stumbles**\r\n\r\nThe title of the movie has little to do with the actual plot—a point many have noted before.The story follows Mike Lowry and Marcus Burnett, as they face major life changes. Mike finally settles down and gets married, while Marcus undergoes a temporary health crisis that shifts his outlook on life. Amidst this, a shocking revelation emerges: new evidence suggests their late former boss, Captain Howard, was corrupt and involved with Mexican drug cartels. Unsurprisingly, Mike and Marcus refuse to believe this accusation.\r\n\r\nI wasn’t excited about this movie for several reasons, one being my dislike for the previous movie. Since the directors, Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, remained the same, I didn’t expect significant improvements. The movie starts off well by avoiding a major flaw from the last one—the jarring shift between serious and comedic tones. Will Smith, despite my overall disappointment with the movie, delivered an energetic performance, and his comedic timing felt genuinely sincere.\r\n\r\nHowever, the story itself is underwhelming and below average. The premise—a beloved former police captain’s reputation being tarnished—lacks depth, and the explanation for his alleged corruption is unconvincing. The plot feels incomplete, and both the beginning and ending are mediocre, which is a significant drawback.\r\n\r\nAnother issue lies in the villains. The antagonist in this film is poorly written and unconvincing—evil simply for the sake of having a villain, rather than being a well-developed character. This weakens the movie further.\r\n\r\nUltimately, it seems the filmmakers assumed audiences would watch simply because it’s another Bad Boys movie, not because of a compelling story. The characters lack depth, the plot offers nothing new, and no fresh dimensions are added to the franchise.",

  "content": "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish had a lot to live up to as most of my critic and casual friends have been praising the film, and for the most part the film delivers.\r\n\r\nFrom the opening frames, the unique art style fills the screen and is incredibly captivating. There is some excellent combination of 3D animation with 2D styles that I have not seen before. The combat frame rate shift was also a nice touch that worked better than I was expecting. Action was top notch with some incredible set pieces and superb choreography.\r\n\r\nThe Last Wish deals with some pretty heavy themes for an animated children's movie. Death is something that all humans will have to face which was handled in such a nuanced and mature way here. From panic attacks to haunting imagery, death looms large throughout the entire film and serves as a menacing villain. The journey our heroes take to confront this fear is very heartwarming and will resonant with most audience members.\r\n\r\nWith most DreamWorks pictures, the comedy is targeted at both children and adults. I did find myself laughing out loud at plenty of jokes, but just as many landed flat for me. This would be more of an issue, but this is an incredibly balanced film with great action and dramatic moments that leave little room for a few flat jokes to make a large impact on my experience.\r\n\r\nI genuinely believe that this movie has restored the Shrek universe and can propel the future projects upward. Hype has officially been restored for Shrek 5!\r\n\r\nScore: 86%\r\nVerdict: Great",

But here we are.\r\n\r\nAfter an overly cheesy, somewhat clunky opening sequence, The Last Wish very quickly begins developing its zany assortment of characters into distinct quirky personalities with sympathetic desires and clear goals. The film juggles several character arcs and it's almost miraculous how it successfully handled all of them with proper set up and satisfying, emotionally weighty payoffs.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is wacky, witty, and also bursting with heart as it deals with weighty themes of trusting others and finding purpose in any circumstances. And it tackles these themes in ways that are always understandable to all ages but never insultingly oversimplified.\r\n\r\nWhat I also didn't expect was that the action sequences would be so well-choreographed and beautifully animated, and that the movie would often be terrifying and violent at times.\r\n\r\nI adored this film. I think it's Dreamworks' best film since Megamind and it's easily the best true family film of the year.",

His cat is a sort of combination of Cyrano de Bergerac and Casanova - full of flair, dashing and adept with his flourishing blade. Until, that is, he has a run-in with a church bell that brings him face to face with his mortality. He has only one of his nine lives left, and death is poised to come claim him! Shattered, he seeks refuge in a home for cats where he encounters \"Perrito\" - a small, naive and lost little dog who is determined to befriend him. Meantime, the not so little \"Jack Horner\" and \"Goldilocks\" and her three bears are looking for a map that will guide them to a wishing star that, well, it does what it says on the tin. The bears decide to track down our eponymous hero to help them procure it, but he and his feline rival \"Kitty\" (and their new doggy pal) decide to join forces and must face a series of tortuous escapades in the race to succeed in their quest. It must be 45 years since I last read the \"Goldilocks\" story and try as I might, I just couldn't remember it as it gradually evolves as one of the threads of this enjoyably crafted montage of fable and charisma. It's pretty action packed with Banderas proving his singing hasn't really improved much since \"Evita\" (1996). It's a family movie for sure with messages of loyalty, affection, determination etc.; but there is still enough in the dialogue for those older folks in the auditorium to raise a smile and keep it interesting for 100 minutes. The animation is super and this character driven adventure is well worth seeing on a big screen if you can. Maybe not one for tiny kids - but for us bigger ones, this is fun.",

I had heard murmurs of hype about it so was expecting it to be very good, yet it still managed to surpass my expectations. It features a great story with well utilised characters, of which there are quite a few.\r\n\r\nSoon after hitting play I wasn't actually sure about the animation, for one Puss himself looked different to how I remember him from <em>'Shrek'</em>. However, those thoughts quickly disappeared because the style is, in fact, gorgeous. You can tell the people making this had heart in it, rather than just milking the IP for another installment.\r\n\r\nAntonio Banderas remains a joy as Puss in Boots, a character that wouldn't be as memorable without him. Harvey Guillén comes in with a standout showing, I do think Perrito is the least interesting visually but the character (and voice) is what makes the dog a successful addition. John Mulaney (thought it was Zach Braff, ngl) is a positive newbie too.\r\n\r\nFlorence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone and Samson Kayo are also pluses, as are Salma Hayek and Wagner Moura. Evidently, it's a quality cast. A minor shame we didn't get anyone big back from the original series, though I do approve with how this one concludes in that regard.",

  "content": "Few will likely take issue with the notion that “Crime doesn’t pay.” And that idea rings even more true if restated as “Crime doesn’t pay if you’re a nice guy.” That’s one of the truths that emerges loud and clear in this fact-based comedy-drama about soldier-turned-thief Jeffrey Manchester (Channing Tatum), who had trouble finding his way (and making ends meet) after leaving the military. Set in North Carolina in 2004, this young husband and father is greatly troubled by his inability to adequately provide for his family. His solution is to turn to a life of crime, specifically drawing on his uncanny knack for being able to spot details in opportunities and exploit them to his advantage. He specifically targets fast food restaurants, gaining access by breaking through the roofs of these businesses and dropping in to swipe whatever cash is on hand, generally just before they open for the day. He treats the skeleton crews typically on duty at that time with his signature polite, apologetic courtesy and kindness before stealthily making off with the loot. His stash adds up quickly and substantially – that is, until one time when he’s caught, convicted and thrown into prison. But that proves to be a mere detour, promptly escaping and going on the run, skillfully taking refuge behind the scenes in a Toys ‘R’ Us store. However, his stay turns out to be longer than anticipated, and, with that kind of time on his hands and a natural inclination to want to be helpful to others in need, he unwittingly becomes distracted. This leaves him vulnerable to being discovered and recaptured, especially when his Samaritan side surfaces in doing right by others. That’s especially true when he takes a liking to Leigh Wainscott (Kirsten Dunst), a genial but challenged single mother of two who works at the store and who falls hard for his charms, unaware of who he really is. Can Jeffrey keep up the ruse? Or will he fall victim to his naturally compassionate and generous tendencies? As endearing as this crowd-pleasing story might sound, though, it’s somewhat uneven (and at times innocuous) in its execution. For instance, it’s difficult to fathom how someone so allegedly nice could simultaneously be capable of such dubious behavior (especially when viewers never really get to find out how he got that way). Then there’s the film’s tendency to downplay the seriousness of the protagonist’s actions in light of the picture’s predominantly frothy narrative. And the love interest story thread – no matter how charming it might be at times – is given too much weight in the overall flow of the movie. With that said, though, there are definite strengths present here, too, particularly in this offering’s depiction of a hardened criminal hiding out in the whimsical environment of a toy store, the aspect of the film that truly works best (and should have received greater focus). The wacky juxtaposition of these disparate elements evokes many hearty laughs, especially in the segments where the protagonist must inventively look for ways to keep from being found out, most notably by the facility’s surly store manager, Mitch (Peter Dinklage). In all, though, while “Roofman” makes for a modestly entertaining diversion, it would have fared better by playing to its strengths more and scaling back the less engaging romantic subplot, sequences that tend to slow the pacing and detract from what actually works best. Indeed, try as writer-director Derek Cianfrance might, there’s simply no getting away with that.",

Stephen King's _It_ is one of my all time favourite books, and I don't know that it will ever get a faithful adaptation (totally understandable seeing as the thing is 1200 pages and contains a multi-book spanning mythology of Space Gods and Turtle vomit), but this does a pretty good job of interpreting the feeling of the novel, even if it's not a great adaptation the events as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe kids are all great, Skarsgård makes for a good Pennywise, Pennywise improves as the piece moves forward, and the town is completely believable as \"Derry\" in the '80s. It may not be all it's purported to be, but is a very impressive film on its own merits.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._",

  "content": "Something certainly rings true in the horror thriller **It** that capitalizes on that common known fear that clowns are creepy annoyances to those that have an intense phobia towards them. In the case of **It’s** dastardly powder-faced joyboy or shall we say corrosive killjoy Pennywise the Dancing Clown, he definitely takes the cake in terms of his treacherous tendencies to quiet the unsuspecting kiddies in devious fashion. Here is a tip, parents, do not invite the poisonous Pennywise to your kids’ birthday party any time soon to blow up balloons and sing songs. This is just a friendly little warning. There is more to elaborate on regarding the sicko circus funnypants freak later.\r\n\r\nDirector Andy Muschietti (‘Mama’) delves into this surprisingly delicious twisted and terrorizing tale of a killer clown that gets his jollies off snuffing the lives out of rural-based youngsters in this calculating frightfest that pushes all the right buttons of panic and perversion. Skilfully edgy and traumatically tasty, **It** is a refreshing throwback to old-fashioned gory-minded gems where the boundaries of old-fashioned scare tactics were designed not only by the actual act of homicidal happenings but the mere suggestive nature of the heinous hedonism taking place. Polished and gripping in its shadowy and shifty overtones, **It** is convincingly probing as an absorbing psychological character study with an off-kilter sense of defiance in its naughty commentary on youthful innocence being compromised.\r\n\r\nBased on the novel from famed hair-raising author Stephen King, **It** delivers the solid, sordid goods of a wild and wicked imagination following the acidic exploits of a menacing clown in the aforementioned Pennywise (played with penetrating  and devilish aplomb by Bill Skarsgard from ‘Atomic Blonde’) whose murderous methods of slaughtering the young has been a staple signature in his madness for centuries now. The surviving tykes in the quaint town of Derry, Maine must now safeguard themselves from the makeup-wearing whackjob and figure out a way to terminate the baggy-panted beast before he continues to strike again and victimize another doomed child.\r\n\r\nThe backstory behind Pennywise’s existence is that he is some shape-shifting demon that emerges from the sewers only to target the unlucky rugrat in his immediate path while conniving, and conducting his blood-thirsty ways. However, there are a group of children that refuse to play dead for the demented clown and the quest to create an ill-advised showdown with the deplorable Pennywise would prove to be a very violent and mentally scarring experience in the process.\r\n\r\nThe story centres around young Bill (Jaeden Lieberher, ‘Allegiant’) and his early encounter with the sadness of unknowingly witnessing Pennywise’s wrath as it was inferred that the clown had to do with the demise of his precious little brother, George (Jackson Robert Scott), who never returned after enthusiastically wanting to work on a fun project in the basement. This haunting revelation sticks with poor Bill until this very day.\r\n\r\nNowadays, Bill must cope with the typical obstacles at school avoiding bullies and dealing with the pitfalls of peer pressure and needing to belong to a group of trusty associates. Thus, Bill is able to cement close relationships with the town’s other free-spirited youngsters. Still, there is that hovering myth about the mysterious sewers and, yes, the evil-minded Pennywise is at the forefront of fearful concern for Bill and the bunch. In fact, the gang will succumb to their collection of fears, paranoia and hesitation as the suburban legend of the creep-seeking clown clouds each of the kids’ tainted psyches.\r\n\r\nThe ensemble of young actors in **It**  all register accordingly with their characters’ childhood shock in trying to overcome the overwhelming and petrifying mindset that has invaded their sensibilities. Lieberher has an authentic raw turn as the lead lad invested in the bizarre boundaries of matching wits with the demonic chalk-skinned trickster and his committed craziness. The other supporting cast of exposed kiddies on this adventurous train wreck of terror includes Sophia Lillis (’37’), Finn Wolfhard (from television’s ‘Stranger Things’), Jeremy Ray Taylor (‘Alvin And The Chipmunks: The Road Chip’), Wyatt Oleff (‘Guardians Of The Galaxy”), Chosen Jacobs, Jack Dylan Grazer (‘Tales Of Halloween’) and Nicholas Hamilton (‘Captain Fantastic’).\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that Skarsgard’s clown of corrosion in Pennywise steals the show with his nefarious nature blistering shamelessly in seedy-minded elation. Clearly, Skarsgard chews the tarnished scenery with his abominable costumed cretin tip toeing on the unassuming sidelines while striking gory goosebump moments for his pubescent prey on screen and the twitchy audience off screen.\r\n\r\nSure, **It** suffers from the conventional trappings of cheesy false alarm jolts and the obligatory lurking in the dark sequences are arbitrarily tossed in as an aftermath for the legitimate lunacy of our star-making crazed and corruptible clown to perform his showboating insanity. Besides, what horror showcase has not welcomed the invitation of the overused and abused jump-scare techniques highlighted by a jittery soundtrack? Still, Muschietti and screenwriters Chase Palmer, Cary Joji Funkunga and Gary Dauberman manage to supply the infectious and insidious **It** with well-executed scary shenanigans, well-paced anxiety, wavering vulnerability and decent acting on behalf of the performers that aptly brought to life the eerie visions and vitality of King’s complex, creative mind.\r\n\r\nTruly **It** is one of the best harrowing and in-depth horror/psychological thrillers to emerge in 2017. Also this titillating tale of cautionary kiddie chaos may be one of King’s formidable movie adaptions since the effective tension-filled, off-the-wall brilliance of 1990’s _Misery_.    \r\n\r\n**It** (2017)\r\n\r\nWarner Bros.

  "content": "It is a movie that looked interesting, but I wasn't necessarily anticipating, because it had the potential to be awful. After seeing it, I can say that while it is good, I don't think it's nearly as good as other people are saying it is, and it had the potential to be. Starting off with the good, the film has some fantastic performances from the kids. I think the best performances in the film are from Andy Skaarsgard (or however you spell it) for Pennywise, and the kid who had asthma. I don't know his name, and I haven't seen him in anything before, but he stole the show. The movie also has some pretty scary moments. The scene inside of the house is one of the scariest scenes of the year, and there are lost of images that were genuinely disturbing. While the films was full of cheesy dialogue, the conversations between the kids are extremely entertaining and captivating. When it came to characters, MOST of the characters are well done and fleshed out. And that leads me to one of the 4 things that keep this film from being great in my eyes. Some characters, such as the bullies and Stan, and bland and have no back story. Therefore, whenever they are put in danger, it isn't nearly as scary as with other characters. Another reason I didn't love this film is the rock fight scene. Basically, the Losers Club stumbles upon the bullies and they throw rocks at each other. The rocks seemingly bounce off of their head without any problems like a trampoline. No one gets killed, or even knocked out. Overall, it was a very bad scene. For the most part the special effects were pretty good. However, the leper outside of the creepy house was awful. The costume would be great if it were for a haunted house or prank, but not for a big budgeted horror movie. When it came on screen I literally thought it was a bully playing tricks on him. And the last problem I have with the film is that the police are seemingly nowhere, along with parents. *Mild spoilers* One of the bullies murders his dad, a police officer, and then around a few scenes later, the son dies too. The bullies like to go around thereatening kids with knives and carving H's into their bellies. I think we would see at least one police officer investegating something in the film, and if not, I think my parents would notice if one day I came home and there was a gigantic blood pool on my shirt. Overall, It is a very fun movie. There are certainly better movies out there, but with this, I have an urge to go watch it again in theaters. It is a perfectly fun popcorn flick.\r\n\r\nScore: 7.5/10",

  "content": "Every 27 years, the town of Derry experiences sudden, violent and inexplicable mayhem. In 1989, a group of school children rather unkindly called \"The Losers Club\" decide it is for them to investigate just what has happened. Led by \"Bill\" (Jaeden Martell) whose younger brother was a victim, these brave kids are soon on the trail of the shapeshifting \"Pennywise\" - a being from another dimension who frequently takes the shape of a clown. Question is - are these youngsters any match for this lethal and despicable foe? Andy Muschietti has done well here with this film. He manages to combine the more traditional spookiness of the old dark house, with a group of likeable characters who demonstrate the benefits of trust and teamwork as they take on this evil. As with most good horror films, the seemingly invincible must have a weakness, otherwise the plot becomes unsustainable - and this one allows the youngsters to define and exploit this whilst still maintaining enough shock moments and sense of menace to keep the thing interesting. The dialogue isn't the best, but that is not so important here - it's still a really well paced and genuinely scary story that engenders fear from something so outwardly benign as a clown - normally the symbol of joy and happiness. I rarely jump at the cinema nowadays, but this does work!",

Unfortunately, not everyone managed to escape from the collapsing dome and poor old \"Peeta\" is being used, shamelessly, by the authorities to try and paint \"Katniss\" as the epitome of revolution and evil and so the scene is set: rescue him and mass their forces for an attack that will eliminate the totalitarian regime once and for all. Aside from one of two combat scenes, very little actually happens here. There is a great deal of dialogue, plenty of moralising and if I'm honest, \"Coin\" doesn't come across as any more trustworthy than the man she hopes to succeed. There simply isn't enough by way of plot to sustain this for two hours and the acting still, largely, refuses to engage me. Liam Hemsworth (\"Gale\") features a little more, but the confused does she/doesn't she romance stuff is exasperating as this supposedly emotionally and sexually charged environment delivers nothing by way of passion - indeed the pace of the whole thing borders on the racial. Sure, it looks great but I feel that the writing is very much on the wall for part two - my expectations are pretty low.",

  "content": "Carpe Diem & The Punk Rock Movie.\r\n\r\nDead Poets Society is directed by Peter Weir (Picnic At Hanging Rock/Gallipoli) and stars Robin Williams, Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke, Kurtwood Smith, Gale Hansen & Norman Lloyd. The script is written by Tom Schulman, based on his life at Montgomery Bell Academy, an all-boys preparatory school in Nashville, Tennessee. The film is set in 1959 at the fictional Welton Academy in Vermont (location shoot from St. Andrew's School in Middletown, Delaware). The story follows that of English teacher John Keating who uses his different method of teaching to inspire his students to be all that they can be whilst warning of the perils of conformity.\r\n\r\nDead Poets Society was a monster smash hit that made almost $220 million profit in Worldwide box office takings. Not bad considering this was the year that film lovers flocked to see the likes of Batman, Lethal Weapon 2 and the third outing for one Indiana Jones. It showed that there was a mainstream market for serious drama if it is done well. And rest assured, Dead Poets Society is done well, very well in fact. Its launchpad is Schulman's Academy Award winning script that puts under the microscope educational conformity and the ogres that are parental and peer pressure. Enter the inspired casting of Robin Wiliams (nominated for BAFTA & Academy Award for Best Actor) as the teacher who urges his charges to see outside of the box that they have been placed in. Young men, soon to be full adults, who have their lives mapped out for them, are challenged by Mr Keating to be spontaneous, to pursue idealism and view life with new perspectives.\r\n\r\nComing two years after he was nominated for Good Morning Vietnam, Williams once and for all proves to his doubters that he is a quality dramatic actor. His Keating is charismatic but without the mad-cap histrionics that Williams is famed for. Very controlled, in that what is in essence a catalyst role, Keating hasn't rushed to become said catalyst. He's a constant sympathetic presence, a father figure type, yet a confidential friend too. That Schulman's script has avoided the usual clichés that come with teacher-student relations in film's helps Williams as an actor to breath intelligent life into Keating. Even the flecks of humour that Williams is allowed to work from, such as Brando doing Shakespeare, play with a warmth that's essential to the relationships forming in the piece. Tho it's unquestionably Williams' movie (the film soars when he is on screen), the young cast playing the students get an A + for their sensitive portrayals. Notably Robert Sean Leonard (heartfelt), Ethan Hawke (haunting) & Gale Hansen (punky). While Kurtwood Smith leaves an indelible image as a domineering father.\r\n\r\nIn the hands of Weir, the film, unsurprisingly to his fans, carries an air of mysticism too. Again working with one of his regular DOP's, John Seale, Weir knows how to capture the time, place and people in his movies; while cloaking them in dashes of mystical beauty. Be it the boys striding around the school grounds amidst autumnal hues, or plodding wearily thru the snowy terrain as Winter kicks in, Weir gives the scenes an apt poetic quality. It's also of note that these scenes, as well as the cave sequences where the Dead Poets Society meetings take place, blend with the characters emotional states. Sprightly and optimistic around the greenery, nervous and excited in the darkened cave, then heavy of heart and leg as the fall accompanies the emotionally turbulent last quarter. A last quarter that leads to what has now become a divisive ending. Some have (and will) come away from it irked and claiming it to be syrupy. Others such as myself find it uplifting, hopeful and a fitting end to the emotional roller-coaster that cast and crew have taken us on. Is your glass half full or half empty? An excellent and intelligent story is directed and acted accordingly, with its themes making it actually one of the best Punk Rock movies out there. 9/10",

  "content": "_**Seize the day; be Exceptional!**_\r\n\r\nJohn Keating (Robin Williams), a new teacher at a stuffy prep school in 1959, inspires his students to capitalize on their natural talents and develop a passion for life because they only have one shot and in 60 years or so they'll all be worm-food. Each boy starts to act on Keating's dynamic ideas with explosive consequences , both good and bad.\r\n\r\nReleased in 1989 and directed by Peter Weir, \"Dead Poets Society\" is a coming-of-age drama that's one of the most inspiring films ever made and ranks with my all-time favorite movies. The film captivates from the very beginning and doesn't release until it's over. That's when you KNOW a movie's really good, regardless of the subject matter. The cinematography and locations are top rate, shot in the Middletown region of Delaware (although the story itself takes place in Vermont). The quiet Fall & Winter scenes are breathtaking.\r\n\r\nThis is not a spoiler, but there's a powerful scene at the climax where the students give Keating a daring final salute. Roger Ebert criticized the scene as \"so moving he wanted to throw up,\" but he's dead wrong. It is both unexpected and potent.\r\n\r\nThe film contains a wealth of riches to mine in subsequent viewings, and I don't just mean the insights conjured from the poetry & prose. Here are a handful off the top of my head: \"The letter kills,\" referring to the legalistic nature of Neil's joyless father and most of the teachers at the school; the type of Judas (Cameron); the scapegoat (Keating); the stunning nature of feminine beauty (when Chris appears at the entrance of the school and the guys' mouths drop); the marvels of nature and how they're conducive to inspiration & spirituality; Keating's heartbroken countenance after Neil is removed from the theater crowd (Keating knows there's little he can do about the authoritarian mistreatment).\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of insignificant scenes that don't work so well, but that's always the case, even with the best of films.\r\n\r\nOne possible objection is that one boy's tragedy goes against the very message of the film to \"seize the day.\" I disagree. The kid really started to \"seize the day\" but his passions were quenched by someone who didn't share Keating's mindset and he unfortunately couldn't handle it. Again, dynamic ideas have explosive consequences, good and bad. The other kids had varying results with their attempts to \"seize the day.\" Some made progress in attaining their dreams and others got in trouble because they threw wisdom to the wind. The varying results make the story realistic.\r\n\r\nAnother criticism was voiced by a reviewer who stated that the late night meetings at the cave to read poetry and inspire one another were \"homo erotic.\" This interpretation could only be derived by an adult in our gay-obsessed modern culture. The kids in the film are about 16-17 years-old. This was the only way they could go out and have fun under the strict rules of a New England prep school in 1959. I remember when I was a teenager going out to the treehouse with several guys and drinking & smoking; we'd sometimes discuss metal/rock lyrics, which could be viewed as a delinquent form of poetry, and other such things. Sometimes we'd bring a girl or three. Likewise, in two of the cave meetings in the film one of the guys brings a couple babes from another school whilst the others look on in awe; on two other occasions a guy brings nude pages of whoa-men. I think that pretty much quells the \"homo-erotic\" theory.\r\n\r\nMost of those who scoff at this film's message go back to their 9 to 5 slavery (or 3 to 11 or 11 to 7, etc.) with no light at the end of the mundane tunnel. I encourage such people to give the film a second look. But BEWARE, there are no moronic explosions, CGI, non-stop 'action,' gore, OTT cussing, nudity or sex scenes; I know that's completely shocking, but it's true. Then I would encourage these people to take a good look at their lives and ask: Are you willing to change it? Throw off the shackles? Throw caution to the wind and pursue your true calling, your dream? Will you \"sieze the day\"? Or will you continue to stagnate in a puddle of mediocrity? The answer that comes back will usually determine if this film becomes a favorite or not.\r\n\r\nFINAL ANALYSIS: Australian director Peter Weir has other good films like \"Witness\" and \"Picnic at Hanging Rock\" (the latter is, incidentally, a film about an ALL-GIRLS school and can be boring if you're not in the mood for an ultra-mystery yarn), but \"Dead Poets Society\" is his best. Check it out. Give it a second (or third) chance if you haven't already. It's an outstanding story and it'll inspire you, especially if you've fallen into a life-stifling, growth-stultifying rut of drudgery.\r\n\r\nThe film runs just over two hours (128 minutes).\r\n\r\nGRADE: A+",

As you'd expect, they weren't particularly interested, but when he begins by telling them to rip up the poetry manual, and continues with an inspirational and vocational approach the pupils start to engage not only with him, but they set up the eponymous club which helps each of them to develop as a person. This is quite a task for the shy young \"Todd\" (easily the most effective performance of Ethan Hawke's career) and for aspiring actor \"Neil\" (a terrifically measured and sincere Robert Sean Leonard) who is struggling to reconcile his own desires with those of his loving, but over-bearing, father who wants him to go to Harvard and become a lawyer. This is a terrific character based drama with Williams on great form, but he features quite sparingly - the thrust of this potent, funny and thought-provoking narrative rests with the young men. Their ensemble effort exposes a myriad of layered teenage foibles from trauma to Tennyson; Shakespeare to sex (or sax!) - with well written and delivered dialogue that focuses poignantly and cleverly on their maturing personalities. This film is highly recommended.",

However, this film isn't content to end on such a desperately dispiriting note as Neil's tragic suicide, so it returns to the original stance championed by Keating throughout when some of his now former students stand on their desktops in an act of defiant solidarity and also as a final salute to their departing captain. They now have the potential to see life from a completely different angle than the rest of us because of him and that is precisely what a solid education is supposed to do. It is the precious gift of being able to think and reason and draw intelligent and well informed conclusions for yourself on any number of various subjects.",

  "content": "The young \"Furiosa\" (Alyla Browne) is captured by some rogue bikers and despite the best efforts of her sharp-shooting mother is help captive by the menacing \"Dementus\" (Chris Hemsworth) who rather paternally calls her \"Little D\"! This dystopian world really consists of three powers. The \"Immortan Joe\" (Lachy Hulme) in an unassailable citadel where food and water are plentiful, the \"Guardian of Gastown\" (Peter Stephens) who runs the last refinery producing petrol and the \"Bullet Farm\" - a quarry. They have a loose bartering arrangement that allows each to hold their own territory and this is arrangement \"Dementus\" and his army of thousands wants to take control of. He does manage to secure a better deal with \"Joe\" but only if he trades his \"Little D\" as part of the bargain. Once she's been duly swapped and introduced to his harem, she determines that she needs a new ID! Years go by as she passes for a boy, moves up the food chain at the Citadel and is finally sent on war-rig duties trading gas for food. It's now that she (Anya Taylor-Joy) encounters the war-rig driver \"Praeteorian Jack\" (Tom Burke) and, thinking he might be a conduit for her to get back home, joins forces for some battles royal. As origin stories go, this is good end to end stuff, quickly paced and packed with action right from the beginning. Hemsworth is highly entertaining as the prose-spouting monster and there are loads of supporting characters - the likes of \"Smeg\", \"Rictus Erectus\" and \"Scrotus\" to characterise these gangs of violent and ruthless half-wits. ATJ doesn't really have that much to do for most of this, and has virtually no dialogue - but when she is on screen she works well with her ninja skills coming to the fore. I didn't love the ending, it drags a bit and is entirely predictable, but this holds up well for 2½ hours and the stunt work and live-action photography is impressive.",

That's where this film was always going to fall flat with viewing audiences.\r\n\r\nIf this film had been about Mad Max with a back story covering as yet unrevealed aspects of the life of  the younger and older Max, in the latter case played by the actor who made the franchise famous, Mel Gibson, then I suspect Hollywood would have a real HIT on their hands. \r\n\r\nIn summary, you don't make a major film about the back story of a peripheral character from a franchise, you make the film about the MAIN character, its as simple as that.

With that said, I still got the desired amount of entertainment from this 2024 flick. Chris Hemsworth is outstanding, easily the most I've wanted to see a character onscreen from this series; he fits the role perfectly.\r\n\r\nAnya Taylor-Joy puts in a very good showing as well, her character doesn't say much so a lot of the performance is reliant on her visual emotions - which Taylor-Joy portrays on point. The rest of the cast are on the same level to me, all support the show well without rising near the lead two; similar-ish story for the whole franchise, in truth.\r\n\r\nVisually the movie looks cracking, while the action matches prior installments in providing the vast majority of what makes these films so worth the watch. This prequel/spin-off is one I'd put in the top bracket from this series, it's up there with <em>'Mad Max: Fury Road'</em> - which does just slightly edge ahead.",

At 2h20m it definitely made me feel my sleepy age (I saw it on my 39th birthday, and I was squinting and yawning by the end!) but I felt more impressed that a relatively slow paced film gripped me for so long.\r\n\r\nIt's a proper odyssey, with poor Furiosa only wanting to get home; but the trials she faces grow organically out of the plot and the universe, and give Furiosa a depth I didn't expect from a character/actor who's almost entirely expressionless through the film.\r\n\r\nThis entry in the Mad Max continuum (though I've only watched [the first](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/9659-mad-max), and [Fury Road](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/76341-mad-max-fury-road)) steers away from exploring the whats and whys of the apocalyptic world they live in, tempting though I'm sure it was in a 2024 that has _so many_ parallels, and instead lets us draw our own conclusions. The men in power who lie and rabble-rouse to get the power they desire, just so they can watch the world burn (again); how much we all embrace making ourselves vulnerable for the hope of human connection; the power dynamics and game theory in a world where two thirds of what you need is only necessary because of collective attitudes.\r\n\r\nI'm certain I'll watch this again—and as a stand-alone film—which, for a long and relatively simple plot, is something very uncommon for me.

  "content": "This installment of the Mad Max saga was disappointing. Personally, I would have preferred a continuation of Furiosa's story with Charlize Theron rather than an origin story. However, once Anya Taylor-Joy was cast, my excitement returned. Her performance in The Menu is one of my favorites, and she has never given a bad performance. Despite my anticipation, I walked out of this movie feeling underwhelmed.\r\n\r\nThe film feels a bit detached from the franchise. Returning to an origin story, especially in this series, feels like a misstep. The strength of the first four movies lies in their forward momentum and the development of their characters. We've already seen the beginning in Mad Max; what the audience craves is progress, ideally with Max at the forefront but I would like to see 'Furiosa' along for future rides.\r\n\r\nWhile the cinematography is undeniably gorgeous, the editing leaves much to be desired. The film spends too much time on areas that don't align with what makes a Mad Max film great. For example, the original films excelled in their high-octane action sequences and tight pacing, whereas this installment meanders, losing the kinetic energy that defines the series and limits an entire war to a montage.\r\n\r\nChris Hemsworth's portrayal of Dementus is a mixed bag. He brings a certain fun to the role, but his character often feels frustratingly inconsistent. There are moments where Dementus' choices seem out of character or simply don’t make sense, disrupting the narrative flow and diminishing the overall impact of the film. Some could argue that his demented nature is the reason for his decisions but even that idea falls flat.\r\n\r\nOne of the most disappointing aspects is that this movie lacks the fun, rewatchable quality of its predecessors. The previous films in the series are known for their relentless pace and compelling characters, making them enjoyable to revisit. This installment, however, doesn’t capture that same magic, leaving it feeling somewhat deflated in comparison.\r\n\r\nWhile 'Furiosa' offers some stunning visals and strong performances, it ultimately fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessors. The decision to focus on an origin story rather than continuing Furiosa's journey feels like a missed opportunity. Fans of the franchise may find some enjoyment in the film, but it doesn’t possess the same exhilarating spirit that made the earlier movies iconic.\r\n\r\nMoving forward, it would be more satisfying to see the series return to its roots, focusing on character-driven narratives that push the story forward. A continuation of Furiosa’s journey or a new chapter with Max would likely resonate more with audiences, capturing the essence of what makes Mad Max an enduring and beloved franchise.",

  "content": "There’s no doubt that “Furiosa” is a strong, entertaining, and high quality film, but director George Miller‘s latest installment in the Mad Max franchise falls short in delivering the same fresh and original experience as “Fury Road.” Miller builds on the legacy of the 2015 Oscar-winning hit, but the film still struggles with a repetitive narrative (and a tired retread of visuals) that fails to capture the groundbreaking innovations that made its predecessor such a worldwide phenomenon. I liked this movie a lot, but I certainly didn’t love it.\r\n\r\nAs the world collapses, young Furiosa (Alyla Browne) is forcibly taken from the Green Place of Many Mothers and captured by a formidable Biker Horde led by the Warlord Dementus (Chris Hemsworth). As they traverse the Wasteland, they encounter the Citadel, ruled by Immortan Joe (Lachy Hulme). Amidst the power struggle between these two tyrants, Furiosa (Anya Taylor-Joy) must endure numerous trials to gather the resources needed to find her way back home.\r\n\r\nThe film tells the origin story of the renegade warrior (and certified badass) Furiosa before her encounter with Mad Max. It’s a prequel to “Fury Road,” and this movie builds a satisfying history to the unlikely female hero. The first half of the story is the most compelling, as the narrative traces Furiosa’s journey from a young girl held captive in a brutal world to her development into a fierce combatant. The first part of her history is also filled with the most emotional depth, outlining the motivations of her character and the harsh realities that shaped her. It adds layers of complexity to the character, which is why I found this part of the movie to be the most engaging.\r\n\r\nThe second half began to wear me down as it falls into a repetitive cycle of desert chases and action scenes that feel all too familiar. While they’re executed with Miller’s signature flair, they seem lacking in innovation. The whole “been there, done that” vibe really puts a damper on things. I think part of the problem here is that “Fury Road” set such a high bar with its inventive visual style and storytelling, and a lot of that is replicated (flaming fireballs, armored trucks, vast expanses of golden deserts…even some of the exact same stunts are in play). This makes the film too predictable and slightly disappointing, especially when that element of surprise and eye-popping awe has come to define the franchise. The action is a blast and the post-apocalyptic setting and costumes are exceptional, but the envelope isn’t quite pushed as far as it could’ve been.\r\n\r\nThe brightest spot is, without question, Simon Duggan‘s cinematography. This is a gorgeous looking movie from beginning to end, and the visuals capture the brutality as well as the stark beauty of the wasteland. The special effects are also flawless, but all of these technical achievements (and strong performances from the cast) can’t quite compensate for the weaker elements — although I would venture to guess that diehard fans aren’t going to care.\r\n\r\n“Furiosa” is a worthy addition to the Mad Max saga, even if it doesn’t reach the creative heights nor deliver the groundbreaking experience that delighted all of us with “Fury Road.”\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",

  "content": "<em>'Nosferatu'</em> didn't quite hook me, but there is enough about it that I can consider it as a good film. The visuals are splendid, as are the gothic horror elements. On the cast, Lily-Rose Depp impresses, as does (more minimally) Emma Corrin and I'm always happy to see Willem Dafoe.\r\n\r\nI do continue to feel quite nonplussed by Nicholas Hoult. I did like him in fellow 2024 release <em>'Juror #2'</em>, but in this I've kinda reverted to feeling unmoved by him onscreen. I'm not entirely sure why as he seems a likeable chap, yet his performances just don't really register - which admittedly sounds harsher than I intended.\r\n\r\nBill Skarsgård as Count Orlok is also a part of this flick that I'm unsure on. Does he look the real deal? Absolutely, no complaints there, but I particularly found the dialogue with him to be a borderline bumbling mess. I found the scenes directly with Count to be the least interesting.\r\n\r\nI would also say that the movie goes on for a bit too long, though I admit that probably is more of a personal shout than one that is to be set in stone; because if you love this, it'll be the perfect length I'm sure. For me, I feel like they went around the houses a tad. With that said, I did highly enjoy that final scene with Depp - very good!\r\n\r\nThose last paragraphs make it sound like I have a dislike for this film. I do not. It just has some noteworthy points that I felt the need to mention. As I type, having not looked at how this has been received, I'd be shocked if this wasn't rated high. Either way, this is worth a watch.\r\n\r\nThis is my third Robert Eggers film. I loved <em>'The Northman'</em> (9/10) but I, honestly, hated <em>'The Lighthouse'</em> (4/10). Safe to say this falls exactly down the middle, in terms of how I think of it. Quite a stark contrast even so, kinda fascinated to see how <em>'The Witch'</em> hits me when I get around to that at some point.",

  "content": "\"Tom\" (Nicholas Hoult) is lovingly married to \"Ellen\" (Lily-Rose Depp) but they haven't much money. That could change, though, as his boss \"Knock\" (Simon McBurney) charges him with a very special mission. He must travel from his German home to the mountains of Carpathia where he must facilitate the sale of a ruined manor house to the reclusive \"Count Orlok\" (Bill Skarsgård). His journey is riddled with portents of suspicion and doom; those he encounters warm him to turn back - but on he goes until he arrives at the castle and is greeted by his enigmatic host. What he thinks is the contract to seal the deal on the house is anything but, as he is soon tormented in his dreams. Many hundreds of miles away, his wife is also suffering - and that causes his best friend \"Friedrich\" (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) to call in \"Dr. Sievers\" (Ralph Ineson) who in turn looks to the scientifically ostracised \"Prof. von Franz\" (Willem Dafoe) for some answers. There are no tangible causes, and the professor quickly concludes that it is evil that's at work and that the continuing and inexplicable absence of her husband, his employer and a recently arrived plague of rats are all part of the supernatural causes of her melancholy. There might be a solution, but that requires an act of supreme sacrifice on the part of the young \"Ellen\", or can her husband and his friends find another way? I'm not really a fan of two-parters, but I think in this case that might have been a better solution for Robert Eggers. We have a brief historical introduction to the Count and to the underlying cause of all of the troubles for \"Ellen\" but for the first hour of the film we don't really develop the characters enough, nor sow the seeds for the mysticism especially well. He relies too heavily on our knowledge of the Galeen story of \"Nosferatu\" (as opposed to the Bram Stoker \"Dracula\" one). I could have done with more depth to that chronology. Once \"Orlok\" is on his voyage and afterwards in the town where his merciless behaviour causes misery and panic, we seem to hit the accelerator and rush to the conclusion as if the cock really were about to crow any minute. There simply isn't time to allow the menace to accumulate. Though the visuals are impressively bleak, most of the acting is remarkably bland. Hoult manages to exude some decent terror now and again, but ATJ is really wooden; it takes too long for Depp to show us what she can bring to this under-exposed character and we just don't see anywhere near enough of the ghoulish \"Orlok\" to understand what this story is essentially all about. It's a gothic, dark, gloomy love story. A story of deceit and betrayal and I wanted more. I wanted to feel a little more invested in the characters: to sympathise, to pity, to fear, even. Perhaps a director's cut is in the offing? It's a great watch on a big screen, but I have to admit to being just a little disappointed.",

  "content": "\"Nosferatu\" tries far too hard to be something, it could more readily have been, with a lighter touch.  \r\n\r\nYou can see what they are going for, a creepy noir, horror fantasy. The problem is, it feels obsessively over stylised, to the point of leaden Gothic oppressiveness. Its a quality that infects the characterisations, as well. They feel over stated, too much larger than life (or is that death) and as a a result, at times, farcical. \r\n\r\nThe story itself, to those who have read Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\", is mostly familiar.  A few amendments have been made to bring it more in line with the original  \"Nosferatu\" directed by F. W. Murnau, way back in 1922. Count Dracula has been replaced by Count Orlock, for example. I did feel the ending (which also departs from the novel) was a \"bit thin\" and somewhat underwhelming.\r\n\r\nI will say, in spite of its limitations, I don't hate this film. Its clear a lot of effort and care has been invested into its creation. I think too, certain dramatic and visual aspects of the Gothic film noir approach, are creepily memorable. \r\n\r\nIn summary, \"Nosferatu\" is a valiant effort that would have been markedly better with gentler handling. A balance of the dark aspects of the film with a more subtle, lighter approach would have led to a superior final product. \r\n\r\nUltimately a rather emotionally and visually, cumbersome watch, you might want to spread over a couple of evenings.",

  "content": "Nosferatu (2024) marks the third remake of the original 1922 film, and at this point, you have to wonder, how many times do we need to see this story retold? It’s also part of a ridiculously long list of Dracula-related films, with nearly 95 adaptations floating around. While this version brings fresh cinematography and a chilling atmosphere, it doesn’t reinvent the story in any significant way. The plot follows the familiar beats of Count Orlok’s eerie presence and growing obsession, but it takes its time getting anywhere. The directing leans heavily into gothic horror, which works for setting the mood, but sometimes it feels more focused on aesthetics than storytelling.\r\n\r\nVisually, the film is stunning. The cinematography is easily its strongest aspect, with haunting lighting, deep shadows, and eerie textures that create a cold, unsettling world. The acting is another highlight, with Bill Skarsgård delivering a terrifying and tragic performance as Orlok. The rest of the cast holds their own, adding depth to the horror. However, the script is where things get shaky. Some moments shine, but others feel drawn out or unnecessarily stiff, making the film drag in parts. The score does a solid job of building tension, though it doesn’t always hit as hard as it could.\r\n\r\nOne of the strangest creative choices is the inclusion of an oud and belly dancing in Transylvania during Thomas Hutter’s arrival. The scene is heavily choreographed, with villagers giving him a grand welcome that feels eerie and almost ritualistic. It’s a visually striking moment, but the film never explains its purpose. The oud and dance are Middle Eastern cultural elements, not something tied to Transylvania’s history, and after this elaborate introduction, they are never mentioned again. A single question about it is quickly dismissed, making it feel like the filmmakers threw it in for exoticism without considering whether it made any sense. Nosferatu (2024) is a visually impressive and well-acted film, but its slow pacing, script issues, and odd cultural inaccuracies hold it back. If you’re a fan of classic vampire horror, it’s worth a watch, but it doesn’t do much to stand out from the dozens of Dracula films that came before it.",

  "content": "It’s been said that “life is what you make of it,” that “we become what we believe.” To some, this probably seems like the content of a warm, fuzzy, inspirational greeting card. But, if we truly take the time to examine ourselves and our lives, we’re likely to find that there’s more than a small kernel of truth in these observations. Such is the point of the latest offering from filmmaker Kogonada, who deftly explores how this principle is applied to our romantic lives, especially for those who are single and who believe that they’re all thumbs and hopelessly stymied where questions of love and relationships are concerned. The film follows the quirky, surreal, metaphysically driven experiences of David (Colin Farrell) and Sarah (Margot Robbie), who meet at a destination wedding. Their journey, however, actually begins before they meet when they each lease vehicles from an unusual car rental agency, one that’s more than it seems on the surface and that’s run by a pair of colorfully eccentric proprietors (Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Kevin Kline). As their experience unfolds, these unconventional circumstances continue, revealing that this scenario has much more going for it than meets the eye. And, before long, after the ceremony ends, they spontaneously embark on a road trip of self-discovery, one that takes them through a series of dreamlike, profoundly insightful experiences from their past. These astute re-creations help to show them how they’ve become the individuals they are, particularly where romance is concerned. They’re each initiated by passing through magical doorways to alternate realities to which they’re directed by an unusual, interactive GPS device located in their rental car. These portals walk them through a series of whimsical, increasingly intense, highly personal events that provide enlightening perspectives on their lives and individual natures – and how they needn’t be saddled with their outcomes if they choose not to be. The protagonists’ collective and respective stories are related with an array of emotions – some painful, some delightfully humorous and all of which provide them with an enhanced awareness of their past, present and potential future. As with his previous superb offerings “Columbus” (2017) and “After Yang” (2021), the director has again created a picture that packs a lot to ponder in a single, sensitive, skillfully layered cinematic package. But what sets this film apart from those other releases is its finely interwoven emotional textures, sentiments that create a tapestry covering a wider range of feelings than seen in those previous works. It’s without a doubt the director’s most “commercial” work to date, but Kogonada’s vision of what’s “commercial” is far more substantive and meaningful than what one finds in most contemporary releases, particularly in the romcom genre. There may indeed be an underlying element of the “boy meets girl” formula at work here, but it’s presented with far greater depth than what is typically found in such offerings. All of this is meticulously enhanced by a variety of inspired production elements, including the film’s inventive production design, gorgeous cinematography, smartly compiled soundtrack, perfectly timed comic relief and impressive performances (especially Robbie yet again). Admittedly, there are a few occasions when the pacing could stand some quickening. And the narrative is peppered with a handful of plot devices that might initially seem a little forced or even overly peculiar, but they all work out in the end, rewarding viewers with more than a fair share of revelatory and satisfying “a ha!” moments. When all is said and done, “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey” lives up to every bit of its suitably audacious title, making for both an enlightening watch, as well as a great date night movie. Don’t let this offering’s eccentricities and innovatively original approach keep you from enjoying everything it has to offer. You’re likely to be pleasantly entertained, and you might even learn a little something about yourself in the end, too.",

He’s a wedding to get to so turns up at this warehouse where he is introduced to a Germanically brusque receptionist (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) before driving off in a twenty year old car complete with it’s own, rather individual, form of GPS. He makes it to the nuptials where he encounters the enigmatic “Sarah” (Margot Robbie). She proposes marriage within five minutes, so we get a clue that this rapport is going to be a bit different. Indeed, after a bit of rain and some intervention from their car’s satellite guide and this pair of resolute singletons are soon car-sharing. That’s when they begin a series of reminiscing adventures that start like a Miyazaki mystery with a door in a field, then takes the travellers through a series of increasingly serious, sentimental and melodramatic scenarios that range from the joyous and mischievous to the far more profound. As they proceed, it’s clear that there is a spark developing, but what might come of it? There are a few scenes that might bring back some childhood memories of those nervous and apprehensive firsts we all went through at school, but for the remainder of this feature it seems that the events have been contrived to maximise the drama rather than appear real. She’s got a little more of the plot, but their stories arc in such a predicable, trauma/guilt-ridden, fashion and neither character is really developed anywhere near enough to get past the feeling that was just a wedding hookup movie only we get to act out their “getting to know you” phase instead of listening to it in a chat. Farrell is no natural here and I didn’t find there to be much chemistry with a Robbie who isn’t really sinking much into her part either. Waller-Bridge is clearly here to bring some sort of “Rosa Klebb” style of humour, but her thick vowels added little and by the conclusion I was sadly indifferent. It’s fine, but nothing memorable to see here.",

  "content": "***\"Where does it end?\" -- \"It never ends.\"***\r\n\r\nIf Homer's mythical epic \"The Iliad\" is based on a factual story, that story is magnificently depicted in Wolfgang Petersen's 2004 epic \"Troy.\" In other words, don't expect any goofy 'gods' or 'goddesses' like Athena popping out of thin air because \"Troy\" is a realistic portrayal of the Trojan war.\r\n\r\nMore than that, \"Troy\" is arguably the best sword & sandal epic ever put to film. You name the picture -- \"Samson and Delilah,\" \"Spartacus,\" \"Ben-Hur,\" \"Ulysses,\" \"The Viking Queen,\" “Conan the Barbarian,” \"Braveheart,\" \"Attila,\" \"The Odyssey,\" \"Gladiator,\" etc. -- \"Troy\" is superior. At the very least it’s as good as some of the better flicks just noted, like \"Ben-Hur,\" and far edges out \"Spartacus\" and \"Samson and Delilah.\" As for more recent sword & sandal epics, like the overrated \"Braveheart\" or \"Gladiator,\" \"Troy\" blows 'em out of the water. \r\n\r\nRoger Ebert is a great writer and critic, but his mediocre review of \"Troy\" is all wrong. Ebert's major criticisms, believe it or not, are the main reasons I have such high respect for this film: He complains that Petersen omitted the many Greek 'gods' & 'goddesses' and gripes that the actors perform their roles as believable people and not larger-than-life caricatures. This can, of course, be respectably done, as in the 1955 film \"Ulysses,\" but this is not what Petersen was shooting for in \"Troy.\" His goal, as already noted, was to depict the actual Trojan War on which Homer's myth is based. (Even if it never really took place, wars LIKE IT did).\r\n\r\nRegarding Brad Pitt's heavily criticized performance as Achilles, I couldn’t care less about Pitt until seeing this movie as he does an outstanding job portraying Greece's greatest warrior. No, he's not the bulkiest warrior to ever grace the earth, but he's fast as lightning, confident, expertly skilled and deadly accurate. Even his voice completely fits the role. Eric Bana (from \"Hulk\") is also great as Hector, Achilles' Trojan counterpart, who's sick of war and just wants to live a life of peace with his family. These two have a showdown in the film and it is without a doubt the greatest mano-a-mano sword & sandal duel ever filmed.\r\n\r\nWhat's interesting about the picture is that you never really end up rooting for one side or the other. When Achilles and Hector have their powerful face-off, my wife and I couldn't decide for whom to root. Maybe that's the point. Don't get me wrong, Agamemnon could be viewed as the villain in this picture, and I wasn't rooting for Menelaus when he fights Paris (Orlando Bloom, who seduces Helen, Menelaus' wife), but neither the Greeks nor the Trojans are painted as the 'good guys' or 'bad guys.' They're just people at war, and in war there's no real glory, as Hector points out... and it never ends, as Achilles states. An additional point is that living in a state of war is a JOYLESS existence. And both Bana and Pitt get this across well.\r\n\r\nAs for beautiful women, there are only a couple mentionable: Diane Kruger plays Helen, \"the face that launched a thousand ships.\" Some have complained that she's too plain for the role, but I disagree. I’m not a fan of hers or anything, but she looks pretty dang sharp to me (not to mention has an impressive behind shot). Besides, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. If Paris deems her worthy of starting a war, who are we to disagree? Also on hand is cutie Rose Byrne who plays Briseis, the virgin priestess whom Achilles converts to the pleasures of the flesh.\r\n\r\nI should point out that \"Troy\" was one of the most expensive pictures ever made at the time and it definitely SHOWS on the screen. Make no mistake, \"Troy\" is breath-taking just to WATCH -- the colossal armies, ships and battles are awe-inspiring to behold, not to mention the Maltan and Mexican locations. And the CGI effects are outstanding for the time, not fake-looking like the Rome & Coliseum scenes in \"Gladiator.\" \r\n\r\nAnother complaint by Ebert is that the dialogue is lousy; nothing could be further from the truth. There are great pieces of dialogue interspersed throughout, including Achilles' comment that the 'gods' envy people because we're mortal and \"Everything's beautiful because we're doomed.\" Thankfully, there's not one goofy one-liner anywhere to be found.\r\n\r\nJames Horner's score should also be mentioned. If you enjoyed the soundtrack of \"The Passion of the Christ\" you'll love this one because it's just as good/serious/reverent/powerful. For instance, the intense percussion during Achilles and Hector's showdown is magnificent.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, Brad Pitt, who plays Achilles, injured his Achilles tendon during shooting. Fitting, no? \r\n\r\nFINAL WORD: If you're in the mood for a sword & sandal epic, \"Troy\" more than fills the bill. The story captivates from the get-to and never lets up the entire 2.5 hour runtime (technically 2 hours, 42 minutes, with credits). It extravagantly visualizes the Trojan War for you, something I never did until seeing this mind-blowing, outstanding piece of cinema.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A+",

  "content": "It's yours, take it. \r\n\r\nTrojan prince Paris is not only having an affair with Spartan Menelaus' woman, Helen. He also lures her away to live with him in Troy. Thus giving the global domination obsessed King Agamenon the launch pad to war with Troy. Which in turn brings into conflict Spartan hero Achilles and Hector of Troy, two of the greatest warriors that ever lived.\r\n\r\nTroy, budgeted at $175 million, and given to director Wolfgang Petersen with orders to craft a swordplay epic based on Homer's Illiad, is not the truly great picture it really should have been. It is, however, a spectacle of sorts, that by way of the extended directors cut, becomes a fine enough addition to the genre it so clearly wanted to crown.\r\n\r\nThe problems are evident from the off. The casting of Brad Pitt as Achilles always looked to have been based purely on looks. Nicely toned body and brooding close ups do not a warrior make, and thus, as good an actor as Pitt definitely is, this is a role (and genre) too far. Diane Kruger as Helen is under written, which since at the time was a poor actress yet to bloom turns out to be a bonus here, and Orlando Bloom playing the wimp like Lothario Paris the way he should do - still gets out acted and swamped by all around him. The other main problem is how uneven the story telling is. Petersen looks confused as how to condense the Trojan war in the running time, whilst also juggling the emphasis of the two great warriors at its core. That Eric Bana's excellent portrayal of Hector comes through the jumble is a testament to Bana's ability and nothing else.\r\n\r\nThe good is, well, rather good though. Agamemnon, courtesy of a nasty turn from Brian Cox, is well formed. It gives the picture a reason for being outside of it being a war about some bloke stealing a woman from another bloke. Imperial cravings and a genuine thirst for blood helps lift Troy out of the rocky waters it had found itself in. Peter O'Toole, Brendan Gleeson and Sean Bean do fine work with what little they have got, and the production values on offer are hugely impressive. The fight sequences impact and are full of gusto. The fight off between Hector and Achilles is superbly choreographed (fought out to a score that James Horner has lifted from the one Danny Elfman used for Planet Of The Apes three years earlier) and the battle between the armies outside the walls of troy sits with the best in the genre. CGI is often called the bane of cinema, but when used so well as it is here (see the ships approaching Troy for instance) it proves to be an effective and entertaining tool.\r\n\r\nTroy has problems, of that there is no doubt. But come the end one knows that it has been entertained, one knows that this was a time of heroes. So with that, and the knowledge that the film made a profit of just over £320 million worldwide, Petersen can smugly sit in his chair musing it was job done. 7/10",

You also have a load of other familiar faces, from Peter O'Toole to Brendan Gleeson to Rose Byrne to Diane Kruger.

Sadly, though, the acting isn't at all joined up. At bit like the Dutch football team of the 1980s, we have lots of individual stars but relatively little cohesion between them. Peter O'Toole brings some gravitas as Priam, bit otherwise it's a loose collection of A-lister performances that try their best with a staccato script and some fairly clunky direction. As an end-to-end adventure film, it isn't as bad as it has been accused of being, but it definitely could have done with a deal more emphasis on the characterisation - Brian Cox is dreadful as Agamemnon; Brad Pitt (Achilles), and particularly Eric Bana (Hector) are shockingly wooden; Orlando Bloom (Paris) & Garrett Hedlund (Patroclus) appear there merely as eye-candy and Diane Kruger as the one who launched the thousand ships sounded more like Celine Dion every time she spoke.

  "content": "Troy (2004), directed by Wolfgang Petersen, is a grand cinematic portrayal of the legendary Trojan War, inspired by Homer's Iliad. The film delves into profound themes such as the pursuit of power versus envy, the clash between greed and pride, and the tension between intelligence and blind faith. It also thoughtfully examines the role of divine belief, encapsulated in the poignant line: \"The gods envy us because we're mortal. Everything is more beautiful because we're doomed.\"\r\n\r\nThe movie boasts a stellar ensemble cast, with Brad Pitt delivering a compelling performance as Achilles, Eric Bana as the noble Hector, Orlando Bloom as the naive Paris, and Brian Cox as the ambitious Agamemnon. Each actor brought depth to their roles, making their characters memorable, even if some lacked extensive development due to the sheer scale of the story.\r\n\r\nYes, there are deviations from the source material, but these are inevitable in a cinematic adaptation. A director's artistic vision often necessitates changes to fit the medium of film, and Troy is no exception. While the absence of Greek gods and the condensed timeline might disappoint purists, the movie compensates with its human-focused narrative and emotional gravitas.\r\n\r\nCritics have pointed out that Achilles' character development feels somewhat lacking, but given the packed storyline, there simply wasn't enough time to explore every nuance. Similarly, the pacing and action sequences, though well-executed, missed a certain \"kick\" that could have amplified the film's appeal to action enthusiasts. However, the script shines in its quieter, more reflective moments. The scene between Hector and Paris, where Hector dismantles romanticized notions of war and love, stands out as one of the most powerful and enduring dialogues in cinematic history.\r\n\r\nTroy is not just a film about war but a study of human ambition, mortality, and the pursuit of legacy. Despite its flaws, the movie continues to resonate with audiences, offering unforgettable quotes and themes that remain relevant and praised to this day. Its combination of strong performances, thematic depth, and stunning production values makes Troy a cinematic experience worth revisiting.",

  "content": "This takes for ever to get going and once it does, it’s really an unoriginal semi-comedic horror drama centred around yet another not-so-menacing puppet. This time, it’s squabbling brothers “Hal” and “Bill” who discover an old hat box after their father dies and in it is what looks like a toy monkey. They wind it up and next thing, their babysitter is no more and that’s the just the start of it’s malevolence. Putting two and two together, they decide it’s best to drop the thing down a well and get on with growing up. Scoot on years later and now “Hal” (Theo James) has a son of his own “Petey” (Colin O’Brien) and is trying to rebuild some bridges with him after his marriage collapsed. Equally estranged is his twin, so he’s not impressed when, out of the blue, he is called and told their aunt has died. He now has to drag the reluctant lad along to the home they grew up in and guess what is in the wardrobe? At times it’s quite funny, but I’m not sure how intentional that is as James delivers a seriously flat performance and the epitome of sibling rivalries involves a frankly risible degree of menace. It’s not that the idea is rubbish, though it is derivative, it’s that the acting and writing are poor and the scenarios - familial discord, new stepdad (Elijah Wood) etc. are all just too predictable and it provides virtually nothing new over a lacklustre one hundred minutes. I could certainly think of a few good uses for the chimp, though!",

  "content": "Compelled to be presented to the Queen as a debutante in return for an Oxford University education, Rose Dugdale (Imogen Poots) rebels from a fairly early age. Her privileged upbringing - as so often happens - leads her to detest the very hands that fed her in her childhood. Meantime, the troubles in Northern Ireland in the early 1970s are only increasing and after a trip to a training camp in Cuba, she returns a fully capable, bomb-making, terrorist - with a brain and a conscience. A plot is devised to rob a stately home of some valuable Goya, Rubens and Vermeer paintings and hold them as hostage for £500,000 and the freedom of two hunger striking IRA prisoners incarcerated in the UK. What now ensues is a rather weekly constructed speculation as to just how this shrewd plan was executed and of the aftermath. The story is an interesting history - but with the timelines dancing around all over the place and the performance of Poots a bit hit or miss, I found the pace of the film too bitty. We are all too often left dangling when a storyline is being developed and talking of development, there is very little to inform us about who the real Dugdale was. The screenplay doesn't shy away from describing the radicalisation here nor of some of it's concomitant brutality but somehow her vitriolic detestation of the British state is left completely unexplained. This subject could make for a strong political documentary on a woman who was clearly dedicated to her cause, but as a drama - this doesn't ever really engage.",

  "content": "(As I'm writing this review, Darth Vader's theme music begins to build in my mind...)\r\n\r\nWell, it actually has a title, what the Darth Vader theme. And that title is \"The Imperial March\", composed by the great John Williams, whom, as many of you may already know, also composed the theme music for \"Jaws\" - that legendary score simply titled, \"Main Title (Theme From Jaws)\".\r\n\r\nNow, with that lil' bit of trivia aside, let us procede with the fabled film currently under review: Star Wars. It had been at a drive-in theater in some small Illinois town or other where my mother, my older brother, and I had spent our weekly \"Movie Date Night\" watching this George Lucas directed cult masterpiece from our car in the parking lot. On the huge outdoor screen, the film appeared to be a silent one, but thanks to an old wire-attached speaker, we were able to hear both the character dialogue and soundtrack loud and clear. We even had ourselves a carful of vittles and snacks - walked back to our vehicle, of course, from the wide-opened cinema's briefly distant concession stand. Indeed, it had been a lovely summer evening that July.\r\n\r\nFrom the time the film started, with my brother and I following along as our mother sped-read the opening crawl, I began to feel rather antsy, thinking that this movie, the first in a franchise that would soon be world-renowned, was going to be boring, due to its genre being Science Fiction: A respectably likable, but not a passionately lovable genre of mine DURING THAT TIME. I just didn't believe I was going to like Star Wars all that much ... But I soon found myself intrigued ... And awed.\r\n\r\nGeorge Lucas is a man with a phenomenal, and I do mean phenomenal imagination. Apart from his human characters (Han, Luke, Leia, and Obi-Wan Kenobi, among others), the droids: C-3P0, R2-D2, R2-series, and IG-88, not to mention those unusual characters like Jabba the Hutt, Yoda, and Chewbacca, just to name a few, are all creations of Lucas's phenomenal imagination. And I was completely in awe of each one of these strange beings. Then there was Vader ... And the evil Emperor ... And the Stormtroopers ... And the Spacecraft ... And the galaxies (I'll admit that I am a huge lover of the Universe in all its Celestial glory) ... And the magnificent planets ... The Lightsabers ... And so on. Star Wars is a gorgeously shot space opera; it is truly an epic masterpiece. We enjoyed this film tremendously. And my brother was a die-hard fan from that night onward. He, my brother, had even received for Christmas that year, nearly every Star Wars action figure that my mother could find, including two of the spacecraft: The Millennium Falcon and Star Destroyer. The Death Star space station had too been wrapped beneath our Christmas tree - tagged with his name. It was totally crazy, what the new Star Wars era. Frenzied! But it was great ... Even still, to this day.\r\n\r\nI don't personally know anyone whom has yet to see Star Wars, but that certainly doesn't suggest there are still a few people out there who haven't. And if you're one of the latter, then you should know that this classic space opera comes highly recommended. The entire series is told backwards, so you'll definitely want to see Star Wars first, followed by its two sequels: The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi ... In that order. I trust that you'll too discover yourself to be a lifelong cult fan in the wake. 😊",

  "content": "A long time ago in a childhood not too far away...\r\n\r\nPrincess Leia is captured and held hostage by the Imperial Army as it seeks to rule the Galactic Empire. An old Jedi Knight by the name of Ben \"Obi-Wan\" Kenobi may just be hers, and the rebels only hope. Teaming up with farm boy Luke Skywalker, scoundrel Captain Han Solo, and a couple of quirky droids, Kenobi sets off on a mission that could well shape the destiny of the Galaxy, and all who dwell within it.\r\n\r\nBack in 1977 I was but a wee 11 year old boy, weened on films from all genres by my movie loving parents, I had no idea that Star Wars was to have the same impact on me as Jaws had two summers previously, where yet again I found myself queueing around the block for two whole hours to see a film in a one screen theatre. My love of cinema firmly cemented, Star Wars was the start of a love affair that lasts to this very day.\r\n\r\nAs the years have rolled by and my love of cinema has taken on more in-depth and serious tones, I have come to realise that Star Wars proves to be a far from flawless picture. Certainly its detractors do point to some frayed acting and call the plot structure a jazzed up good versus evil axis, while the charge of George Lucas referencing many prior pictures most assuredly stands, but really do those things matter? No they do not, because Star Wars opened up a new world of cinema, something of a portal to youngsters such as I, it got people talking and debating about the merits of model work in films (which is of an extraordinary high standard here), it nudged film makers to explore being bigger and bolder in their approach, and crucially, above all else, it got film goers hungry again, a hankering for more please if you may. Now it has to be said that all that followed 20th Century Fox's historic blockbuster didn't run with the baton, in fact most pale into comparison on impact value, but for better or worse (depending on the discerning viewers peccadilloes), Star Wars stands as a bastion of adventure laden entertainment.\r\n\r\nIt is by definition one of the most successful films in history, George Lucas perhaps didn't know it at the time, but in what was to become an almost operatic anthology, he didn't just make a movie, he created a whole new world seeping with style and rich texture. Almost as amazing as the success of the series, is how it has become part of modern day pop culture, anything from religion to everyday speak has at some time or another referenced Lucas' baby. Ultimately, though, it's one single thing that made (and still does make) Star Wars so great, it's that it has the ability to lift the audience into a rousing united feel good cheer; and that is something that few films can ever lay claim too. In 1977 it was an awe inspiring event to watch in the theatre, now here in my middle age it's an event that is like hugging a dear old friend, a friend that I know will never ever let me down no matter how many times I turn to it. 10/10",

I've heard a lot about <em>'Star Wars'</em> so I am expecting big things, this didn't disappoint whatsoever.\r\n\r\nI unquestionably enjoyed this! If I didn't know this was released in 1977 I would never have guessed, it still holds up astonishingly well. The special effects are spectacular for the vast, vast majority; even the stuff that perhaps hasn't aged as supremely still looks superb.\r\n\r\nThe cast are a joy. I actually wouldn't say any performance sensationally stood out, but all the actors and all the characters are so much fun to watch together. Mark Hamill is impressive as Luke, Harrison Ford is entertaining as Han and Carrie Fisher is super as Leia. Credit also to James Earl Jones and Alec Guinness, among others. Despite not watching until now, I literally already knew all of the character names - shows how timeless these are.\r\n\r\nThe plot makes for top notch viewing, I found the pacing to be particularly spot on. And how about that score? Stupendous! I really have no negatives for this, I'm sure it isn't perfect but I had a very fun time with it.",

  "content": "Everyone and their mother is going to write reviews about the Star Wars movies...and this one, this one actually came out before I was born.\r\n\r\nIt breaks the heart. I had to wait until the re-release before I got to see this one on the big screen. This is the one that ruined my Star Wars opening night streak...\r\n\r\n...Well The Force Awakens ALMOST ruined it further. I had to drive out to my parents house just to see it, for the sake of tradition, and when I got there they had already gone without me...twice.\r\n\r\nSome angry words later and I guilted my mom, pointing out the drive, to force her into a third go.\r\n\r\nBut that is neither here nor there.\r\n\r\nThis was the movie that started it all. And the first time I saw it, it was on Beta. Once upon a time my family had the movie in Beta. And then I had the trilogy in VHS. And then I had it on DVD. And it is going to repeat like that as the mediums change.\r\n\r\nIts one of those movies that you have to own, even as technology changes. It is actually one of those movies you want to buy right away when the technology changes, just to see it in better and better quality.\r\n\r\nThat should be saying something right there. But for a lot of you its not.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of you, it is a fairy tale in space, complete with knights and old wizards and a princess. Only its a fairy tale in space made for, well, made for nerds like me.\r\n\r\nIt is a legend and the type of legend that stays with people and makes old Gen-Xers like me, cynical and grumpy, feel like little kids again.\r\n\r\nIt, along with the Godfather, is the type of movie that breeds mental spousal abuse as generations of men force their wives at gunpoint to watch them...and then get confused and a little depressed when most of them don't see the fascination with them.\r\n\r\nUnlike the Godfather, however, its the movie that fathers force their children to watch and, then, their children carry the love for it into the next generation.\r\n\r\nStar Wars is an endless cycle, even the bad ones are good. And the fans create endless theories about them. They buy the t-shirts, the buy the toys, they do everything they can to preserve that love and pass it on.\r\n\r\nA New Hope, this is the film that started all of that, and though there are better installments, this will always be the first.",

Leaving aside the magnificent special effects; this is a film about good and evil; empire, freedom and democracy and of their true characterisations.

One by one, the islands of personality fall apart as the rest of the gang back in headquarters watch in dismay and anguish. After all, Joy is not there to keep things under control.\r\n\r\nInside Out truly contemplates the hardships of growing up, but every problem comes to a heart-wrenching solution.

  "content": "\"Riley\" is a pleasant little girl living with her parents in Minnesota where she plays ice hockey, has loads of friends and generally, all in her garden is rosey. Her parents decide they need to move to (a rather drab) house in San Francisco, though, and as you might expect this causes some new tensions, especially as their furniture seems to have been lost in transit! Inside her pretty little head, we see her emotions - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness personified and vying for control of her personality during this lively time. Joy seems most adept at managing the situation and keeping things on an even keel, but after an inadvertent intervention from sadness, the two find themselves expelled from the control room and having to make their way back from deep within her memories before it all comes crashing down at the hands of those less optimistic sensations left in charge! It's almost as if there is an \"X-Factor\" judging panel inside everyone's head making decisions and discussing with each other which of their traits ought to prevail as circumstances dictate - and in the main it works well. It ultimately serves to advise that none of these emotions can exist in isolation and that we must learn to take the rough with the smooth, the good with the not so good. The animation is entertaining, some humour amongst the more thought-provoking stuff; a proper \"train of thought\" and a childhood friend \"Bing Bong\" whose role in her life is fading as she grows up. I loved the ending - not least because any sequel would have to deal with the big red \"puberty\" button on their console and a lot of mischief could be had here.",

  "content": "I was quite nervous when I saw this. I was expecting a sort of hybrid of \"Another Country\" meets \"Brideshead Revisited\" as the story of \"Ollie\" (Barry Keoghan) and his aristocratic pal \"Felix\" (Jacob Elordi) unfolds. Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of \"Felix\" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous \"Farleigh\" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and \"Ollie\" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",

  "content": "Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don’t like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn’t care much for her debut outing, “Promising Young Woman” (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, “Saltburn.” This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn’t care less. (Think “The Killing of a Sacred Deer” (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep’s clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to engender viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It’s the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one’s watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What’s more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it’s a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there’s the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who’s quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director’s cinematic predecessor attempted to do. Save your money, and don’t waste your time on this vastly overrated release from a vastly overrated filmmaker.",

This one is a bit tricky one to review without spoilers so if want to see the review stop right here.\r\n\r\nIt tells a story about the scholarship student Oliver Quick (Barry Keoghan) early in the 2000 that struggle to be accepted into the high class Oxford University. He manages to met Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi) a popular student and befriends it being closer and closer in friendship with him, till he shares his sad family story background. Then he is invited to be at vacations at Saltburn, an magnificent summer place in the fields of England where he meets the eccentric and decadent family of Felix, Rosamund Pike (Lady Elspeth Catton, Felix's mother), Richard E. Grant (as Sir James Catton, Felix's father), Alison Oliver (as Venetia Catton, Felix's sister) and Archie Madekwe (as Farleigh Start, Felix's annoying cousin).\r\n\r\nWith a solid production structure with cinematography by Linus Sandgren (I must highlight this one how it works adjusting to the mood of the unfolding story), edition by Victoria Boydell and music by\r\nAnthony Willis, the movie have it greatest merit in an area that Fennel already showed before - the script. \r\n\r\nSimplifying all things the story that have some sordid sex scenes and gives hints that Ollie isn't so nice in the head as he seems, it develops almost like Promising Young Woman, to a revelling ending of a serial killer and social alpinist in the last 30min of the movie. Not something that we wouldn't foresee by the attitudes of the protagonist and background of the director / writer but nice anyway. So much that seems that I enjoyed it more than most of the people I follow.  \r\n\r\nGuess that we maybe have another contender for Academy nomination of screenplay, director and acting here. A Solid 7.9 out of 10.0 / B+ here.",

Main plot-wise, it's not a hard one to predict... or at least not quite as unpredictable as the film possibly thinks it is based on the 'reveals' (?) at the end, but again: never a bad thing if done correctly. The main takeaway from all this is certainly the unsettling stuff.\r\n\r\nThis 2023 production also holds fantastic cast performances. Barry Keoghan is top notch, I've seen various people online rave about him as an actor but I hadn't really seen it until now. Jacob Elordi merits praise too, as does Rosamund Pike - another one I haven't previously been too keen on, though she is fun here. In fact, on paper it's an iffy cast to me. In reality, the cast are perfect. Credit also to Richard E. Grant, Alison Oliver and Archie Madekwe.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, <em>'Saltburn'</em> is a great movie! A must-watch, I'd say. Emerald Fennell is two for two with me now, after I also highly enjoyed <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/promising-young-woman/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Promising Young Woman</a>'</em> <em>(same rating, fwiw)</em>.",

If you watch ‘The Good Place’ or ‘The Simpsons’, there are parts where you laugh along with the writers but you know it’ll go over kids’ heads. This was definitely a 15 in what it showed but I blushed at what was inferred. Having heard of ‘the bath scene’ or the ‘graveyard scene’, I was concerned, and more surprised by the 'vampire' scene and that the necrophilia actually occurred elsewhere.

It's really a desperate attempt to regain control over his unimaginably painful and traumatic experiences. Deep down he just wants to held gently and for someone to be on his side, but he doesn't really believe he deserves it. After all, no one has ever treated him like that, and the only love interest he ever had, didn't reciprocate his feelings. And then Doumeki comes around...\r\n\r\nThe story handles heavy topics, and the way these things are portrayed without being glossed over is incredible. As you progress in the storyline, you can't help but feel sad and angry about how unfair life can be. You really want to pull your hair out watching adults violently misstreat, abandon, and neglect children and what an immense and lasting impact it has on their lives.\r\n\r\nThat being said, this movie is just the beginning of the story, barely scratching the surface of what's to come. It somewhat falls short in displaying the depth of the characters and their past. I recommend anyone who isn't bothered by exlicit scenes and had a slight interest in the movie and its topics to read the manga. I guarantee you, this story won't leave your feelings untouched.",

  "content": "Directed by Steven Spielberg, the name is enough. He enjoys immense love and justified appreciation. It’s not just a rumour, but his name transcends to million footfalls to theatres and multiple OTT replays. But this movie is special because as a Jew Spielberg felt the pain of Holocaust and thus this was personal. Spielberg’s paternal grandparents were Jews from Ukraine. I really hope things cool down very soon in Ukraine and somebody someday make a film on the crisis in Ukraine.\r\n\r\nAfter watching “The Kashmir Files” I felt like watching the list because I wanted to see how we can make better movies without the propaganda. The Kashmir Files is necessary minus the very few political flaws and propaganda it subtly injects into its viewers. Asking the questions is not anti-national and not all JNU people come with an agenda. Kashmir Files tells many truths and ought to be told but also hides a lot of the actual/factual truths. Just like a dictator it blatantly shows only the side they want to without any iota of balance.\r\n\r\nBut Schindler’s List is different because it never lets the bleakness of the Holocaust overwhelm its important theme of fighting for the common good. The director says, “My primary purpose in making Schindler’s List was for education. The Holocaust had been treated as just a footnote in so many textbooks or not mentioned at all. Millions knew little if anything about it. Others tried to deny it happened at all.”\r\n\r\nKeneally’s best-known work, Schindler’s Ark was published in 1982; also known as Schindler’s List and film released in 1993, tells the true story of Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist who saved more than 1,300 Jews from the Nazis. . Liam Neeson plays very well Schindler however shows his true side that he was a playboy and so on. He was not a saint. He cheated on his wife, drank excessively and spied for Abwehr, the counter-espionage arm of the Wehrmacht (German army), in Czechoslovakia.\r\n\r\nBut the true characteristics of human beings cannot be spliced even in the most fascist regimes. Sometimes character flaws bring in real joy, excitement and belief. Steven Spielberg’s movie, Schindler’s List, while important, impressive and admirable in many respects, tries to show the true face of propaganda and mass bullshit and how an entire nation can be mass brainwashed to fuel hatred amoung it’s people and bring a great nation down. Something India and Indians need to really ponder upon.\r\n\r\nAfter Germany invaded Poland in 1939, Oskar Schindler sets up an enamelware factory in Krakow that used a combination of Jewish workers interred by the Germans and free Polish workers. His initial interest, of course, was to make money. But as time went on, he grew to care about his Jewish workers, particularly those with whom he came into contact on a daily basis. In addition, helping Jews became a way to fight against what he viewed as disastrous and brutal policies emanating from Adolf Hitler and the SS. Oskar Schindler convinced German authorities his factory was vital and that he needed trained workers. But Schindler did not author or dictate the list instead, Marcel Goldberg, a Jewish “clerk” compiled it. There is a line in the movie which goes like, “That’s not just good old fashioned Jew hate talk. Its policy now” and it hits hard and makes us aware that nothing has changed in present too. Itzhak Stern, played in the movie by Ben Kingsley was one of the most powerful character more of culmination of lot of people at that time. Oskar Schindler was a great man publicly and a not so great man privately but he saved the lives of more than 1,000 Jews during the Holocaust and that’s why a movie has been made on him. The imperfections in his character and the nuances in the historical record only make his story more remarkable.\r\n\r\nThe movie’s budget was just $22 million. No one had ever made a profitable film about the Holocaust. Spielberg himself didn’t take a salary, calling it “blood money.” Something Vivek Agnihotri and makers of “The Kashmir Files” should ponder upon. As I write this Kashmir Files has already touched 250 Cr. Such sensitive films should come with not just spontanity but also empathy which is found in Spielberg and lacks in Agnihotri’s.\r\n\r\nThis movie reminded me of another Spielberg movies which moved and caved in Bridge of Spies. Bridge was about the fine art of negotiation and the List is about the fine art of “Gratitude” you will hear this word a lot in the Schindler’s List. I felt both the movies very similar and fantastic.\r\n\r\nThe use of black and white cinematography also makes me think of “KOTA FACTORY” both shot in black and white to resemble the dark and hollowness of the subject material. Art does make you uncomfortable and that’s it’s Dharma and Karma but propoganda does give you only the bigoted narration with giving the example that his master is always a good guy.\r\n\r\nIn one scene, Schindler implores Goeth to spray water into the cars on a hot day to help the dehydrated Jews inside. Goeth tells him that to do so would give false hope—a clear implication that the trains deliver Jews to their deaths.The lists become increasingly ominous during sorting exercises to determine who is fit to work or who is “essential” and who is not. Those deemed “unessential” are placed on the list to be evacuated to extermination camps. Stern’s name appears on a list sending him to Auschwitz. When Schindler saves him, an SS officer mentions that it doesn’t matter which Jew gets on the train, and that keeping track of names just means more paperwork. This disregard for names and particularity symbolizes the extent to which the Nazis dehumanized Jews. Schindler’s list is one that saves lives. The Nazis’ lists represent evil and death, but Schindler’s list represents pure good and life. In an ironic twist, the final list in the film is a list that Schindler’s workers give to him—a list of their signatures vouching for Schindler as a good man, to help him if Allied soldiers catch him. The saved in turn become saviors.\r\n\r\nThe one-armed man who thanks Schindler for employing him and making him “essential” is shot in the head by an SS officer as he shovels snow the next day. Blood flows from his head, staining the surrounding snow. In a later scene, Goeth orders the execution of a Jewish woman engineer who tells Goeth of a fatal construction error. Her blood, too, pours from her head and darkens the snow around her. The blood pouring from the victims’ heads is both literally and metaphorically the lifeblood being bled out of the Jewish race. In yet another scene, Goeth attempts to execute a rabbi working at the Plaszów labor camp. The rabbi stays kneeling as Goeth again and again attempts to shoot him in the head. But the gun jams, and the rabbi is spared, symbolizing the tenuous protection the Schindlerjuden had and the fine line between life and death.\r\n\r\nThe film talks about the corruption of not just money but hearts and minds too. It shows us privileges and different aspects of life while keeping humanity before profits and ideologies. Intricacies of personal and professional lives are intertwined here for the good sake.\r\n\r\nThe film ends with – “WHOEVER SAVES ONE LIFE, SAVES THE WORLD ENTIRE.”\r\n\r\nThe actual Oskar Schindler died in 1974 and was buried in Jerusalem on Mount Zion. He is the only former member of the Nazi Party to be honored in this way. He and his wife Emilie were named Righteous Among the Nations by the Israeli government in 1993, something that would be hard to believe could happen without the film highlighting his life. \r\n\r\nAs we all know, Spielberg and the film went on to win several Academy Awards for Schindler’s List, including Best Picture and Best Director. The film also won for Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Editing. Spielberg would win another Best Director Oscar for Saving Private Ryan five years later, but for him what happened with Schindler would be his crowning achievement. \r\n\r\nSchindler’s List is a rare movie whose legacy is just as important as its existence.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the lasting legacy of the film, aside from tolerance, is the image of the girl in red. During the liquidation of the ghetto scene, we see a little girl wandering. She serves as the person Schindler and the audience fixate on. The weight of the atrocity that we carry as viewers.When prompted to talk about one of the only color moments in the film, the girl in red, Spielberg told USA Today, “In (Thomas Keneally’s) book, Schindler couldn’t get over the fact that a little girl was walking during the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto. While everyone was being put on trucks or shot in the street, one little girl in a red, red coat was being ignored by the SS.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Spielberg, that came to symbolize the blind eye world leaders turned to the murders going on in Europe. “To me, that meant that Roosevelt and Eisenhower—and probably Stalin and Churchill—knew about the Holocaust… and did nothing to stop it. It was almost as though the Holocaust itself was wearing red.” Same repeats in Ukraine too.\r\n\r\nSpielberg helped develop and found The Shoah Foundation. It furthered the education and established “The Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation” to document the testimonies of thousands of survivors. For Spielberg, he wanted future generations to have these eyewitness accounts to serve as a permanent record. He hoped that there would never be a time we saw Nazism and fascism on the rise again. The project has collected the testimony of more than 55,000 survivors and witnesses to the Holocaust as well as other atrocities. “It wouldn’t have happened without Schindler’s List,” he said. “The Shoah Foundation wouldn’t exist.” Something the Hypocritic Vivek Agnihotri should think about. I still stand by that “The Kashmir files” should be shown to everyone without propoganda and only one agenda that this atrocities and “Genocide” should not be repeated on any one anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe film is available on Netflix. Go, watch, think.\r\n\r\nhttps://letterboxd.com/mayurpanchamia/film/schindlers-list/\r\n\r\nhttps://mayurpanchamia.wordpress.com/2022/03/27/schindlers-list/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.themoviedb.org/review/62405d62706e56005dc24c03",

  "content": "There's a powerful little low-budget effort with Ralph Richardson called \"The Silver Fleet\" (1943) that illustrates just how difficult it was for those in the occupied territories to continue to do what was right without looking like a collaborator and/or ending up against a wall of Nazi bullets. Well here, Steven Spielberg takes that dangerous occupation and scales it up somewhat as the eponymous Czech industrialist and arms manufacturer (Liam Neeson) finds his increasing revulsion to the brutality of their new occupying power driving him, with the able assistance of his Jewish factory manager \"Stern\" (Ben Kingsley), to find ways to keep them from being routinely slaughtered. Getting them out is not really an option, so he invents ways of convincing the authorities that they are more useful alive and decently fed/housed - even suggesting the usefulness of children's small fingers to polish shell casings - to avoid them being deported to the now fully functioning Auchwitz extermination camp. The story is history but the manner in which it is delivered here is poignant and potent. Schindler's gradual shift from a venally induced indifference to one of active concern is well handled by Neeson's considered performance and Kingsley works well as his low-level but crucial co-conspirator. Plaudits must also go to Ralph Fiennes with, I think, the best portrayal of his career as the odious Commandant Goeth who combines just about every element of the worst in human nature into one ghastly individual eliciting a palpable degree of loathing. Does it need to be 3¼ hours long? Well I'm not so sure about that, and there are times when the repetitive oppressiveness of their gruelling environment risks de-sensitising the message a little, but for the most part the abusive and terrifying lives led by the Jewish prisoners and the increasingly perilous path being taken by those trying to help is well held together with some stunning cinematography and an untypical John Williams score. It's definitely a big screen occasion - somehow television reduces it's impact, so if you can see it in a cinema. Either way, it does offer some salutary lessons in man's inhumanity, and humanity to our fellow man!",

  "content": "Emotionally powerful and historically very important. This film deals with possibly the hardest topic in human history, and it does it with class, purpose and excellent filmmaking. Liam Neeson is brilliant as Schindler; Fiennes is utterly horrifying as the terrible Goth and all the other character actors hit the mark brilliantly. The decision to make it black and white makes Schindler's List stand-out and feel distinct, it is a piece of genius. In the end this film is about the utter depravity that humanity is capable of, and the utterly brilliant heroism humanity is capable of, WW2 and the Holocaust in real life brought out the worst in us as a species and it bought out the best of us, this film captures that, but it also captures the complexities of the people at the heart of the most dramatic events in world history, no other film does this as well. Top quality and a very good start point for people who are unfimilar with the nitty-gritty of the Nazi regime.",

I thought it was a great film, but I was 13 and it played on my love for history.\r\n\r\nNow watching it, it's well done, direction wise I like it.  But Mel Brooks did a better job with B&W lighting in Young Frankenstein.  I know photography, I know film, and a lot of it I wouldn't have done that way. I wouldn't have done it that way and they are really simple lighting and contrast fixes. Some just comes down to a filter. \r\n\r\nAnd then Ralph Fiennes, you hated him in the movie, but you hated him because of who he was playing, and you were supposed to hate him.  He's hardly in the film and he did the most memorable job.  You almost forget that Liam Neeson is in it. Ralph he even outshines Ben Kingsley, and Ben's certainly made bad choices, but he's usually a good actor all the time.\r\n\r\nWatching it now, there's a lot that really should have been done better.  I'm not 13 anymore, it's a AAA flick, there's a lot wrong with it now that I can't get beyond.\r\n\r\nIt's not bad. I'd still tell you to watch it, it's still an important movie, but now it irritates me.",

  "content": "> Sure, everyone finds their pine tree.\r\n\r\nThe film was produced by three countries from three different continents, carved by one of my favoutire French directors that talks of a prodigy child. An English language film set in the American soil. If you had liked his films, then you would like this one as well. Like all his films, it was visually fantastic and it was his first digital 3D project. One of the underrated film of the recent time. A road adventure and a coming-of-age film that neatly rendered especially for the family and children film fans.\r\n\r\nMore like it was a kid version of 'Amelie' and now I realise why the author picked this particular foreign filmmaker for the cinematic translation. This is not some kid's summer vacation tale or the school related stuff, but a rural kid and his weird family. They're united by family, but divided by their field of interest. Born in such family, the film focused his life and mostly the fighting of his loneliness.\r\n\r\nIt was based on the book about a 12 year old boy T.S. Spivet who lives on a ranch in the Rockies with his family. He's a scientific research enthusiastic and so one day he receives an unusual call from the Washington DC that he had won a prestigious award for his invention. After a sudden tragedy in the house he set to travel by his own to the other side of the country. The adventure begins as he hitchhike to his destination where he learns many things.\r\n\r\n> \"The amazing thing about water drops, is that they always take the path of least resistance. For humans, it's exactly the opposite.\"\r\n\r\nThe kid was brilliant, it was his perspective story. In one of the scenes when he gets hurt, that felt like it was real. His co-stars supported him all the way, but not as a game changer. You might agree with me that it is not a great story, somewhat familiar too, but the film topic is inspiring like how an atypical family cooperates during the bad times that compared with their negligence to each other at one point before. There are a few fun moments, but also gets emotional at the final part.\r\n\r\nThe train journey had lots of effects on the narration, because I'd seen a road movie, but this is a very rare, especially it gives us some glimpse over awesome landscapes of different part of the country. Like I said, the cinematography was the best part of the film followed by many others. In the end, I was very satisfied for it is being somewhat simple with having an extraordinary boy character. Because, you know, genius boy means usually the writers goes for an extra mile to make him shine with his brain powers to perhaps face the bad guys or the bad situations for which the audience sets to go awe.\r\n\r\nReally very sad that it was not as popular as 'Hugo' where everyone who saw it comparing with, especially for the digital 3D visuals. That tells how much the people are addicted to Hollywood and of course marketing was not upto the standards as against the film's standard. In fact, it took me two years to learn such film is exist. So I definitely recommend it to all. If you have not seen it yet, just do it, you might like it, surely you would enjoy it.\r\n\r\n8/10",

I very much enjoy it, especially the location of the finale.\r\n\r\nTom Hanks is again fabulous as Woody, while Tim Allen (Buzz) & Co. remain as entertaining as before. They also introduce some cool new characters, with the standout being Jessie who is voiced astutely by Joan Cusack; Jessie's backstory is so well done. Al (Wayne Knight) and Pete (Kelsey Grammer) are good additions, too.\r\n\r\nThere are some tremendous scenes here, that one for Cusack's character and the conclusion are my favourites alongside the ultra satisfying restoration scene; the end credits are amusing, also. It's all fun.\r\n\r\nThe other two sequels are brilliant, but this is the pick of the three. I'd highly recommend, evidently.",

Sadly, though, \"Woody\" has hurt his arm - so is left behind, only to narrowly escape being sold in a car boot sale. Worryingly, though, he is spotted there by toy museum owner \"McWiggin\" and is promptly kidnapped! It now falls to \"Buzz\", \"Mr Potato Head\" and the rest of the gang to track him down and spring him, with his new friend \"Jessie\" before they are sold to a collector in Japan. Not all of the toys are on board though - and poor old \"Woody\" has to be wary of the double-dealing \"Prespector\" whilst \"Buzz\" finds that, unlike his abducted friend, he is not exactly unique! There are now plenty of fun escapades for all concerned to keep this high quality animation entertaining. That said, I don't really do sentimentality, and I found this to be a little more so than the first one. The introduction of \"Jessie\" accompanied by the rather sad story of her abandonment (set to an equally sad song) did drag the pace down a bit for me, but when the action kicks in again, then we revert to a first-rate, team-driven and wittily written tale of camaraderie, loyalty and ingenuity. Messrs. Hanks, Allen and Rickles keep up their established good work, this time joined by Joan Cusack and an on form Kelsey Grammer as \"Prospector\". It could be argued that the first \"Toy Story\" film was a marketing man's wet dream; this second feature is very nearly as good and demonstrates the enduring and engaging nature of the characters who value each other above all.

  "content": "One would think that the ultimate showdown between two of the most iconic super-heroes would make for some downright compelling action-oriented exploits against a landscape of angst and destruction. Plus, it certainly did not hurt that exhilarating filmmaker Zack Snyder (‘300’) was at the helm in bringing together the colorfully and concocted confrontation between The Caped Crusader and The Man of Steel. Also, it should have been an effortless task to bring together **Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice** leading men Ben Affleck and Henry Cahill since they had prior experiences donning heroic attire as mighty super-heroes on call to save the day. So why then does Snyder’s big-budgeted connect-the-dots comic book caper feel so incoherently stiff and aimless?\r\n\r\nThe dour randomness of **Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice** is quite disappointing because this moping actioner wants to grab more than it can chew in its crowded mouth. Snyder and screenwriters David S. Goyer and Chris Terrio aspire to plug in such contemplative issues pertaining to moral ambivalence, political platitudes and religious themes but none of these factors energize or sustain this action-packed narrative that seems to slouch all at the expense of a sluggish approach to the mechanical hedonism that labors.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that **Dawn of Justice** has its share of visual opulence as this is obviously expected in an expansive superhero saga where the proven selling point are two mythical comic book titans spearheading the pumped-up proceedings. Again an overreaching script that plods along, a couple of super-powered sourpusses going the moody motions and the lack of carefree robust action undermine the potential explosiveness that **Dawn of Justice** could have capitalized on with dynamic aplomb.\r\n\r\nSure, there is a noted curiosity and interesting element about the topic of “heroism fatigue” and hidden demons that could have certainly contributed to the psychological strain for our Caped Courageous Ones. Still, **Dawn of Justice** never quite turns this premise into a sparkling case of burn-out conviction, Instead, knuckle-dragging duo of Bruce Wayne/Batman (Affleck) and Clark Kent/Superman (Cavell) make the common sleeping pill look like an excitable bag of M&M candy treats. Thankfully, another fan favorite superhero in the form of Wonder Woman (Gal Godot) is thrown into the mix to break up the monotony of the boorish Boys Club. Unfortunately, the appearance of the wily Wonder Woman during the tail end of the second half is too little and too late for her welcomed presence to rescue the film’s clunky pacing.\r\n\r\nGotham’s Bruce Wayne and Metropolis’s Clark Kent are experiencing setbacks that could be perceived as reaching the depressive crossroads. For starters, a maturing Wayne’s/Batman’s crime-fighting prospects have been tailing off drastically. As for Kent/Superman his existence at the Daily Planet newspaper seems mundane especially when his boss in editor Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) declares that the public has moved away from print given the major impact of social media and other online resources. So yes…Wayne and Kent are in a critical funk in their professional lives both in and out of their familiar costumes. However, can the slumping cities afford two down-and-out superheroes when one can probably carry the load in rough, unsure times?\r\n\r\nWhen the film establishes the dilemma that there can be only one muscle-bound ego to handle the affairs of the region’s unprotected this is where the **Batman v Superman** portion of **Dawn of Justice** looks as if the frenetic fantasy will percolate. Inexplicably, the hype involving the sparring twosome is put on hold as the exposition takes its tedious time building up the conflict to satisfy the clashing insecurities of the capable caped crime-stoppers. For those that witnessed Cavell’s mediocre **Man of Steel** a few years ago will probably understand the current bad blood that exists between the two super studs. Whatever the case both Batman and Superman have pegged each other as brawny bad news ambassadors…something that does not sit well with either struggling superhero as their revered reputations are on the line.\r\n\r\nNaturally, there are other outside forces to consider as the acrimonious overtones continue to flow between the brooding mega-powers. The famed instigator in Superman foe Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) is realized as the high-tech billionaire nuisance that has an underlying scheme to eradicate both bickering super powers once and for all but not before Luthor pronounces his take on philosophical tirades. In the meantime, Lois Lane (Amy Adams) is on board to profess her undying love and support for her desired dreamboat Superman. Luthor loathing Superman while Lane fantasizing about her strong flashy fly boy. In other words it is business as usual. While Superman is trying to figure out his place in the sun Snyder piles on the bothersome dreamy anxieties that plague the aging Wayne.\r\n\r\n**Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice** is a jumbled mess. Snyder undertakes a convoluted production and tries to sell it as a sophisticated meeting of the misplaced minds between two embattled entities embroiled in uncertainty and super-sized cynicism. Still, Snyder’s vision is mishandled as he seems to have forgotten one crucial point–simply making an action movie that registers with genuine thrills. One cannot help but stumble upon the pretentiousness and piousness that ruins this boneless blockbuster. The film finally decides to stack on the combinations of boisterous match-ups involving everyone but the kitchen sink but all comes off as frivolously forced. Cavell was never really an enticing Superman ever since he donned the big “S” on his chest back in 2013’s** Man of Steel**. Affleck’s Batman is a little more palatable but the constant scowl (both on his face and on the mask) is too much to digest. One would not mind yelling at the screen for Affleck’s alter ego to lighten up a bit.\r\n\r\nThe supporting players are virtually wasted in this exhausting CGI popcorn pleaser. Eisenberg, normally a trustworthy performer with considerable scope, merely irritates as the punkish techno-magnate Luthor. The always radiant Adams is a wash as the gushing Lois Lane. Oscar-winner Jeremy Irons’s Alfred the butler won’t make anyone forget Micheal Caine’s take on Wayne’s trusty man servant anytime soon. Even the reliably adventurous Oscar-nominated actor Michael Shannon cannot exuberantly bring to life the menacing presence of Zod.\r\n\r\nHumorless and hackneyed, **Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice** will probably satisfy indiscriminate devoted fans that will buy into the proposed heralded rivalry. As for others, they will wonder what lies ahead in terms of other League of Justice movies that hopefully can muster up more entertaining stimulation than this over-indulgent doomsday dud. Is anyone up for **Wonder Woman vs. Redwing** with an empowering feminine twist?\r\n\r\n**Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice** (2016)\r\n\r\nWarner Bros.

  "content": "> Know your enemy's weakness before challenging to a fight!\r\n\r\nIt is known that critics have no brain. It is the best Superman film as Henry Cavill in the red and blue suit. Yep, I know it is always DC versus Marvel, so it is then DC's reply to the 'Avengers'. I don't care their rivalries, as a film fanatic, I enjoy good films and I found it was so good. But I was a bit worried after the Superman was shown in a dark shade in the trailer, especially after Batwan was overly stylised by Nolan, I thought the black suit would take over. After watching the film I was relieved and happy that Batman was exposed.\r\n\r\nBatman fans might have been disappointed, but for the superhero and DC fans, this film is a great treat. You can't compare it with 'Avengers', it had its own style. It follows the 'Man of Steel' and directed by the same director. Excellent cast. I have never been the Ben Affleck hater, so I had no objection to his role in this. He did good along with Cavill and others. He would do better in his solo Batman films if Zack Snyder is retained to script and direct them.\r\n\r\nI'm not a comic book reader, so I did not know the story before the watch. I was surprised for the Wonder Woman's part in the film. The visuals were awesome, the story was unpredictable, well developed characters, cleverly composed scenes, wonderful stunt sequences and the film's overall tone was kind of dark and gloomy, a very satisfying superhero film. The content balance was perfect, but the characters did not do the same as we know Superman is a father of all superheroes.\r\n\r\nI already watched it twice and I can't wait for its sequel. Especially looking forward for Jesse Eisenberg, because he was kind of stayed low in this and I hope his character Lex becomes much stronger. It is a PG13, and there's nothing botherable stuffs in it for the underage audience, but I felt it is targeted for adults because of the matured flavour. Don't think about that I said, just watch it, it will definitely entertain you well if not blow you away. Surely recommended to all.\r\n\r\n8/10",

  "content": "As I write this review I have just had a thoroughly disappointing movie experience and it so just happens that I have some strong feelings about the source material for this movie so be prepared for a bit of ranting and a few more “adult” words than usual.\r\n\r\nI have to say that I bought this movie only because I felt I wanted it in my collection just for it to be complete. I was really expecting to be, shall we say, not impressed. A movie about Batman and Superman, heroes that I grew up with, fighting is not my kind of movie.\r\n\r\nIn the end I realized that my expectations of crappines was not enough. I really disliked this movie. In short succession this movie turns several of my childhood heroes to bad guys and the greatest superman bad guy into a unstable hippie-like jerk that goes through the movie behaving like he is a drug addict. So basically this movie went drown the drains for me straight away and then I have not even gotten started about the plot. Actually I felt so annoyed over this crap that I actually spent time taking notes while I was watching.\r\n\r\nLet me see what I noted. Lex Luther is a fucking joke. Alfred, the same. Jimmy Olsen a fucking CIA agent? You got to be fucking kidding me! And not only does he screw Lois Lane but gets himself shot after a few seconds of screen time.\r\n\r\nSame stupid nonsense about XXX being too powerful, is a threat and needs to be government controlled that has been used in hundreds. if not thousands, of crappy low and high budget action movies. I hate that crap. It is stupid, stupid, stupid.\r\n\r\nWeird and totally uninteresting dream scenes, what the f... did the writer smoke? If they wanted to pad the movie it a) was a crappy way of doing it and b) why? With over three hours (Ultimate Edition) it is way to long for such a crappy movie anyway.\r\n\r\nOh, here is a (somewhat) positive note at least. It was indeed rather funny that they had chosen CNN to spew out the nonsense conspiracy theories about Superman being responsible for the bomb in the wheelchair. Fake news anyone?\r\n\r\nI had a little bit of enjoyment of the movie during the last part of the movie when it finally turned into a bit of action. Batman’s car and plane was cool. The action, once Batman getting knocked on his head enough to get to his senses again, was a nice chunk of CGI goodness. That I have to admit.\r\n\r\nOkay, after three, mostly painful, hours the movie finally comes to an end. And what an end. Meh!!! Not only was it a crappy ending but they managed to drag it out forever with excruciatingly boring scenes.\r\n\r\nI am sure a lot of the above can be said to be subjective. For instance my dislike of the way my childhood characters where treated. I am not a professional reviewer though so this is my personal take of the movie. If you don’t like it, fine with me and good for you but do not feel obliged to tell me about it.",

  "content": "Very short synopsis : Batman has been hit hard by the events of Man of Steel : a \"god\" descends on earth, is confronted by another god, and they fight, killing thousands of humans. He learns about a rock coming from his birth planet that can weaken or kill him. It's the property of Lex Luthor, who could target Superman too, but with evil purpose.\r\n\r\nSo I won't go deeper in the story. This movie, unlike most other superhero movie, is targeting adults. I don't mean 18 or 21 year old, I mean mature beings that have endured bad things in life, and have taken the time to see the goods and bads of humanity. Yes, not the Marvel (Guardians of the galaxy, Ant man) target audience. Batman makes it clear (rejoined by the senator) : if a being is so powerful he can't be killed and can kill thousands, even if for now he does good, what happens if he becomes a villain? What laws or weapons can stop him?\r\n\r\nNow going back to the movie and how it presents its argument. We have Batman's introduction to the new DC movie universe (death of parents, tortured psyche ...) done during the opening credits. That is both efficient and powerful. Then we see Bruce Wayne at the time of the Superman / Zod battle. We also see humans being scared and killed. So, yeah it's superhero movie making not showing merry world with superheroes saving humans. And doing funny quotes. It's people (or super people) facing tragedy and growing up to see how the future has to be settled. And then a new villain appears. Or rather, he appears as a careless billionnaire showing off - how could he be perceived as dangerous? He has the chance of having Batman wanting to take down Superman, when he wants the same thing, so he can go for his secondary plan to use Krypton technology to change the world.\r\n\r\nSo the last part of the movie is the fight of 3 super heroes against a creature created by the \"god\"'s technology and humanity's madness/evilness. Yes, it's not a villain that is there because you need one to fight the bad guys, it's yet another consequence of Kryptonians coming to earth.\r\n\r\nSo the films rolls out and I'm so stunned by the content I feel I was treated as a human being, not as a popcorn eating teenager or a comics fan. Just as someone that could appreciate great movie making.",

I think Zack Snyder crushed it with the incredible production design, off-the-charts casting, and gritty take on a lost and weary Batman. The casting for this movie is a master stroke of brilliance. Ben Affleck’s Batman is jaded and bitter, taking his rage and loss out on the criminal element of Gotham. His hulking physique emphasizes Batman’s imposing strength over his gadgets when in combat. Zack Snyder also gave us Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, which we all know is one of the best choices in the comic book cinema world. The fight sequences are the best part of BvS; pitting godlike power against a man motivated by grief somehow seems possible and brutal because of Snyder’s writing and directing. Finally, the world-building and teases bring so much intrigue and excitement for future films. It isn’t a perfect film, but as a DC and Batman fan, it is one of my favorite comic book movies and stands out as refreshingly separate from all the bright-colored goofy Marvel movies of the time.",

It is such an emotional film. The story of the HERO Desmond Doss is truly inspiring.Thank you Mel Gibson and Desmond Doss Jr. for letting us know more about this remarkable man. Hugo Weaving was robbed of an Oscar nomination. Andrew Garfield blew my away with his performance and it is Vince Vaughn's best performance as well. It is the best film of 2016.",

  "content": "**On the battlefront, his intention was to save the lives.**\r\n\r\nThe film was awesome, mainly because of the good message it carried out. That's not it, the film was well made with the wonderful cast and their great performances. The special effects were top notch, as well as the location where the majority of the second half takes place. This is a US-Australian co-production. Mel Gibson returned to the director's chair with a bang after exactly a decade. It got six Oscars nominees, so let's wait and see how many awards it grabs.\r\n\r\nIt was the World War II theme, based on a real person and events. It tells the story of an American youngster named Desmond Doss, who joins the army to contribute to his nation. But for his religious point of view, he struggles during the training. After managing to make through, the remaining film focused to reveal his bravery on the battlefield against the Japanese armed forces at Okinawa in a place called Hacsaw Ridge.\r\n\r\nThe story was based on one of the ten commandments. Doss, who strongly believes in that carries the same ideology to the combat zone. But all the initial part of the film reflects why he is very on to it. Especially after a fight with his brother in his childhood, followed by saving a severely injured man in a road accident just before deciding to join the army. So it is like both, a war film, as well as an anti-war theme. Most importantly, it tells us the bravery of a man, like of something Gandhi in the battlefield.\r\n\r\nHe did it in what he had believed, but my perspective differs. I liked the film, as a biopic and the message it delivered. Very entertaining too, but when it comes to Doss' belief, I think it was flawed. In the first place he would have not joined the army if he's true to the commandment. That's the basic rule of the commandment if one wants to adopt it.\r\n\r\nHe was just one of the unique person with such idea and luckily succeeded following it in a hostile situation. Only if you think all his episodes from an atheist perspective, that's how you would feel. One of the major reasons for that is, when he saves his men by letting his enemy die. But appreciable effort, at least from the Americans perspective. A true hero for his nation. One of the best war films ever. Instead of saying a must see film, I would say don't miss it.\r\n\r\n_7.5/10_",

It is based on the 2004 documentary The Conscientious Objector. It stars Andrew Garfield, Sam Worthington, Vince Vaughn, Luke Bracey, Teresa Palmer, Ryan Corr, Hugo Weaving and Rachel Griffiths. Music is by Rupert Gregson-Williams and cinematography by Simon Duggan.\r\n\r\nFilm is a depiction of the real life heroics of Desmond Doss, an American pacifist combat medic in WWII during The Battle of Okinawa.\r\n\r\nHow great to have Gibson back directing, more so when he's tackling the brutalities of war and the critical human interest stories within. The story of Desmond Doss is inspirational stuff and Gibson and his team have done his story proud. \r\n\r\nFirst half of the picture details Doss' upbringing, getting to know his family background, his beliefs and the forming of his loving relationship with Dorothy Schutte. Then after Pearl Harbour he enlists in service and we are then witness to boot camp, which comes with the horrors of bullying and ostracization due to Doss refusing to even touch a rifle - let alone use one! After the military based political thunder has exhausted its armoury, Doss and the rest of the 77th Infantry Division are sent to Okinawa to try and capture the Maeda Escarpment (Hacksaw Ridge). From where a true legend is born.\r\n\r\nAs is a Gibson trademark, the battle scenes are terrifyingly real and bloody as can be, the horrors of war laid bare for dramatic impact. Amongst the carnage, which is magnificently framed in smoky hazes and a landscape obliterated by weaponry, Doss (brilliantly brought to life by Garfield) comes to the fore. From within the madness comes humanity in its purest and most genuine form, and it makes for edge of the seat viewing whilst stirring the blood of those invested fully in this remarkable story. 9/10",

  "content": "***Tribute to a real-life WW2 “conscientious collaborator”*** \r\n\r\nAfter Pearl Harbor, Desmond Doss of Lynchburg, Virginia, joins the US Army to become a medic and serves at the Battle of Okinawa. As a Seventh Day Adventist and conscientious objector, his goal was to save lives, not kill, which naturally causes problems with his fellow soldiers; until they observe his bravery in combat. Teresa Palmer is on hand as Doss’ potential babe while Vince Vaughn plays the drill sergeant. \r\n\r\nBased on a true story and directed by Mel Gibson, \"Hacksaw Ridge\" (2016) is a reverent and compelling WW2 flick that includes the usual training sequences in the first half balanced by intense combat sequences in the second. The unique factor here is that the brave protagonist refuses to use a weapon and is determined to only save lives in the midst of the insanity of war. This is an interesting real-life tale that needs to be told and “Hacksaw Ridge” is a good war movie only marred by laying on the heroics too thick as well as the lack of depth in the peripheral characters, which makes them uninteresting. The latter is in contrast to the outstanding “Platoon” (1986) which featured several well-defined characters.\r\n\r\nThe movie’s about an individual who believes in ABSOLUTE pacifism, which is a peaceable attitude that refuses to ever turn to violence, even in response to evil or for the purpose of national defense. He thinks this is supported by the Bible and, specifically, the New Testament, but it isn’t. The Scriptures support LIMITED pacifism, which is a peaceable attitude that only resorts to violence when justified. Christ' instructions to \"turn the cheek\" related to responding to a backhanded slap to the face, which was an insult in that culture. In other words, we could all save ourselves a lot of trouble in life if we learn to ignore the antagonism of various morons who would like to divert our focus and ruin our day. The Old Testament teaches this as well: \"A fool shows his annoyance at once, but a prudent man overlooks an insult\" (Proverbs 12:16). So Christ was talking about giving an antagonist a break for the sake of peace in situations of personal offense; he wasn't referring to cases of severe criminal acts or defense of one’s nation. \r\n\r\nFor proof, Jesus' ministry team had a treasury box and some of his workers carried swords for protection from thieves/murderers in their travels. You see, Christ & his disciples weren’t absolute pacifists. On two occasions, the Messiah got a whip out and chased all the fools out of the Temple – throwing over tables, swinging the whip and yelling. He was a Holy Terror, pure & simple, and this caused the legalistic religious leaders to fear him and plot murder (Mark 11:15-18). Harmless pacifists don't inspire fear and provoke murder plots. Moreover, Romans 13 clearly states that the righteous laws of human governments are ordained of God for the purpose of punishing criminals, domestic & foreign, who threaten the lives of citizens. This includes the right to execute when appropriate. The majority of sane Christians realize this, but there are a few extremists, like Doss in the movie, who refuse to be balanced with the Scriptures on this matter and insist that violent conflict is never appropriate. They’re wrong. Sometimes it’s necessary, like after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, unprovoked, murdering over 2300 innocents and wounding 1100.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hour, 19 minutes, and was shot in New South Wales, Australia.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-",

  "content": "**A really good movie, which only lacks in some details.**\r\n\r\nThis was not the first war film directed by Mel Gibson. He had previously made at least one military-themed film, “We Were Soldiers”, set in Vietnam. However, it is a film that addresses much more human and intimate themes, in my opinion, by following the Doss family, a family from rural Virginia, and the trajectory of one of their children, Desmond.\r\n\r\nSon of an extraordinarily devout mother, raised an Adventist, Desmond learns as a child to deny violence (the film shows a fight between brothers that could have ended very badly, but in real life it was a fight between Desmond's father and his brother-in-law) and to strictly follow his faith and religion. When the US joins the Allies in World War II, the brothers decide to enlist, but Desmond insists on doing so on his own terms, that is, as a combat rescuer, exempt from the use and carrying of any weapon. Of course, the US military isn't going to take this in the best light.\r\n\r\nThe film exposes itself in a somewhat lengthy way and captures our sympathy very well, but despite many people complaining that the first part of the film is slow and tiring, I felt this more in the prolonged combat scenes, despite understanding what led Gibson to detail them so exhaustively. Still, it is necessary to be frank: they are excellent battle scenes, with rich details and a very accentuated degree of rawness. Unfortunately, the dialogues aren't very good, they sound a bit cliché, and it's annoying to see that in a movie with so many qualities. The film also makes efforts to create a romantic subplot around Desmond's first wife, but things don't go well, and the material is frankly poor.\r\n\r\nIn general, Gibson does a good job of directing, although that won't come as a surprise to the most attentive observer. He already has a number of hits in his filmography and, together with Clint Eastwood and Bradley Cooper, is one of the actors I most like to see in the director's chair. Until now, I never really considered the value of the actors involved in this project. Some I just don't know very well. Andrew Garfield is an example: I've seen him in other works, but the actor never completely convinced me, so I was very impressed with his work here. Sam Worthington also impressed me very well, although he's an actor I recognize more easily, and I've seen him work well in other films. Hugo Weaving is excellent, and Vince Vaughn also deserves praise. Only Teresa Palmer seems to have more difficulty to disentangling herself from the work at hand, perhaps due to the weak material received.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film has a lot of good things to look at, starting with the reasonably rigorous way in which Gibson seeks to re-enact the combat and war environment, from the recruiting camp to the field. Unlike many films from his past, where the director trampled on historical truth, he seems to make sincere efforts to respect it here. The visual and special effects are really very good, and the CGI used is truly excellent and gives the film a remarkable realism, especially in the combat scenes. The sets are interesting and the costumes too. I especially liked the old uniform that Weaving wears in a brief scene, given the difference with the uniforms in use at the time. The cinematography takes advantage of all this and more, and the camera moves intelligently, putting us in the fight, making us suffer with those soldiers, and feel what they felt, what Gregson's soundtrack -Williams accentuates even more.",

  "content": "Andrew Garfield turns in a strong performance here as a true-life conscientious objector during WWII who refused to bear arms but who was equally determined to play his part as an army medic. He portrays Desmond Doss, a devout Christian who endures dog’s abuse from his colleagues at boot camp after he accepts the draft but avails himself of a much derided get-out clause regarding avoiding rifles! The scorn he suffers, the violence and resentment he is subjected to doesn’t deter him from completing the course - even to the point when a court martial looms over his head. What is clear from the outset is that he isn’t remotely cowardly, and as he finally sets off to a particularly gruesome theatre of war at the very aptly named “Hacksaw Ridge” he has an opportunity to prove to everyone, including himself, whether he has what it takes. The history robs the film of much in the way of jeopardy, but it also means we don’t have to spend ages building up characters and plot lines, so we can capitalise of this emotive effort from Garfield, as well as a more delicate one from Hugo Weaving as his Great War veteran dad, and from a plethora of powerful supporting roles whilst Mel Gibson, Simon Duggan and Barry Robison plonk us into the middle of a series of scenarios that wreak of authenticity, dirt, grime, mud, blood and shrapnel whilst extolling the virtues and shaming the bigotry that armed conflict presents towards people who are, for what ever reason, less compliant with the accepted rules of the army. As war films go, this ranks amongst the most convincing to watch imbuing a genuine sense of peril and of the true ghastliness of war and courage of not just Doss, here, but of those who fought with weapons more deadly than a backpack full of bandages and opiates. Big screen is best for the full effect of the photography, if you can, but even on a television this is a compellingly told story of a man on a mission that’s well though-provoking on a number of levels and well worth a watch.",

Taken under the wing of The League Of Shadows, a deadly ninja assassin army devoted to erasing crime with their own brand of harsh justice. After completing training, Wayne refuses to join them on account of not agreeing with their methods, he returns to Gotham City to reek his own one man war against crime.\r\n\r\nDirector Christopher Nolan literally goes back to Batman origins to not just give the dead franchise a kiss of life, but actually to spark it into a sort of triumphant homecoming. Gone is all forms of camp veneer so evident in Joel Schumacher's offerings, and in place we have a darkly rich picture intent on fleshing out Batman's motives, and crucially, his fractured persona.\r\n\r\nOne of the most pleasing things to me was that Nolan paced this picture to perfection, the build up of character, and then birth of the Bat, dominates for practically the first hour of the piece. This gives Batman Begins some crucial heart, it really helps us to focus on this weird super-hero now that we have some meat on his bones. We then follow Wayne from a Chinese prison to The League Of Shadows monastery, watching his transformation from brawling man of anger into a controlled fighting machine. A machine that still roams with a revenge laden heart.\r\n\r\nThen its to Gotham City where he then births Batman and all bad guys are on his agenda. Mob boss Falcone, the mysterious Scarecrow, and also a face from his past that rears its surprising head. Wayne is driven by powerful motives, and it's here in the second part of the film that Batman Begins rewards those who indulged in the character build up. In come the stunts and outrageous sequences, all played out in Nolan's desperately dank Gotham City (a far cry from Tim Burton's dark Oz like scapes). This Gotham is pot boiling to disaster and is crying out for the Bat to sweep all before it, and thankfully Nolan and his cast fulfil all the early promise to deliver a wonderful action fantasy that caters for all ages.\r\n\r\nChristian Bale dons the Batsuit and it fits like a glove, his Bruce Wayne may lack the ebullient charisma that Michael Keaton's had, but his Batman is mean and moody and comfortable with the zippy dialogue. Michael Caine plays Alfred the loyal servant to the Wayne family, much heart and emotive drive from Caine ensures the role is a roaring success. Cillian Murphy is Dr Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow who actually scares more as Crane with his piercing eyes and devilishly smirky leer, whilst both Gary Oldman (Jim Gordon) & Morgan Freeman (Lucius Fox) are solid with what little they actually have to do. Liam Neeson gets his teeth into a meaty role as Henri Ducard, and as a character arc he gets the best scenes (Nolan clearly having great fun here).\r\n\r\nMinnor let downs to me without hurting the picture are Katie Holmes (pretty but hardly convincing as Assistant D.A. Rachael Dawes) and Rutger Hauer as Earle (a little bit of menace wouldn't go amiss here Rutger old man). Still, as I said they are very minor let downs because as comic book adaptations go, Batman Begins is from the top draw, a franchise re-suited, rebooted and completely reinvigorated. But now the test comes with that all important sequel... 9/10",

Admittedly like many others, even though this is the first entry in the Dark Knight Trilogy, I watched it is as my last one, and that is due to me not even knowing of it's existence, which is thanks to it being heavily overshadowed by the critically acclaimed sequel, \"The Dark Knight.\"\r\n\r\nBatman Begins has a simple plot to follow full of twists. A young Bruce Wayne travels to the Far East, where he's trained in the martial arts by Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), a member of the mysterious League of Shadows. Ducard later reveals the true purpose of the League, the complete destruction of Gotham City as they feel it is an unjust cesspool full of criminals that is too far gone to be saved and must be cleansed to preserve their duty and for justice and balance to be restored. Bruce does not agree with the League's morals and returns to Gotham on his own determined to clean up the crime-ridden and corrupted city without resorting to murder. With the help of his loyal butler Alfred (Michael Caine) and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), a tech expert at Wayne Enterprises, Batman is born.\r\n\r\nThe number one takeaway from this film that I did not experience as much in any other Batman movie, was that it really makes you care and feel compassion towards Bruce Wayne himself, not the masked vigilante he disguises himself as. The real Bruce is tragic, realistic, relatable, quite unstable, and frankly doesn't know what his purpose is or what he should be doing with himself. This is the origin story, and you get to first hand see the traumatic events that turned him into the lonely, guilt ridden bitter man you see today. His feelings and actions are completely justified, and I've gained a lot of respect for the character.\r\n\r\nNow this is a dark, gritty and mature film clearly made for adult fans, do not expect the colorful, campy comic book styled \"Joel Schumacher\" treatment here, this is going to get real, real fast. I can and do appreciate the attempt to not be a generic superhero film and head towards the crime drama genre, and don't get me wrong it's a great movie, but there a few issues that keep it from being perfect movie status like the sequel in my books. It was maybe a bit too serious for it's own good, and ends up being so focused on becoming an art piece that it almost stops being fun. Primary antagonist Ra's al Ghul is great, but secondary villain Dr. Crane a.k.a. Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy) has an apparent lack of quality visual effects and proper screen time. The long run time was not wasted, but they probably did not need to include so many side characters, world building and lore into what could have been a quicker, neat, well done origin story.\r\n\r\nOverall I liked and can get behind Batman Begins, I do not think it's the best in the \"Dark Knight Trilogy,\" but it's a top quality film on it's own accord especially if I stop comparing too much. This film delivers a uniquely cold, cruel, and memorable experience that will make you see and appreciate Bruce Wayne and his Batman persona from a completely new perspective.",

It's when he encounters \"Ducard\" (Liam Neeson) and is lured high into the Himalayan mountains that he is set to training by the legendary Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe) so that he can join the \"League of Shadows\" - an uniquely skilled ninja-esque group of elite warriors. He plans to use his training to return to the largely lawless Gotham City and act as a force for good. Soon, though, he learns that all in his highland sanctuary is not what it seems and after a battle royale, finds himself back at his manor house with his faithful retainer \"Alfred\" (Sir Michael Caine) and at the helm of his company - just as it is about to be sold by \"Earle\" (Rutger Hauer) making him an even more immensely wealthy man. His scientific guru - a sort of equivalent of \"Q\" - is \"Lucius Fox\" (Morgan Freeman) and together with the like-minded police officer \"Gordon\" (Gary Oldman) they set about taking down the city's kingpin \"Falcone\" (Tom Wilkinson) before he can contaminate the water supply with an opiate that will bring wholesale fear and destruction. This is a cracking action adventure film that rarely has a dull moment. Nolan and accomplished writer David S. Goyer take this character by the scruff of the neck and it really works. No more silly thwacks and pows; this is a dark and gritty tale of corruption, jealousy and revenge that is superbly photographed and has gadgets galore. I did struggle with Wilkinson, to be honest - he has all the menace of a wet cabbage; and Katie Holmes's \"Rachel\", though providing additional humanity, sadly offers little as this plots twists and turns like a cobra on steroids. Certainly never my favourite super-hero, \"Batman\", but this is certainly up there as one of my favourite superhero films. No laser eyes or magnetic powers; just a decent man with vengeance on his mind.",

  "content": "**Batman Begins opened the door for the new age of superhero cinema with its realistic, grounded approach and excellent quality.**\r\n\r\nMany may not realize the groundbreaking impact Batman Begins had on the superhero genre. While Spider-man and X-Men were popular films, many still rejected comic book films as only for kids. Incredibly cheesy films like Catwoman and Batman + Robin didn’t help make the more grown-up audiences have much faith in the genre. But Batman Begins changed all that. Batman was stripped of all the goofy comic book shtick and thrust into a gritty real world that spent time developing the character and making a rich man dressed like a bat and jumping off of buildings suddenly seem not just possible but awesome. Nolan’s serious and dark aesthetics and tone changed the landscape of superhero films and paved the way for the soon-to-come Marvel universe. With a brilliant director like Christopher Nolan and a cast boasting Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman, the film carried a weight and quality that was new and fresh for comic book films and signaled the beginning of a new era for superhero movies.",

  "content": "<em>'Flight Risk'</em> is a film that I'm not totally convinced by, though in the end I think I like it. On the one hand, it has inconsistent suspense, has dodgy humour and doesn't truly entertain like an action thriller ought to. On the other hand, the performances are good, the exterior plane shots are convincing and the twisty nature makes it watchable.\r\n\r\nMark Wahlberg (amusing accent), Michelle Dockery and Topher Grace are actors that I enjoyed watching here, Grace manages to overcome some cringey dialogue that was (hopefully, for his sake) written for him; the banter isn't great, the more serious stuff he is solid at. Monib Abhat also has iffy comedy, though does make it work more; a mostly voice role helps.\r\n\r\nOverall, a fine time at the movies. Like last week, I was fortunately able to watch it as part of a double header on the big screen - this time with Steven Soderbergh's <em>'Presence'</em>. Back-to-back 90 minutes, I'm cool with long run times but sometimes its nice to have films of such a length. For what it's worth, that other flick is the better.",

The first few shots in the cabin pull you in, and the takeoff sequence gives some nice scenic visuals. But once the plane gets in the air, the movie loses its edge. The direction is competent but lacks any real flair, shifting into a standard back-and-forth between characters that makes everything feel predictable. The plot tries to build tension with espionage and intrigue, but it never fully develops. There are a lot of questionable decisions made by the characters, and the script doesn’t do much to make them feel believable.\r\n\r\nMark Wahlberg delivers a solid performance, holding his character well, but the supporting cast doesn’t bring much to the table. The CGI is a weak point, especially considering how much the movie relies on it. With most of the story taking place inside the plane, you'd expect at least the exterior shots to be convincing, but they aren't. The action sequences feel choppy, and some moments defy logic in ways that take you out of the experience. The score is there, but nothing stands out. Overall, Flight Risk had potential but ends up being an average thriller that leans too much on familiar tropes without adding anything new.",

The pacing is just as dreadful, with lifeless, generic interactions dragging between absurd fight sequences. In addition to the unthinkable level of suspension of disbelief, the cast is also unable to improve the appalling material.\r\n\r\nTopher Grace delivers an awful performance, while Michelle Dockery and Mark Wahlberg - who admittedly commits to his lunatic role - can't escape the movie's overwhelming ridiculousness.

It’s epic, ambitious, crazy, witty and unafraid to go for the heart as well as the throat. As a whole, this adaptation of maybe Stephen King’s greatest work feels singular in the landscape of modern horror cinema: two films built on strong interconnected relationships spread over decades, as sentimental as they are vicious, and executed on the scale of a fantasy epic. They also may be amongst the best adaptations of King’s work, understanding what makes his writing (and this novel in particular) so horrifying and so arresting, the human horror amongst the fantastical.

  "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nSo, Chapter Two is a sequel to It (2017), and my expectations were a bit high. I really enjoyed the latter to the point of considering it one of the year’s best, as well as one of the best Stephen King cinematic adaptations. Andy Muschietti returning to the director’s chair and having such a fantastic cast portraying the adult versions of the Losers (not only in terms of quality acting but also regarding how well the adults look like the older versions of the young actors) are two of the main reasons why I was genuinely excited. Also, the runtime (longest horror movie ever?!) definitely left me wondering how a horror flick could have the same duration of some of the most epic films in cinema…\r\n\r\nWell, I got to be honest: I’m disappointed. It’s not a bad movie, at all, but it doesn’t even come close to its predecessor’s heels. I disagree with some headlines I’ve read though. Some say the comedy was misplaced, taking away impact from emotional or dark moments. There’s barely a moment where it was expected seriousness and laughter kicked in instead, but when it does occur, it actually works. I just think it wasn’t as funny as the previous film, overall. Granted, Bill Hader as Richie Tozier is hilarious, and a perfect cast as an adult Finn Wolfhard. His chemistry with James Ransone (Eddie Kaspbrak) resembles the one Wolfhard, and Jack Dylan Grazer had, therefore this/these duo(s) being the comedy highlight.\r\n\r\nSome say the movie is too long. Now, this is a tricky one. Usually, when people feel bored or not as entertained as they wanted to be, they tend to blame it on the film’s runtime, especially if it’s over 100 minutes. I agree that the movie FEELS long, but I disagree that the runtime is too long. There’s more than enough story to explore, and literally, every single character from the Losers Club has an interesting arc. The problem here is that not all of them are explored in a way that’s funny, scary, or just captivating enough. The fact that Jessica Chastain’s (Beverly Marsh) sequence with the old lady is entirely displayed in one of the trailers (and consequently shown at every single screening) doesn’t help the pacing.\r\n\r\nThe first act is pretty decent. As expected, it shows us where everyone is, what they’re doing for a living, and how they get back together. During this act, it’s pretty clear that Muschietti is going to give time to develop each character and follow their respective arcs to the end, hence the lengthy runtime. However, the second act falls flat. Bill Denbrough (James McAvoy / Jaeden Martell) has the most emotionally impactful storyline, one that affects the main plot, making the time that is spent with him worth it. Same goes for Richie’s subplot. On the opposite side, the rest of the group doesn’t have entertaining sequences or new developments whatsoever.\r\n\r\nBeverly continues to be affected by her childhood of abuse from her father. Ben Hanscom (Jay Ryan / Jeremy Ray Taylor) keeps being in love with Bev. Eddie is still a whiny little “kid” who’s scared of everything that might make him ill. Stanley Uris (Andy Bean / Wyatt Oleff) doesn’t do anything, and Mike Hanlon is surprisingly the engine that moves the plot forward, which is a problem of its own since I never really cared for that character (he was definitely the one put aside in the 2017’s movie). Honestly, he just serves as an exposition device considering he spends the whole time just explaining everything the audience needs to know to understand where the film is going.\r\n\r\nFinally, the third act is a mixed bag. While it does provide a climactic ending with a sweet message, it feels very much like its predecessor. I don’t want to spoil anything, but it’s incredibly repetitive comparing to the first movie. Considering all things together, it’s a big letdown since it feels like the exact same film, but with older versions of the characters. Obviously, each of them has a different arc in this one, something the first didn’t have the time to explore, but looking at the main story, it’s pretty much the exact same thing, including how it ends (just with a minor twitch). Nevertheless, the performances are all great… \r\n\r\nJames McAvoy continues his streak of amazing displays, and Bill Hader has to be the MVP for the range he demonstrates. I wish Skarsgård had more time to shine as Pennywise, though. In 2017, I thought he really nailed the character and made it his own. Unfortunately, this time around, Pennywise doesn’t have that much screentime (such a disappointment), and when it appears, it often looks too CGI-ish, taking away from the gripping performance of its actor. The finale has almost no Bill Skarsgård since there’s so much CGI. Despite that, I congratulate the team(s) behind the makeup, hairstyling, costume, and production design. Derry looks terrific, and the time jumps between the young and the old gang worked seamlessly partially due to these visual achievements.\r\n\r\nAndy Muschietti knows how to work a camera, and the movie is very well-shot. However, he should have been able to come up with creative sequences to deliver a different level of entertainment, especially during the tiresome second act. Gary Dauberman’s screenplay is clever, and it brings this enormous story to a fitting conclusion, but he also could have imagined some new ideas for some of the characters. There are a couple of great sequences though, especially one with Bill going through a theme park tent with illusions. \r\n\r\nIn the end, It Chapter Two fails to deliver a conclusion worthy of its epic runtime. Even with a phenomenal cast, it isn’t as funny, as scary or even as captivating as its predecessor. Its runtime is appropriated having in mind that each character has a personal arc, but only a couple of them are genuinely compelling and entertaining. Therefore, the film feels too long, uneven, and it could have used a bit more creativity when it comes to its climactic finale. Its central story feels very similar to the last movie, its scary sequences are nowhere near the quality seen before, and even though the costume and production design are top-notch, there’s excessive use of CGI on Pennywise. It still carries some emotionally convincing moments, as well as a couple of cool sequences. Overall, it’s … okay.\r\n\r\nRating: C",

  "content": "“You lied and I died!”\r\n\r\nMaking us proud Georgie.\r\n\r\nI re-watched the 1990 mini-series and 2017 remake last month in preparation for this movie in terms of judging in quality. The 90's version had it moments, but I find some scenes unintentionally funny where it reeked of early Stephen King adaptations. 2017 was surprisingly good and a massive improvement, but laid back on cheap thrills.\r\n\r\n‘IT: Chapter Two’ was a tough act to follow up on after the monster success of the first and with the second chapter being the hardest to adapt. I thought the movie both succeeds and stumbles in parts. Although reflecting back makes it feel more like a parody than a serious horror movie. An epic finale that ended in a over the top fashion - with themes of childhood trauma and the idea of holding on to the past despite growing up with age are sprinkled through out. The loser club are all grown up now and returning home to kill IT.\r\n\r\nWhoever cast the grow up version of the loser club deserves massive praise here, because it’s pitch perfect casting and I could definitely see the child stars growing up to be the adult stars. James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, Jay Ryan, and Isaiah Mustafa were all great in bringing the more dramatic aspects to the film. While Bill Hader and James Ranson bring the comedic aspects, but not to say they weren't dramatic as well, even making me tear up at one point.\r\n\r\nBill Skarsgard was truly amazing as Pennywise. The physicality in his movement has a certain silliness that you would expect to see from a clown, yet predatory with his animal-like attacks with drool running down his mouth and eyes staring in opposite directions despite looking straight at you. I find the dancing clown incredibly terrifying whenever he becomes playful and kind to deceive children.\r\n\r\nAndy Muschietti truly shines as a director when it comes to bizarre imagery and unsettling camera angles, while also capturing some real emotions through the lens. The opening scene at the bridge where a homophobic attack takes place was really brutal and starts the movie off strong - on par with the Georgie meets Pennywise scene in the first movie.\r\n\r\nDespite the run time being nearly three hours long, but I can’t recall ever being bored. It moved at a even pace in my opinion. I guess a few scenes could’ve been cut as most of it is unused footage from the first movie. Although it would be difficult to cut scenes as everything follows up to the next scene and that emotional punch towards the end wouldn’t be earned.\r\n\r\nNow for the issues:\r\n\r\nHenry Bowers was completely pointless in this movie and was only used for jump scars. Same thing with Mike, who through out these movies has nothing to do and the important things he did in the book was given to different characters.\r\n\r\nI didn’t like how Stan’s suicide was handle, because you find out he actually “sacrificed” himself to save the others.\r\n\r\nSome of the humor didn’t always land, especially if it’s right after a tense scene where it kinda deflates the horror. At times I struggled to gasp what the film marker was going for in certain scenes. Is this scene suppose to be scary or funny? Both maybe?\r\n\r\nI wish there was more practical work for the monster scenes instead of CGI, because at times it looked really terrible. The finale battle at the end could’ve been in a video game boss fight.\r\n\r\n* Overall rating: Not as strong as the first, but still enjoyed it. Still, let’s kill this f**king clown.**strong text**",

However, it regains its footing with an entertaining ending. I'm usually not a fan of cast changes in film series, but this does it to good effect. I love the characters, whether it be in this film or the preceding entry.\r\n\r\nJessica Chastain and Bill Hader are great choices to play the older versions of Sophia Lillis and Finn Wolfhard, they are very convincing casts. James McAvoy is also a positive addition, while Bill Skarsgård remains enjoyable as It.\r\n\r\nThe score is, again, strong. I like the plot, even if I do feel like it's stretched out and could've had more freshness added to it. It isn't as creepy as the first film either, but still has a solid amount of uneasiness.",

  "content": "<b>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is the perfect farewell to this quirky group of rogues we never expected to love so much.</b>\r\n\r\nOur faith in the Marvel Cinematic Universe waned throughout Phase 4 with films that felt hollow, rushed, and insincere. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 rekindled my hope as James Gunn and the cast’s love and passion for these characters shined in every moment of this beautiful, heartfelt send-off. Gunn reminded us of the magic of comic book movies when the storyteller cares more about the characters than the box office. Chris Pratt, Bradley Cooper, Karen Gillan, Dave Bautista, and the rest of the cast pour themselves into entertaining and genuine performances. This film is surprisingly emotional and had me wondering how they convinced me to care so deeply about such a zany group of goofballs, but that they did. Vol. 3 is one of the best conclusions to a film trilogy that had me leave the theater full of satisfaction and nostalgia. While Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is wonderful in nearly every way, if I had a complaint, it would be the soundtrack felt forced at times rather than complimenting strong moments in the first film. The villain wasn’t exceptional but was better than the average Marvel villain, and honestly, Vol. 3 wasn’t about the villain or battles as much as it was a farewell to a family of heroes we have all come to love. This movie is well worth your time, and the fantastic effects and cinematography warrant a trip to the cinema to enjoy it to its fullest! MCU doubters need to set aside their skepticism and enjoy saying goodbye to these beloved characters with this outstanding film.",

The High Evolutionary's character was unforgiving and brilliant in the context of the story. The screenplay never dissapoints and keeps you engaged even with its long runtime of 150mins.

  "content": "What a disappointment! The first one was great fun, the second almost as good , but this film is just a poor cousin that really struggles from a weak storyline that never really gets going. The megalomaniacal \"High Evolutionary\" (Chikwudi Iwuji) has set his sights on retrieving \"Rocket\" after having discovered that our feisty raccoon is a product of sophisticated genetic engineering - and that has enabled him to think and grow as a being; a skill that is hugely valuable to this global-scale cloner. Snag is, \"Rocket\" has been laid low after a rather violent visit from \"Warlock\" (Will Poulter) who is working with his mother to apprehend our ursine pal. \"Quill\" (Chris Pratt) and the others have determined to save him, though, and are soon on the trail of his origins and of a special pass key that could reset him and get him back to fighting fitness. Can the \"Guardians\" put aside their petty differences and unite before it's all too late? This is far too long and it also tries to involve all of the characters in such a fashion as to leave the whole thing with a rather superficial feel to it. Pratt actually features quite sparingly, and that robbed this of much of it's humour and punchiness. The visual effects are great, but that's nothing remarkable with Marvel - they are vivid and colourful but that's no substitute for a well written and characterful narrative that this film simply lacks. It does quite feature quite an engagingly eclectic soundtrack, but the rest of this is terribly unremarkable fayre that I found my self struggling to stay interested in as it meandered more into a realm of sci-fi sentimentality that ensured a minimum of jeopardy in a denouement that featured a fair degree of ham - especially from Iwuji. If this is to be the final instalment, then I fear it will not be one that I will ever bother to watch again. Pity.",

Slapstick at best and mostly just annoying. Certainly not very funny a lot of the time. Sure occasionally I did laugh but that was about one out of three times.\r\n\r\nAnd do not get me started about Quill. He’s a stupid, unfunny jerk. He so drags down these movies.\r\n\r\nThe movie does deliver when it comes to one very important aspect of superhero movies though and this is of course the action and special effects. I really liked them and most of my enjoyment of this movie came from this.\r\n\r\nThe story is actually quite okay though and it was kind of cool to get the story about Rocket.\r\n\r\nThe bad guy, well, he is really one of the best parts of this movie. Finally they managed to put together a real bonafide, megalomaniac, psychopathic and genocidal bad guy with lots of (bad) charisma.\r\n\r\nEven if he, despite being a genius in creating all kinds of biological creations, including new species, could not fix his own face instead of wearing a silly latex mask. Seriously? That just the usual dumbass Hollywood script writing.\r\n\r\nOverall though, this was a fun, special effects loaded, action roller coaster and, surprisingly enough when it comes to Marvel, not loaded with woke preaching.\r\n\r\nAnd it was cool to see Sylvester Stallone again even if it was just briefly.\r\n\r\nIf they had toned down the silliness, or gotten someone intelligent to write the jokes, it would have gotten another star from me.",

Plenty of seriousness doesn't stop the humour though, of which there is - as one would expect - plenty... that carrot face gag actually got me most.\r\n\r\nThe cast/characters are such a ragtag team, on paper I don't actually think they all fit together perfectly but in actuality it is a great bunch to follow. As for newcomers elsewhere in the film, Chukwudi Iwuji puts in a strong showing; I enjoyed him in <em>'Peacemaker'</em> so good to see him further here.\r\n\r\nAll round, a thoroughly entertaining movie and a fitting wrap up... to this set of Guardians, at least.",

Chris Pratt's portrayal of Star-Lord was a fantastic choice, and the characters like Rocket and Groot became instant fan favorites, with merchandise flying off the shelves. While Nebula's transformation from antihero to hero was well-received, Gamora felt underutilized. Drax provided comic relief, but off-screen controversies involving the actor can affect viewers' perception of the character. Overall, the movie is enjoyable and worth watching.\r\n\r\nVolume 2: While some may prefer the first installment, Volume 2 offers a deeper dive into the characters and more excitement. The film is wonderfully executed, providing a fantastic adventure that is highly recommended for its magical space journey and character development.\r\n\r\nVolume 3: This installment returns to the original concept of Marvel, seamlessly connecting with other films in the MCU. The movie offers fantastic character development, ensuring each character shines without overshadowing the others. Star-Lord and Gamora remain central, but the film also explores Rocket's origin story exceptionally well. The ensemble cast, including Mantis, Nebula, Groot, and Drax, deliver standout performances. New additions like Cosmo and Blurp add charm, while Adam Warlock's portrayal, though slightly disappointing, is explained within the storyline. The film is emotional, with impactful end credit scenes, making it a must-watch in theaters.\r\n\r\nHoliday Special: The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special is an exciting and enjoyable addition to the franchise, offering a fun and engaging viewing experience. The special presentation is a delightful continuation of the characters' stories, making them more relatable and adding an extra layer of excitement to the Marvel universe. This special is a testament to the franchise's creativity and is a welcome addition to the MCU continuity.",

  "content": "If you enjoy reading my reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nFirst of all, this is (obviously) a SPOILER review. I mean, who hasn’t seen this movie yet? If by some extraordinary circumstances you’re one of those unlucky souls, stop. Spend the next hour and a half watching this animated masterpiece and come back here. I will still avoid mentioning key details because I’m just used to it, and The Lion King has so many things to compliment that I don’t really need to get in-depth on spoilers. So, in case you haven’t notice it through my Twitter or occasional mentions in other reviews, The Lion King is one of my favorite films of all-time (animated or not)!\r\n\r\nI rewatched it for the 312358th time this last weekend, and I cried more than when I was just a child. That’s how much this movie means to me. The sense of nostalgia plus the overwhelming emotions throughout the runtime are tear-inducing aspects that I can’t simply avoid. I literally cried (waterfalls) in four (!) different scenes. The opening sequence (Circle of Life) filled my eyes with nostalgia’s tears. Mufasa’s tragic moment obviously wrecked me (one of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the history of cinema). Simba receiving the whole “remember who you are” speech from Mufasa in the clouds is incredibly inspirational and therefore worthy of some sobbing. Finally, one of the last scenes, Simba climbing his way to the top of Pride Rock with Hans Zimmer‘s score, leaving me absolutely destroyed.\r\n\r\nAnd I want to pick up on that last aspect: the score. It’s one of the most crucial technical features of a film, in my opinion. It can transform an “okay” scene into something magical or something pretty terrible, depending on what kind of score it is. Consequently, it can make a “good” movie turn into a “great” one. Hans Zimmer is one of my favorite composers ever. His soundtracks are always filled with such an epic vibe. Even if the film itself isn’t that good, his scores are still able to elevate it in some way. The Lion King is one of his most memorable scores due to how emotionally compelling it is, even in the subtlest moments.\r\n\r\nDuring the stampede sequence, the score doesn’t lend you time to breathe. Its high rhythm and continuously growing music keep any viewer at the edge of the seat, waiting for it to be over. Then, when Simba descends and approaches his dad, the score is so subtle. Completely opposite to the previous sumptuous and grand sound. It’s that nuance plus the impact of the scene itself that make me cry. In the last scene that I mentioned above, it’s solely the score that brings in the chill-inducing tears. If Simba climbed Pride Rock with no soundtrack, it would just be a good ending. However, from the exact moment that the score fades in, it instantly turns that sequence into an epic finale. The slow-motion walk to the top, the immersive score, Simba’s roar … Damn it, I’m crying again!\r\n\r\nThe animation is some of Disney’s best. It’s not by chance that the Disney Renaissance Era (1989-1999), which was the return to form by Disney, has the best animation quality of its history, and a lot of the memorable movies that marked everyone’s childhood. Its expressiveness and ease to make animals emote elevates the story and its characters. There’s no need for any kind of dialogue when you can see how the characters are reacting and understand what they’re feeling. The wide shots are beautiful to look at and worthy of being anyone’s wallpaper even today.\r\n\r\nThe songs are remarkable and they influenced an entire generation. Can You Feel the Love Tonight, Circle of Life, Be Prepared, Hakuna Matata, … Every single song is someone’s favorite. The voice work is perfect. James Earl Jones gives such an outstanding vocal performance that even when discussing his career’s biggest role, Darth Vader isn’t the obvious choice. Jeremy Irons and his raspy voice elevate Scar as the villainous character. If you close your eyes and only hear every character’s voice, without having watched the film previously, you can easily identify who’s the “bad guy”, and that’s unbelievably good. Everyone else is amazing, but these two gentlemen are astonishing, and they deserve to be remembered forever as the voices of these iconic roles.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in the end, the two pillars of every movie always matter the most: story and characters. The Lion King has an especially compelling screenplay, one that teaches its viewers how to handle loss, but also how to grow up and overcome our worst fears. It’s true that most people cry watching this film, but those same people are filled with joy by the end because they accompanied Simba’s journey. From being a reckless and innocent cub to becoming the king that everyone needed, while also making his father extremely proud. Even though it’s a very tragic movie, Timon and Pumbaa are two hilarious characters that keep bringing some sense of happiness by delivering some well-needed laughs. Their laid-back lifestyle is something that everyone desires, but when you have responsibilities, you can’t just hide from them. You must learn how to be what everyone needs you to be, without losing the essence of who you are.\r\n\r\nIt’s a masterpiece! It doesn’t matter if it’s an animated film. It doesn’t matter if it was “made for kids”. People need to stop looking at animated flicks as something juvenile that only children can watch while parents can do something else. If parents watched this kind of inspirational animated movies as well, maybe the world would be a better place. The Lion King is one of my favorite films of all-time, and it’s undeniably one of Disney’s best original movies. From the gorgeous animation to the beautiful score, from the emotionally compelling story to the life journey Simba goes through, from the chill-inducing tearful moments to the loud laughs … The Lion King is just perfect. Hopefully, its “live-action” remake will keep its essence and deliver these feelings once again.\r\n\r\nRating: A+",

  "content": "Certainly not one of Disney's better animations from a technical perspective - the artwork lacks the vibrancy and detail of many of their earlier stories; but the combined efforts of Sir Tim Rice, Elton John and Hans Zimmer make this an enjoyable fantasy adventure. It is told in two parts - the first sees a son \"Simba\" born to the king \"Mufasa\"; a curious little fella who, alongside his friend \"Nala\" is inquisitive and mischievous - a real pain in the neck to the king's major-domo \"Zazu\". One fan the new cub really doesn't have, however, is the king's rather unimpressed brother \"Scar\" who hatches a plan to depose his brother and take over the kingdom. He manages to achieve exactly this and to get the youngster to blame himself and head off, alone, into exile. The second part is much more fun; he falls in with a warthog and is soon eating colourful grubs and living a peaceful, jolly life far from home. That idyllic existence is not to last long, however - \"Nala\" discovers he is still alive and races to alert him of the disaster that has befallen the kingdom under the rule of his uncle and his trusty band of hyenas. The musical numbers help it build to a gripping denouement, with clever, quite witty dialogue from some good - though not great - voice talents from the likes of James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg to keep the pot boiling. It is an enjoyable film to watch but I wasn't captivated by it.",

  "content": "Terminator 2 is basically one of the greatest films of all time, its an absolute must watch if you like Science Fiction, Action, or even Comedy films. It could have been so bad, but the film somehow pulls it off with crazy stunts, an amazing cast and a great story. \r\n\r\nThe film really tackles the fate of humanity straight on which gets you thinking about our path as a species but also what we can do today to change things. The story takes you on a journey which is one of the most believable time travel movies of all time.\r\n\r\nThe action scenes are fantastic, with wall to wall fighting, car chases and military maneuvers that will keep you on the edge of your seat. That's mixed with a great cast and brilliant story telling from the directory. I would say its even better than the first movie which is also a classic.\r\n\r\nOverall I have probably seen this movie 20 or 30 times over the last 25 years(go is it that long!!) and still don't get bored. Its a timeless classic that I urge everyone to watch.",

Especially when you consider how completely every single sequel managed to miss the mark.\r\n\r\nI like to imagine that in the Good Timeline, where everything isn't Terrible™, this movie is exactly the same, but the trailer doesn't spoil the twist about Robert Patrick being a Terminator and Arnie being a good guy. I know that they also spoil the twist about who's a Terminator and who's not and who's a bad guy and who's not in the trailers for the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th too, but I'm pretty sure that in the Good Timeline those never got made, so whatever.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★★★½ - Ridiculously strong appeal.

Now Arnold is a caring unfeeling robot, and we missed a whole movie where Sarah Connor went hard into training.\r\n\r\nThis has twists, escapes, a liquid terminator, better special and practical effects, some big explosions, active discussion of how to change the future, and some really iconic moments.\r\n\r\nThe movie isn't chatty in the traditional sense, once Arnold gets involved, all the dialogue outside the asylum is very much to mechanically move the plot forward.  The terminators don't voluntary \"chat\", they more vomit exposition dialogue.\r\n\r\nWhile I'll always remember this as a great movie, it isn't without its flaws.  Hearing John's pre-pubescent voice cracking almost made me turn it off, and I know I found a couple of (small) problems while I was watching, but I couldn't remember them by the end of the movie, so they're clearly not that important.  I may have been a bad foley sound on a weapon, and probably something that the T-800 that didn't seem robo-talk enough.\r\n\r\nI honestly don't know who isn't going to like this movie:  it even has a low kill count.",

The Robert Patrick T-1000 liquid metal thing looked amazing, Patrick acted ominous and frightening, and seemed like a legit threat despite the size difference between he and Arnold.\r\n\r\nAnd in the process the T-1000 managed to produce some truly creepy visuals.\r\n\r\nAnd this John Connor, Edward Furlong, was absolutely amazing. You really got the sense from him that he could be the man that leads the rebellion in the future.\r\n\r\nAnd, Sarah Connor was buff, and upped her game as the heroine that could do, well, actually do the action she was required to preform. And not only that she was creepy and obsessed as well. She looked and acted like the kind of survivalist that would train the future savior of the world.\r\n\r\nIt all came together as a brilliant move with old Arnold playing the good guy this time, and, though it was an obvious bank on his star power, they pulled it off so no one would care. Right down to the first meeting where John didn't know if he could be trusted or not.\r\n\r\nIt was a fantastic story with fantastic visuals, and it all made of a stellar and entertaining watch.",

Turns out that he is the target of the the latest \"Skynet\" plot to destroy the resistance to their impending world domination (in a worryingly close 2029!). They have sent a new, improved, \"T1000\" (Robert Patrick) back in time to throttle him. Luckily, his future self has had the presence of mind to send one of the original models (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back on protection detail. As the devastation mounts and the bodies pile up, the young man convinces his protector to get his mother out of her secure institution - the authorities weren't convinced about her stories of futuristic \"terminator\" robots after last time - and also, to stop routinely killing people! It took James Cameron quite a while to put this sequel together, and it is almost as good as the original. Loads of action, some great visual and pyrotechnic effects as well as some quite engaging comedy moments that allow the story to deliver a surprising amount of characterisation for an action movie. You do feel just the tiniest bit invested in them, and though I did find the denouement dragged out just a little, it's a solidly entertaining piece of big screen cinema that allows a man who really cannot act to own the screen.

  "content": "With mankind reduced to living amidst a god-fearing zealousness in a city under a mountain where they are ruled by a decrepit overlord and his much younger queen (Amara Okereke), it would appear that their only hope of salvation from that salvation rests with the witch “Gray Alys” (Milla Jovovich). If she can make direct eye contact with you, then she can manipulate what you think and see. She has only narrowly escaped the “Enforcer” (Arly Jover) when she receives a couple of visitors who ask her for a favour. She cannot decline their request so long as they pay, and so must accept their challenge to obtain a shape-shifting wolf for them. The only place that this could be found is in the lawless “Lost Lands” and for that she needs the help of the legendary hunter “Boyce” (Dave Bautista). He hasn’t his troubles to seek either, but after a bit of mutual rescuing, they ally and set off on their quest. Of course, the “Enforcer” is in hot pursuit on an heavily armoured train and so with volcanoes, demons and her crusading troops on their tails it’s not easy task to stay alive in the first place let alone track and catch their quarry. By about half an hour in, we have plundered just about everything from “Indiana Jones” via “Lord of the Rings” (I’m sure I saw “Treebeard here”); “Underworld”, “Harry Potter and the” (take your pick) and, of course, “Mad Max” as this derivative dystopian story lumbers along in an entirely predictable fashion. There’s not the slightest hint of chemistry between the two stars at the top of the billing and what jeopardy there is comes straight from the CGI folks who do, admittedly, manage to create quite an imaginatively crafted world of dilapidated human civilisation to compensate for the writer’s rather mundanely crafted one of human collapse. It’s not remotely scary and the combat scenes are repetitive; the scheming and plotting with Okereke and her eye-candy henchboy “Jerais” (Simon Lööf) are lacklustre and the conclusion leaves virtually nothing to the imagination, even in the dark! It’s an easy way to kill some time in a cinema, but I doubt anyone will ever remember it afterwards - even if you were in the thing.",

  "content": "Hail to the Science Fiction gods as they came to their senses and granted upon the eagerly movie-going masses the long-awaited arrival of a stunning and opulent _Blade Runner_ sequel. Perhaps we should praise the understated genius and visionary mastermind Ridley Scott for his 1982 directorial accomplishment in serving up what appeared to be an underappreciated and overlooked SF thriller in its heyday over three decades ago only for it to emerge now as one of the greatest Science Fiction futuristic capers worthy of its cult classic following?\r\n\r\nMaybe the long overdue kudos are reserved for the diehard nostalgic _Blade Runner_ bunch whose committed and fanatical fandom was the key catalyst for this undeniably brilliant, brainy, dazzling and polished presentation to resurface and give new vitalizing breath and striking energy to the Science Fiction genre in conception? Could it be possible that Hollywood simply saw opportunistic and healthy box office receipts to restart another pop cultural juggernaut from yesteryear’s cinematic scene?\r\n\r\nIs there a returning Harrison Ford fixation/fetish blossoming courtesy of his past blockbuster film resume that boasts the obvious inclusion of prominent SF/adventure fantasy biggies such as both the _Star Wars_ phenomenon and the _Indiana Jones_ installments with _Blade Runner_ now taking up the matinee mantle?\r\n\r\nRegardless of the film-making forces at hand or the key reasoning for this 164 minute visually arresting odyssey updated and packaged for bombastic _Blade Runner_ enthusiasts and dedicated SF connoisseurs the proof is in the proverbial pudding as **Blade Runner 2049** has made its auspicious presence known and succeeds thrillingly as an indelible wonderment in imagination, intrigue and intelligence.\r\n\r\nBreathtakingly rich and vibrant in its overlong execution, **Blade Runner 2049** is a lustrous escapist epic that resonates with snappy pop, thought-provoking tendencies and atmospheric grittiness that soundly resonates. And yes…the participation of the aforementioned and omnipresent Ford reprising his role from 35 years ago is indeed the appealing and motivating factor to re-enter the anxiety-driven world of intrusive replicants,  societal annihilation and the guessing game of humanity infiltration.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the intense workmanlike charm and structured suspense in the rebooted **Blade Runner 2049** has not missed a single beat as it colorfully brings its brand of contemplative tension and underlying humorous texture to this sumptuous spectacle. Importantly, the film’s philosophical edginess and saturated cynicism stays true to Scott’s unflinching vision of introspection about the valued properties of life and who are the chief architects of such a unique gift of existence. Consequently, speechless Science Fiction audiences once again are transfixed by the mesmerizing yet old adage about the rivaling ‘have’s and ‘have nots’ especially so vital in the gloomy squalor and doomsday darkness that Scott created so fervently in his vintage edition that set the stage for renegade blade runners in a power struggle with defiant, roguish replicants disastrously flirting with the sacred boundaries of humankind.\r\n\r\nFilmmaker Denis Villeneuve (‘Arrival’, ‘Sicario’, ‘Prisoners’) has stepped into some pretty mighty cinematic shoes in dusting of the mothballs of _Blade Runner’s_ haunting and hedonistic past in an accomplished effort to bring forth a percolating potboiler of a challenging and imaginative hue to its succulent successor in 2049 with surging, exquisite aplomb. Screenwriters Michael Green (‘Alien: Covenant’, ‘Logan’) and Hampton Fancher (‘Blade Runner’, ‘The Minus Man’) manage to brilliantly convey the dystopian disillusionment as the caustic yet compelling commentary concerning the decline of humanity and how it is feverishly on the brink of non-existence. The fuzzy lines are crossed for the calculating chaos and corruptible wheels that are turning so aimlessly and shockingly. The sins of sinners, good, bad or indifferent, gloriously are stemmed in moodiness and mystery. Additionally, notably iconic cinematographer Roger Deakins (‘Fargo’) cultivates a dank, hazy-coated landscape where shadowy imagery compliments the dour suspicions of determined man versus durable machine co-existing in a hostile futuristic fantasy world of techno-dismal dimensions. Also, kudos are reserved for Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch for their soaring, energetic score that undercuts the tension and turmoil.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, Ryan Goslin (Oscar-nominated for 2016’s ‘La La Land’) is a young blade runner known as ‘K’ whose mission is to track down veteran Rick Deckard (the returning Harrison Ford…also a former Oscar nominee) in the aftermath of a major uncovered secretive revelation that requires the missing senior badge-flashing blade runner’s undivided attention. The problem remains, however, is that Deckard has been out of circulation for three decades and so the search is on for K to hunt down the long-absent Deckard.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Officer K’s critical and contemplative police work is, to mildly put it, seek out the about-to-expire, unpredictable and resistant replicants and eradicate them when necessary. The replicants, mechanical menaces with artificial intelligence that are living among the humans incognito, are the main focus of the LAPD and K enthusiastically is immersed in the manhunt for the hidden techno-tyrants with militant mindsets that could strike at any moment among the walking flesh. K strives to put them out of their mechanical misery as his sworn duty to serve and protect but he is handcuffed (no pun intended) by the political politeness and procedural proprieties as pushed by his boss Lt. Joshi (Robin Wright). Basically, K is under surveillance based on his fragile mental state and Joshi is the one to contain this gritty-minded cop’s wandering psyche.\r\n\r\nThankfully, there is undeniable texture and intensity that fortifies **Blade Runner 2049** due to the layered and complex story that effectively taps into the robust realm of man’s possible mercy call at the dominant feet of advanced and sophisticated technology. This observational sentiment certainly rings true in contemporary times as selective human beings feel lost, intimidated, overwhelmed and need to surrender to the mounting shifty pressures of an exposed society seemingly ruled by sinning opportunists on both sides of the shady aisle, mechanisms rendered equally with blood and bolts.\r\n\r\nRefreshingly, **Blade Runner 2049** is devoutly cerebral in passion and old school perception. Oddly, Villeneuve’s mixture of science fictional roots and thought-provoking dramatic art house probing works while adding a realistic and somber milieu of existential foreshadowing. Gosling is gloriously geared as the hound dog-faced law enforcer too close for comfort on the fringe of film noir-style burnout as he gets embroiled deep into an abyss of head-scratching discoveries. Ford does not miss a single beat as the gravel-faced, handsome-aged Deckard saddled in adventurous mode despite the matured years since his early 80s heyday in the mundane, ground-breaking _Blade Runner_ blueprint from yesterday. Oscar winner Jared Leto (‘Dallas Buyers Club’) joyously lets it all hang out as the wickedly off-kilter character Niander Wallace. The feminine inclusion of Wright’s top policing babysitter Joshi and Ana de Armas as K’s love interest, Joi, are welcomed personalities. Ex-wrestler/actor Dave Bautista (hot off the ‘Guardians Of The Galaxy’ film series) is a larger-than-life specimen as always in proven popcorn blockbusters.\r\n\r\nConvincingly well-structured, profound, purposeful and without a prosaic bone in its bountiful body **Blade Runner 2049** is stunningly sumptuous Science Fiction theater for the thinking man and for the progressive machinery master-blasters as well.\r\n\r\n**Blade Runner 2049** (2017)\r\n\r\nWarner Bros. Pictures\r\n\r\n2 hrs. 44 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford, Robin Wright, Jared Leto, Ana de Armas, Sylvia Hoeks, Mackenzie Davis, Lennie James, Dave Bautista and Carla Juri\r\n\r\nDirected by: Denis Villeneuve\r\n\r\nWritten by: Michael Green and Hampton Fancher\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Science Fiction/Action & Adventure/Fantasy/Drama\r\n\r\nCritic’s Rating: ***1/2 stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** (2017",

The first movie was a rather dark one after all and this one is a truly post-apocalyptic one. I quite liked the first movie despite its dark setting though. However this one takes the darkness and melancholy to an entirely new level.\n\nAs I said before, technically the movie is great. The scenery is stunning whether it is a dirty little hut out in the badlands or the equally dirty vast cityscapes. The scenes of the abandoned city where Decker is (re)introduced is sad but beautiful.\n\nThe acting is more or less great from all the main characters and the special effects are very well done and just right to fit with the rest of the movie.\n\nUnfortunately I cannot bring myself to give it more than 3 out of 5 stars. It has nothing to do with the quality of the film but a lot to do with my personal taste which of course is reflected in my ratings.",

  "content": "The only thing _great_ about Blade Runner 2049 is the cinematography and the Atari sign, but it was just trying to copy Blade Runner instead of a new story. Outside of that it's dog dung. The music is a poor knock off Vangelis score. The story is basically fan-service and pandering by the studio with the tons of plot holes. It includes of biblical references, and aspects from the books _Fahrenheit 451_ by Ray Bradbury, that also takes place in 2049, mixed with _1984_ by George Orwell to try to come off as intellectual, but utterly fails and is poorly done. It practically ignored _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep_ by Phillip K. Dick. The original Blade Runner film did too, but at least that film was interesting. This film doesn't introduce anything new or anything that could be considered an original idea. The editing is awful. Dragging out scenes for no reason other than an attempt to appear \"intelligent and serious\" or to try to mimic 'Blade Runner' doesn't work since there's no reason for it story wise. It's kind of like a Zack Snyder movie, in that regards. The acting is subpar and wooden. Harrison Ford was phoning it in. It's a shallow film that misses the point. Here's a neat idea, why not try to actually adapt _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep_ into a film.\r\n\r\nI don't understand why people think this shallow movie is an intellectual and intelligent movie.",

What makes someone truly human or real is a profound question with which an escapist like myself doesn't want to grapple. But with all that being said, Blade Runner 2049 is a masterpiece regardless of your movie taste. The beauty of the bright neon colors splashing across the cold, dismal, muted city of Los Angeles in 2049 is breathtaking. Every scene and moment is a visual feast filled with practical effects despite being a sci-fi film with flying cars and futuristic technology. While parts of the story and action were a little slow, Blade Runner 2049 captivates and intrigues from start to finish.",

He is \"K\" - working for the new but still all-powerful \"Tyrell Corporation\" tasked with eliminating the last of the \"Nexus\" generation of replicants. It's on one such mission that he, quite literally, unearths a terrible secret that could spell doom for the already crippled society of mankind. \"K\" sets out to gather as much information as he can to prevent this collapse, and gradually comes to realise that the answer might lie with the long disappeared \"Deckard\" (Harrison Ford); his water ego from times gone by. Thing is, though, as his search nears it's conclusion, will he be permitted to discover and act upon the truth? This enhances and augments the original, rather than try to replace it. The story is well held together by a Gosling who makes his presence felt, but who allows the story to develop using imagery and a sparing dialogue. Robin Wright is maybe not the best as his boss \"Joshi\" but it does feature one of the better efforts from Ana de Armas (\"Joi\") as we head towards a denouement that really does look at life as we know it! The photography is dark and gritty, there is a distinct and effective sense of the claustrophobic and the score from Hans Zimmer is one of his best - it really does assist in focussing the attention on the detail of this cleverly constructed and compelling adventure with a conscience. Big screen if you can - the lighting and effects are better appreciated that way.",

It is a classical Hollywood product where the story is mostly there just as a vehicle for allowing the special effects team to do their business. As such it is a success.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts of with a display of action and the afore mentioned special effects with an attack by the Avengers on a bad guy stronghold. Not surprisingly the events sows the seeds for things to come.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts off with quite an interesting story idea with the activation of Ultron. However, once he materializes as a physical entity, it became a bit of seen that, been there and done that. Ultron just turns into yet another “standard” comic book villain a’ la Megatron running around trying to look intimidating while implementing his diabolical scheme. Okay, there was a bit of originality here and there but with the good start I kind of expected a wee bit more.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, the movie does indeed fulfil its purpose of showing off a bunch of super heroes slugging it out in a flurry of special effects and, although the story idea was perhaps not used as intelligently as I had hoped, it is not bad (for this kind of movie of course) and hangs together pretty okay. Sure, it is somewhat contrived and the means by which Ultron tries to exterminate humanity is overly complicated but it is still a decent story.\r\n\r\nOverall the movie was entertaining and provided the necessary special effects and super hero fix for those who are inclined to enjoy those kind of movies. I certainly am and, not surprisingly, the kids liked it as well.",

  "content": "**A long form review originally posted in 2015:**\r\n\r\nI’ve just returned from two back-to-back viewings of _Avengers: Age of Ultron_, and I do not regret one bit going in for that second helping.\r\n\r\nI lost my steam on the _Age of Ultron_ wagon at a very inopportune moment. About three days before it came out. I was so heavily anticipating it for such a long time, that I was actually much more excited to see this movie when it was still two months away than I was waiting in line to get into the cinema it was playing at. The combination of the market-saturation and the fact that the _Ultron _hype-train has been running for literally years, with a first trailer dropping seven months before the damn thing came out, meant I got weary of the thing just a fraction too soon. But I’m a sucker for the MCU, and there was no way I was missing the sequel to my favourite superhero movie of all time.\r\n\r\nI won’t harp on too much, because I don’t want to spoil anything (especially given that the movie isn’t even out in most parts of the world), I will put out a spoilertalk on this blog at some point down the line, but for now just let me leave you with a couple of quick thoughts.\r\n\r\n_Age of Ultron_ is not the best film of all time. It’s not the best superhero film of all time, it’s not even the best MCU film. Honestly, I personally feel it’s not even the best MCU Phase 2 film. But it is still good. And that’s what’s important here. But what do I mean by that? \r\n\r\nWell, for starters, in and of itself, I loved it, a breach past an 80% approval rating from me is no small thing. The things we enjoyed from the first _Avengers_are here. The mesmerising action spectacles of course, but I more mean the character moments we got between the Avengers themselves, that was my favourite part of the first film and we get it here again in spades. \r\n\r\nEvery new thing Joss has added to the plate works splendidly as well, real Hawkeye story, new heroes, a new villain, an updated world, all of these things are big ticks in lots of boxes.\r\n\r\nSo if everything from _The Avengers_ works and everything they’ve added works great too, why is _Age of Ultron_ not a perfect film? For spoiler-free purposes I will not go into detail, but that’s okay because the answer is quite simple: Everything in _Age of Ultron_ is great. It’s what’s not in _Age of Ultron_ that’s the problem.\r\n\r\nJoss Whedon said that the film had to be cut by nearly an hour. That way you get more showings in, and that means more money. Now I’m not saying we need every minute of that hour back, but what we ended up being left with, was just enough for _Age of Ultron_ to be the _Thor: The Dark World_ of the _Avengers _franchise (it was a far superior film to _Dark World_, but hear me out). _Age of Ultron_ is little more than a holding pattern. The set-ups for future films take up too much time for the story to bear the weight of some actual story, but everything that occurs in the film itself somehow also has virtually no consequence on world it is a part of. I can’t say it more plainly than that: It’s a holding pattern. It introduces some stuff, but it doesn’t stand alone the first film did. It’s not such a big deal when the solo-movies do that (like the aforementioned _Dark World_) because we have _The Avengers_ films for those to pay off in. But when an _Avengers_ entry is just more of the same, I can’t fully get behind it.\r\n\r\nThat all said, _Age of Ultron_ is of course a lot of fun. A huge amount of fun, I can’t state that enough. And there’s literally nothing more important something in the entertainment industry can be. These are just the things holding it back from taking it up to the next level (or if I’m being completely honest, even taking it to the level the first film was at).\r\n\r\n75%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_",

The movie's fun. The dialogue is frequently clever and humourous. And I really appreciated the quiet bits of storytelling that Whedon was able to sneak in. It's just that at the end of the day, the villain is weak sauce, there's way too much set up for other movies, and if I'm criticizing Man of Steel for having excessive destruction, I can't give Avengers a pass since they needlessly blow up not one, not two, but three cities.

  "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nObviously, Joker is one of my most anticipated movies of 2019. I mean, how couldn't it be?! Besides belonging to the superhero genre, DC has been on a streak of great films within its universe, so an isolated installment definitely excites me, especially about one of the evilest villains ever. It's by far one of the less comic-book-y flicks of the century. It doesn't follow the generic origin story formula, it avoids any cliches associated with the genre, and it's the type of movie that's becoming more and more rare nowadays. It's a character study like we haven't seen in a long time.\r\n\r\nI'll simply begin with the person that elevates the entire thing: Joaquin Phoenix. Now, if there's something I'm not going to do is compare his performance with Heath Ledger's. That's the number one mistake people are going to keep making forever. First of all, The Dark Knight and Joker couldn't be more distinct films, even if they belong to the same genre (despite Joker being unique, it's still about a famous comic-book villain). Then, despite Phoenix and Ledger portraying the same \"version\" of the clown (crazy, sadistic psychopath), the former is 90% Arthur Fleck while the latter is 100% Joker, throughout each of their movies. Finally, Phoenix is the sole protagonist of this feature, while Ledger had the best live-action Batman sharing the spotlight.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it's both unfair, and a bit unreasonable to compare both interpretations since their roles have a different impact on the narrative, as well as each film being entirely different. In the end, both are impressive. However, let's switch to Phoenix since he's the star of this show … He has 2019's best performance, by far! With a strong marketing campaign, I'm sure he'll get that Oscar. I hope so! It's so well-deserved. Todd Phillips and Scott Silver developed a brilliant screenplay, but Phoenix elevates it to a whole other level.\r\n\r\nThroughout the entire runtime, I felt weird. Perturbed. Even uncomfortable with what I was watching and consequently feeling. It's a dark, brutal, violent, emotionally powerful origin of a villain who I feel disturbingly empathetic towards. Phoenix makes the story work due to its remarkably captivating display of someone who's mentally ill. Arthur Fleck slowly becoming crazier is due to how society behaves and not due to some chemical pool that transforms his skin white and hair green (nothing wrong with this, but I know which origin story I prefer). \"The world is getting crazier out there\", and it becomes excruciatingly painful to deal with it, especially when so much is going on with Arthur’s personal life, and most of it he doesn't even realize because he tries to hide everything behind a smile.\r\n\r\nIt's a screenplay filled with narrative twists that not only pack a punch of surprise but leave you feeling extremely upset. The last act is one of the best in the last few years. If the second act is an enormous build-up, the last one is a terrific payoff. I can't remember the last movie I saw where I loved 100% every single narrative decision. I wouldn't do any of the big moments differently. There are so many excellent references hidden in plain sight that comic-book fans (and fans of the TDK trilogy as well) will love just like I did. In the ending, there's one pivotal moment in particular that serves as the absolute climax … I got chills all over my body. They couldn't have done that scene more perfect. I only have one tiny nitpick with the way some scenes feel repetitive since they neither move the plot forward or give us anything new. Some of these still help to create tension, some feel like they're just… there.\r\n\r\nA Best Picture and Best Actor nominations seem to be on its way, but these are not the only achievements that deserve to be recognized. The original score by Hildur Guðnadóttir is incredibly addictive, so much that I'm listening to it while writing this review. It definitely helps to generate tremendous build-up, and it elevates the sinister environment of Gotham City. Lawrence Sher's cinematography is utterly stunning. The underexposure of some scenes is glorious. Sher paints the screen with so many gorgeous shots, especially with his close-ups on Phoenix, where the latter is able to shine. Jeff Groth is also impeccable in the editing room. There are several long takes with Phoenix just giving his all and letting all his emotions out (or keeping them all contained), which is always something I deeply appreciate since it helps with the flow of the narrative.\r\n\r\nRegarding the film's controversy surrounding its messages and the incentive to violence, I really don't know what to say. It's ridiculous. I remember those times when going into the movie theater was a surreal experience. It was the number one place for people to forget about their lives, jobs, everything. Joker is a fictional story! It's the origin of one of the worst psychopaths in the history of comic-books and cinema. If people expected to leave the theater \"happy\" or \"joyful\", then at least one of the film's message is right: society really is getting crazier. Have people forgotten who Joker is? What could you possibly expect from his origin story?!\r\n\r\nNowadays, no one knows how to behave (social media is the primary source for spreading hate). No one respects the fellow citizen or even the world itself. More and more people only look at their own bellies. Political agendas are everywhere. New extreme movements are created every other year. Social hypersensibility is exponentially growing. The same way some people will hate this movie for not being able (or simply not wanting) to accept that they feel empathy towards a murderer, people all around the world behave like their actions don't reflect on another person's life and on their own planet. If people get ruthlessly violent because they watched Joker, how can someone complain that the film's message is bad when it's eventually true?\r\n\r\nAll in all, Joker is one of the best movies of the year, and it's definitely on my Top3 at the date of this review. Joaquin Phoenix delivers my favorite male performance of 2019, by elevating a script about the origin of one of the evilest villains ever. The way he gradually becomes more insane is worthy of study, but it's how he's able to make the audience create empathy towards a psychopath that leaves me disturbingly captivated. Todd Phillips produces a character-study filled with an astonishingly tense build-up and one of the most chill-inducing payoffs of the last few years. With every single narrative decision nailed perfectly, Hildur Guðnadóttir's score and Lawrence Sher's cinematography stand out. The lack of restraint in showing the unmerciful violence (physical and mental) that society inflicts on one another is what makes us feel unsettled. Because we know it's mostly true, and we refuse to accept it. It's not a film about the Joker. It's a very realistic portrayal of someone (anyone!) who can become someone like him. And it's disturbingly brilliant!\r\n\r\nPS: Robert DeNiro (Murray Franklin) and Zazie Beetz (Sophie Dumond) are also great. Phoenix's performance is so mesmerizing that I almost forgot there were other actors in the movie.\r\n\r\nRating: A",

  "content": "Joker. The character that has existed since 1940, has become so heavy with so many different portrayals, different origins, that it feels impossible for any mortal man alive to impersonate the scattered personalities. It is an insurmountable task for any director to digest it all and still produce one more.\r\n\r\nTodd Phillips had a crazy challenge. He brought in one of the best actors alive to lift it with him, Joaquin Phoenix. Together, they have built a mass-market masterpiece which is just above the crop. It is appropriately crazy and completely focussed on the central character. The narrator goes close to the shores of that craziness, wets his feet but remains dry to tell this story. It is like those news reporters which go closer to the burning amazon, but it is impossible to step in the fumes. In no way, Joker is telling his story. Instead, his story is told to us and there are pillars of sanity (like the detectives, asylum clerk etc.) which remain steadfast to give a strong anchor to the audience. This dilutes the effect of the film.\r\n\r\nWith the copious amount of material on Joker already, I wished to consider this film as a standalone character study vaguely inspired by the batman universe. But this is not entirely possible. I was forced to think about it on two levels. With Batman and Without Batman. \r\n\r\nWith Batman, The Joker is on the home turf. There have been many renditions of Joker, and Heath Ledger's portrayal is still vivid in my mind. I knew that Arthur here will go on to become someone who is going to say, “‎Introduce a little anarchy. Upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos...”. When I was thinking Joker in the context of Batman, I could not keep Ledger's joker too far away. I was searching for a path for Arthur to go from the mentally unstable to the calculating anarchist. I was left searching for that path when the movie ended. To remain as the crown prince of crime, and to justify the title of the greatest adversary of Batman, just mental instability isn't good enough. He needs to be much more intelligent, much more cunning. These traits are often visible early, In the case of Arthur, I could not find that complete foundation upon which the later psyche can stand. This reminded me of Cameron Monaghan's Jerome Valeska. The joker of my understanding is somewhere between the cruelty of Jerome and pitiable delusions of Arthur. Also, the iconic Batman moment was not needed in this. I kept feeling that Joker is trying to stand with the support of Batman's tale as a clutch. A safety net enforced by the producers.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if I consider this movie as a standalone tale, then it was a bit more satisfying. There are tearjerker movies where nothing good ever happens with the protagonist. A series of bad lucks, or difficulties keep blocking a normal life. He is most definitely poor, has a sub-optimal family background, has a medical affliction which is unique and provides a foundation of the pity I felt. This is not very far from Rani Mukharjee's Hichki if you only consider the medical condition. Rani's Naina had Tourette syndrome while Joaquin's Arthur suffers from pseudobulbar affect. The setting and genre make the two films vastly different. More often than not, I have noticed these disorders lift a lot of burden from the narrative. In the case of Joker, couple his disorder with usually being in the wrong place at the wrong time, you have a travesty of human life. Add to that, an unstable parent, amplify it with the volatile societal conditions, you have a perfect decoction of what Joker is made of. As a tale of its own, it works. The delivery is great thanks to the spectacular performance. It also helps to increase the awareness of mental health. But when you strip off all the Batman context, it remains a well-acted and averagely written tale. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is a single film, and I felt it is torn between these two polarising treatments. It wants to find its ground, which it finds. But that ground is far from being sensational. It remains somewhat indecisive. It can not be well soaked in Batman lore like James Gordon's tale, Gotham is. I am considering Gotham because both Gotham and Joker do not feature Batman, but they both have Bruce. Gotham understands its lore and fully embraces it but Joker does not want to. At the same time, as a tale of the psychologically troubled protagonist, Joker tries to play safe with the aim to please audience en-mass. I kept thinking about American Psycho and The Machinist. (Coincidently, both star ex-Batman Christian Bale). Those two take you in the psyche of the protagonist. Those take you inside the burning Amazon and not stand at a safe distance. Joker does not aim to do so. \r\n\r\nI am not at all qualified to talk about the acting performances. Joaquin Phoenix is in every frame and the way he waltzes between emotions is terrifyingly amazing. The Tai Chi to calm himself down, the menacing stare when finally becomes the Joker, those are chilling. He lives the character to the best of his abilities. Regrettably, he does not have the same level of writing support which Heath Ledger had and so due to no fault of his own, Joaquin could not topple Heath Ledger's portrayal of the crown prince of crime.\r\n\r\nIf I consider Todd Philips's entire resume, this was a genre shift for him. He knew very well that the biggest trump card is Joaquin Phoenix, so he takes no risk. He keeps him in focus, almost always all the setting and cinematography works for him. The only exception being Robert De Niro. Robert is allowed to carry his scenes quite independently. I think Todd Philips relied on both these giants to carry their parts. Sadly, I had gone to a theatre which had a bad print or screen so I think I will have to watch it again sometimes to enjoy the cinematography.\r\n\r\nI realised, I kept writing a lot and this is already over a thousand words. If you are here and reading still, I must say thank you. To summarise, The Joker worked for me and I enjoyed it, but I would not consider it the best depication of the iconic villain from comic books. The best may yet come.",

  "content": "Okay, this film has already been so widely debated that I’m not sure what I can really add to the conversation. So, I’ll just give my thoughts.\r\n\r\n“Joker” is a fairly basic character study of Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill man who feels increasingly marginalized by an uncaring and brutal society in Gotham City. To start, the characters, except for Arthur himself, are pretty flat. They seem to have little purpose other than to further Arthur’s story. This includes Thomas Wayne, who in other media is portrayed as a man of many dimensions, wealthy but caring, and instilling these values in his son Bruce. Here, he is portrayed as much more uncaring and elitist. Which gives much less of an impact in the inevitable alley scene we see in everything remotely related to Batman. More on this in a minute. It’s important to the point.\r\n\r\nArthur suffers a condition that makes him burst into laughter at inappropriate times. He also has other unspecified mental illnesses. We’re never given the specifics. This is actually a little troubling because of the general depiction of mental illness. It almost seems like they are saying that if someone is mentally ill then they are a ticking time bomb and it’s only a matter of time before they go off. This is not a good look.\r\n\r\nAfter a series of events, Arthur begins spiraling downward, but at the same time realizes how much influence he can have over other people, an aspect of the Joker that isn’t often explored. And this is where the characters other than Arthur being rather flat comes into play.\r\n\r\nThere’s more than one indication that we are actually witnessing these events through Arthur’s eyes. And this creates a brilliant depiction of a narcissistic personality. The only character that gets fully fleshed out is Arthur himself, but he can’t or won’t connect with other people to see their depth. As such, we get to see narcissism from the inside, no connection to others and in fact seeing them as pawns in his own schemes. It’s subtle and definitely not in your face, but if you look carefully, the hints are there.\r\n\r\nThose who fear that \"Joker\" would glorify incel violence or otherwise can rest a little easier, but as I mentioned, the film isn't without its troubling portrayals. It does vilify the mentally ill, which creates a whole host of other issues. The movie swings wildly between \"excellent\" and just \"okay,\" and sometimes even \"meh.\" As such, it gets a recommendation, but only a mild one.",

It’s heavy and tragic. But what’s the message? Simply that this is how a quirky man who wanted to make people laugh became The Joker. He’s a little reminiscent of the clown in Steve Gerber’s “Night of the Laughing Dead” in Man-Thing #5 (1974).     \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 2 hours, 2 minutes, and was shot in New York City (Bronx, Harlem, Manhattan) and nearby New Jersey (Jersey City & Newark).  \r\n\r\nGRADE: A-/A",

  "content": "the ‘Hangover 2 & 3’, the two most uncomfortable comedies he’s ever directed that felt more crime drama than anything funny. There’s also some dark humor in ‘Joker’ that involves a door chain. It’s silly, yet absolutely terrifying with the given context. A complete departure from his other work and that’s why I think it’s one of his best. I honestly think he made something so unique and meaningful. Seriously, I do.\r\n\r\nThe score by Hildur Guðnadóttir helped set the tone tremendously. A melancholy tone with a chaotic twist. A representation of Arthur slowly drowning in his own misery and pain. A little fun fact: The score for the film were written based on the script even before the actual filming of the movie started, which I think is the best way to do it, if you ask me. Someone to imagine movie by songs and incorporate their interpretation through music.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography was gorgeous and there’s a handful of shots that has imprinted into my memory. Lawrence Sher does an excellent job off showing the decaying Gotham city and the sewer waste look of the city. Bright neon lights with striking colors that manage to make the most run down of places look pretty.\r\n\r\nI like how they actually gave Thomas Wayne a character rather than “guy gets shot in alleyway”. He’s portrayed as a ruthless man with blunt ways of saving Gotham City. However he loves his wife and son, so his unforgiving attitude was all for the shake of keeping his loved ones safe. He’s also a massive movie buff where he often goes to watch the classics on the big screen. So it’s an interesting take on the character viewed in somebody’s else perspective.\r\n\r\nThere’s a scene where Arthur goes to watch a comedy standup show to take notes on a comedians act. Every time a joke is told and everyone laughs, his face is frozen in place with an unsure grin while his eyes look around the room wondering why everyone’s laughing, but when the laughter dies down he jumps to live with a delayed laugh. It’s moments like that are simple, yet says a lot about him. Basically showing how disconnected he is with humor and everyone else.\r\n\r\nNow lets talk about the controversy that's been surrounding this movie:\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most ludicrous controversy in recent memory. The movie will not cause or inspire violence, but shows why violence happens. I mean, there probably has been incidents when somebody committed a horrendous crime because their were influenced by a movie or a game. However, it’s he/she that should be brought into question, not the creators. Maybe this movie could inspire people to think twice about how they treat others. Why not think about the positives? If “Joker” is going to be responsible for violence and mass shootings, then so is every other movie with any form of violence ever. If people really care about how violence is portrayed in movies, then Rob Zombies ‘3 From Hell’ should also receive the same attention. Just imagine ‘Natural Born Killers’ times 100, but I guess it’s not mainstream enough for any of that. And sure, there’s some brutal and raw approach to violence in ‘Joker’, but we all have seen worst. ‘Deadpool’ is more graphic than this. It's not the directors duty to teach morals to the viewer. People will never learn to stop pointing fingers at things to blame and actually do something about it! People often understandment how much power their got.\r\n\r\nAnywhere, sorry about that folks, just had to get that off my chest. Go and check it out.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: “Send in the clowns” ⇠ you’ve gotta sing that like Frank Sinatra.",

As far as I am concerned this movie is an insult to the fans of Batman and the REAL Joker.\r\n\r\nThe “Joker” in this move is a unintelligent deranged nutcase. There is a sob story in the background about how he became that way which is totally uninteresting.\r\n\r\nThe REAL joker is a intelligent criminal mastermind. I was waiting for this nutcase to actually become that for the entire movie. Spoiler alert, it never happened! This guy starts as a useless sobbing nutcase and he ends the movie as the same useless sobbing nutcase.\r\n\r\nThe movie has NOTHING to do with the real Joker. It is a blatant attempt to garner support for a unrelated psychopathic thriller by using the Joker name. If it would have been advertised as such I probably would have, if not liked it, so at least appreciated it for it’s qualities. It is indeed a well done movie technically and the main character is indeed excellently performed.\r\n\r\nHowever, even if I try to distance myself from the deceitful Joker label, I find it overall boring, too long and really a movie about a psychopath probably made by someone with mental issues himself. But then that’s Hollywood today.\r\n\r\nThat the politically biased and elitist so called “critics” on sites like Rotten Tomatoes like it is not really surprising but I have to confess that I am somewhat surprised at the rave ratings by real viewers on some other sites.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I was expecting to be disappointing by this movie. Then I am always cautious about movies getting rave reviews, especially from the previously mentioned totally useless and crappy “review” site. I did not expect this level of disappointment though.

  "content": "**Horror express.**\r\n\r\nA week ago I saw a zombie film from Japan called 'I Am a Hero' and now this Korean. I have not seen a quality zombie film at the recent time. The second tier films like 'Cooties', 'Freaks of Nature', 'Scouts Guide...', all these were comedies. Probably 'World War Z' was the last decent zombie film I have seen and after that this is the one. So the timing of the film was another advantage. Since there's no competition, this zombie film rules. And not to forget the Korean style, they are among the best thriller film makers today.\r\n\r\nDirected by an Anime filmmaker, this is his first live-action film. When I decided to watch it, I thought it would be another Korean film, which rely on father-daughter sentiments. You know I kind of tired of that Korean cliché where at the final stage they let the kid sob and call it a twist. Initially I enjoyed those and later on getting bored of that. With that kind of reasons, I would have missed it. Being a film fanatic, I won't mind to risk a watch, except give up writing a review for it.\r\n\r\nBut in this case, it was completely different. Even the characters, any characters in the film, either in the lead or the supporting ones, all are unpredictable. That's the biggest plus point of the film. At the end you won't be sure, who you were rooting for. You know in those edgy scenes, we blindly back the one we like. You will think you can guess the upcoming scenes, but the writing was very smartly done. Feels like they did not care about a sequel, if this meets a greater success. But who knows, this is a cinema and there were many mysteries kept unsolved, so they can pick up from one of those loops.\r\n\r\n> \"Whatever you do, you must finish what you start. It's worse than not doing it at all.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a divorced, workaholic father and his young daughter. After the progress, many others join them. On her birthday, they decide to visit her mother in Busan. On their train, soon after it took off, they come to know that something is wrong around. With all the chaos unrolling rapidly, a group of survivours gathers in a car since there's no escape as they are trapped in a moving train. How their journey ends, whether they reach a safe place with the fight against the living dead, the narration comes to halt.\r\n\r\nIn the contest of good versus evil, there's no place for sentiments. But at one stage, near the end they cleared the place to attach one. In that final scene you can't resist, even if you are not an emotional person when it comes to the film. As I mentioned earlier that is the part I feared the most would come, but i did not hate it in the context of story development. Because that was a perfect setting to take the story to the next level.\r\n\r\nThere are several twists. Those are from the film characters' perspective than the story wise. They did not bother to tell about the cause of the epidemic. Instead, this film was focused on the train passengers and their fight for survival when the defending options are limited. Just imagine it is a zombie version of another Korean film 'Snowpiercer' or like 'Snakes on a Plane'.\r\n\r\nI have heard there's another film, an animation which is also directed by the same filmmaker and said to be a prequel to this one. If you had liked it, you would be itching to watch that one as well. Hope I would watch it as soon as I get an opportunity. So, my view on it, the film is very good. It was close to two hours long, but once the train journey begins, you won't going to notice the time. I am saying the pace of the film, as well as the events make you dissolve in it completely and forget everything else. This is the best zombie film right now and you should not miss it, especially if you like this theme. Recommended!\r\n\r\n_8/10_",

I don't think I reacted quite how the director wanted me to react during that last act.\r\n\r\nThis is a fascinating premise.  A zombie outbreak that leaks onto a train (with just one infected), and these are \"World War Z\" running, 15 seconds to turn (usually) zombies.  I'm staunchly against running zombies, but when you do something well, it is really hard to discredit you for it.\r\n\r\nThere is one aspect that is truly odd for zombies, but it would be quite the spoiler, it's basically the 3rd act (out of 4).  The writing structure feels very different, it doesn't seem to adhere to a 3 act staple: it really feels like 4 acts broken into chapters (or levels similar to a video game) and as whichever characters survive the transfer from chapter to chapter, the story progresses.  There is clearly though pre-infection establishing act, post infection establishing act, confrontation act, and resolution act.  Once you get past the first act, it's pretty much non-stop action, by the by.\r\n\r\nThe one frustrating part about this movie is that most of the characters seem to have a death wish: despite trying to stay alive, they all seem to want to die.  I understand that a story can't happen without flawed characters, but the things these people do are so remarkably stupid sometimes that the zombies become more believable at times.  It does allow for some of the more amazing scenes though, so it might be somewhat forgiveable.\r\n\r\nThis movie is honestly so good, I really feel like I'm reaching on any of the complaints.",

  "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nZombie apocalypse is far from being a groundbreaking subgenre. The Walking Dead franchise is arguably the most popular show on Earth when it comes to portraying this supernatural future. World War Z and the Zombieland duology play that role in the movies' realm. However, all of these works fail to reach the always high expectations that come with a story set in a time like this. When people ask, \"what's the best zombie apocalypse film ever?\", one doesn't have a clear answer simply because there isn't an outstanding, mind-blowing, near-perfect flick. Well, at least not until 2016, the year of release of the best movie in the genre, Train to Busan.\r\n\r\nI genuinely feel sorry for everyone who refuses to watch foreign films for whatever reason. A different language and/or the display of subtitles shouldn't be enough to convince viewers to ignore so many unique works from all around the world. If someone dares to call themselves a \"zombies fan\" and has not watched Train to Busan yet, then \"fan\" is far from being the right description. This is South Korean cinema at its best. Everyone is 200% committed to their role, whether that is a stunt man or one of the protagonists. Yeon Sang-ho delivers a powerfully suspenseful, intense, epic, and most of all, heartbreaking story with the help of a phenomenal screenplay written by Park Joo-suk.\r\n\r\nWhen the only \"negative\" aspect that I can find is related to \"maybe not-that-logical\" specific actions performed by some characters, I know that I'm nitpicking a near-perfect movie. I struggle to find a single real issue with the entire film. In my opinion, the reason why the latter works so well is largely due to Park Joo-suk's script. Usually, people always think about the zombies first: how do they look? How do they act? Do they run wildly or stroll? Which new attributes or skills do these zombies have different from what we've seen until now? How did it all begin? Is there a cure? Granted, the zombies look cool, and Yeon Sang-ho is able to create impressive action sequences filled with maximum intensity and extreme tension. Entertainment-wise: top-notch.\r\n\r\nHowever, the action only works as well as it does due to the emotional bond that the viewer shares with the (non-infected) human characters. These are beautifully treated and developed in such a remarkable manner. There are easily five to six characters that the viewer ends up caring deeply about. Typically, at least half of this group is expendable in this type of film because some characters show no signs of intelligence or are just douchebags. In Train to Busan, every single character possesses likable traits, besides being directly connected to each other (father-daughter, young couple pregnant). The action scenes are filmed in incredible fashion, but it's the encompassing emotional aura that ultimately elevates them.\r\n\r\nIt's really an emotionally devastating story. The viewer is placed in dozens of situations that require the hardest of choices from the main characters. The generic dilemma \"do I save the person I care about or everyone else?\" is taken to a whole other level with exceptional dialogues, filled with an excruciating amount of suspense, leaving me about to tear up on more than just a couple of times. Every character has a terrific, compelling arc. The main protagonist, Seok-woo (Gong Yoo), goes from being a despicable character, one that I wouldn't mind seeing killed in the first fifteen to twenty minutes, to a lovable father that only wants what's best for her daughter, protecting her at all costs during the apocalypse.\r\n\r\nThis movie is packed with clever social commentary, relatable to this day (and even more during the current global pandemic). Yon-suk (Kim Eui-sung) represents everything that's wrong with our society. A selfish man who thinks he's more important than everyone else due to his class and whose job is more significant than his own family or friends, let alone strangers on a train. He also works as a \"wake-up call\" to our protagonist, as a \"what if\" version of Seok-woo's future if he continues to only focus on his job. Another character of great relevance is Sang-hwa (Ma Dong-seok), a father-to-be who ends up protecting Seok-woo's daughter when her father can't. His bravery and selflessness make him an instant audience favorite.\r\n\r\nTechnically, it's genuinely a flawless film. From the outstanding zombie makeup to the mind-blowing stunt work, everything action-related serves as evidence to prove that South Korean cinema does action a thousand times better than conventional Hollywood. The level of intensity is ridiculous. Lee Hyung-deok's camera work is absolutely brilliant, moving through the train seamlessly, letting the viewer see and understand everything. Aided by excellent editing (Yang Jin-mo) and a phenomenal score (Jang Young-gyu), Yeon Sang-ho generates tension and suspense in a way that makes every single action sequence feel overwhelming, powerful, and even epic.\r\n\r\nA runtime close to the two-hour mark that flies by. The first act perfectly sets up the apocalypse to come with a surprisingly subtle build-up of the exponentially growing chaos. Then, the outbreak in the train which occupies most of the movie's duration. During this period, everything happens. From the nail-biting action sequences to the emotionally powerful moments of character decisions that make this film so shocking. Finally, a third act that left me floored, completely drained of emotions, not knowing exactly how to feel after it all ended. Despite a couple of sequences that I believe were exclusively executed in the way they were to offer an emotionally climactic moment, everything else feels impressively realistic.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Train to Busan is arguably the best zombie apocalypse movie of all-time, at least, until the date of this review. The subgenre finds in Yeon Sang-ho's mind-blowing flick the masterpiece it deserves. From the exceptionally subtle build-up to the emotionally devastating final act, passing through the most vivid, suspenseful, tense depiction of a zombie outbreak ever put to screen, Park Joo-suk's screenplay is the reason why this film succeeds so well. A heartbreaking story featuring astonishingly well-developed characters, surrounded by a powerfully resonant social commentary, even more in the current days. Action-wise, it's South Korean cinema at its best: maximum intensity, phenomenal camera work, seamless editing, chill-inducing score, outstanding commitment from everyone involved, and a fantastic stunt team. Hollywood should learn from movies like this. I can't find a single flaw. It left me emotionally drained. If you're a fan of cinema, no matter the genre, this *must* be on your watchlist!\r\n\r\nRating: A+",

The Kirby-isms shine through brilliantly and every couple of minutes I found myself grinning like an idiot at some new reference or stylistic choice.\r\n\r\n_Logan_ might be the super hero movie for people who don't like super hero movies. _Guardians 2_ is the super hero movie for people who have steeped themselves deeply in the lore of super heroes.

The guardians unravel the mysteries of Star-lord aka Peter Quill's (Chris Pratt) broken history while avoiding constant danger. Oh. And did I mention the soundtrack? Muy bueno! 8)\r\n\r\nUnlike most sequels, Vol. 2 might actually be better than Vol. 1.\r\n\r\nThe entire cast is more likable than the first film. Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista) has more comedic lines like, \"When you're ugly and someone loves you, it means they love you for who you are.\"\r\n\r\nRocket Racoon (Bradley Cooper) still maintains a sentimental but adorably tough persona. And Baby Groot is cute as ever whenever he says,\"I am groot.\" In his baby-voice.\r\n\r\nOne of the more noticeable differences is the relationship between Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Star-lord. It's not as intimate. We were all hoping for a sci-fi sex scene. We don't get it!\r\n\r\nThe fight scenes are nothing less than spectacular. There's a scene with Yondu (Michael Rooker) where he's using a whistle-controlled weapon to kill an entire space crew of villains ALL IN SLOW-MOTION!\r\n\r\nJust go watch the film. It's worth it for the cgi-artwork alone.",

Got to see a funny side in Drax the before edition he was always angry this one he always laughs I like the part he keeps saying positive things and suddenly ends it with a negative touch. Now to talk about gamora and quill love is in the air but she keeps denying it. Quills line “We keep searching for something our whole life and we never realize that it has been with us the whole time”. Always hated yondu but this movie made me change. Did not get to see Thanos, I know he is been kept for the big picture. Rockets awesome one liners especially TASERFACE made me burst out with laughter. An awesome family entertainer with action comedy and adventure. And not to forget mantis she was so freaking innocent.

This story does not have a great adventure in the galaxy. A simple quest, but a thrilling action-adventure. Now this accidental space gang is set to meet the creator.\r\n\r\nIt's time for Peter to meet his father, Ego. As he still upset with his mother's death, his encounter with his father was not as expectedly smooth. On the other side of the story, Rocket, Yandu, Baby Groot make their escape from the captivity. They all end up on the Ego's planet where the rest of the film going to take place. Being the guardians of the galaxy, their fight against the whoever threaten the safety of the universe once again tested with their strength as a team.\r\n\r\nJames Gunn did it again. And I'm confident that he's going to do the same for next as well. All the actors were fantastic like the previous film. This time, little fun with little Groot. Anybody who loved the first would love it too. Being a franchise from Marvel universe, it is yet to join the 'Avengers'. So far so good. I'm now expecting one of the best of best trilogies. Bring it on the volume 3.\r\n\r\n_8/10_",

I can't stand how Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 thinks family dynamic is just two people bickering about how much daddy didn't love them as kids.

Drax's overused laugh was annoying. Yes, I get it, Baby Groot is dumb. Hahaha.... Oh, now you're ugly shaming a character and playing it for jokes?\r\n\r\nOne note characters, a stupid plot of nothing interesting happening, and of course Starlord's father, a celestial, is nothing more than an evil being setting out to destroy the universe. Does Marvel not realize that villains can have other kinds of motivation?\r\n\r\nThe only two good things about this movie are the soundtrack and the fact that the events have no effect on the overarching MCU plot.

This film certainly has most of these elements but it doesn't work as well. Why? \r\n\r\nPerhaps its biggest short coming is its not especially cohesive. It builds and diffuses its much needed pace.This is not helped at all by  jumping between geographical locations and complicating the team dynamic. \r\n\r\nThe main character behaving like a medieval vassal, getting on his knees at one point to beg to keep a case, didn't impress either. Nor does, the at times, rather lame humour,that feels tacked on.\r\n\r\nOn the upside what remains is moderately entertaining but its not enough to really see this iteration shine.\r\n\r\nIn summary, not every film in any franchise can be a winner.

Guy Ritchie crafts an intriguing story about Winston Churchill’s team of highly skilled misfit soldiers recruited for the dirtiest missions against the Germans. This film combines historical drama with Ritchie's signature style, resulting in an engaging and action-packed experience.\r\n\r\nHenry Cavill stands out as the deranged leader of this unorthodox team, delivering a performance that balances madness with a fierce sense of duty. His character's unpredictable nature keeps the audience on edge.\r\n\r\nCavill stands out as the deranged leader of this unorthodox team, delivering a performance that balances madness with a fierce sense of duty. His character's unpredictable nature keeps the audience on edge. \r\n\r\nSimultaneously, the subplot involving two Allied spies embedded within the German ranks adds an exciting layer of espionage. Babs Olusanmokun and Eiza González deliver fantastic performances, navigating the perilous environment with a blend of cunning and bravery. \r\n\r\nHowever, not all elements of the film work seamlessly. The scenes featuring Winston Churchill are notably weaker, often disrupting the narrative flow and diminishing the film’s intensity. These moments feel out of place, detracting from the otherwise tight and focused storytelling. \r\n\r\nOn the technical front, the film excels with masterful cinematography and outstanding sound design. The visual style captures the gritty and chaotic nature of war while maintaining clarity during intense action sequences. The sound design immerses the audience in the film’s world, from the clamor of battle to the subtle tension of stealth operations. \r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare is a compelling addition to the war film genre, distinguished by its strong performances, engaging dual storylines, and technical prowess. While some scenes fall short, particularly those involving Winston Churchill, the film’s overall impact remains powerful. Guy Ritchie’s unique touch brings a fresh perspective to a historical narrative, making this film a must-watch for fans of action, history, and espionage.",

The unorthodox team carry out Operation Postmaster in early 1942, a daring attack on an island near Cameroon to disrupt the Nazis' U-boat resupply operation.\r\n\r\nHelmed by Guy Ritchie, \"The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\" (2024) is similar in plot to 1968’s “Attack on the Iron Coast,” which covered the St Nazaire Raid on the shore of German-occupied France, a raid that happened to take place 2.5 months after Operation Postmaster. Interestingly, the SOE were considered for heading that raid (in the aftermath of the great success of Operation Postmaster), but the mission was determined to be beyond the capabilities of the small-scale group.\r\n\r\nWhile the plot is reminiscent of “Attack on the Iron Coast,” the ‘hip,’ smirky style is along the lines of Tarantino’s “Inglourious Basterds,” mixed with bits of “The Dirty Dozen” and “Where Eagles Dare.” If you favor those movies, you’ll probably like this one, but it’s the least of ’em IMHO with the exception of the low-budget “Attack on the Iron Coast,” which was shot in B&W.\r\n\r\nDon’t get me wrong, this is a top-of-the-line production with a quality cast, including the likes of Henry Cavill, Alan Ritchson, Eiza González and Babs Olusanmokun. It just needed a little more human interest to draw me into the characters and care about the manic events.\r\n\r\nThe dynamic score brings to mind Spaghetti Westerns and includes a piece that rips off “Immigrant Song.”\r\n\r\nIt runs 2 hours, 2 minutes, and was shot at Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich, London, and Antalya on the southwest coast of Turkey.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-",

They manage to uproot his house and using some rudimentary sails he sets off in search of \"Paradise Falls\".

  "content": "Business executive \"Romy\" (Nicole Kidman) is initially impressed with the dog-handling skills of \"Samuel\" (Harris Dickinson) but when she discovers that he is to be an intern in her e-packaging company something else starts to draw her to the man. We already know that though happily enough married to \"Jacob\" (Antonio Banderas) she's not exactly fulfilled in the bedroom department, and \"Samuel\" seems to sense that it's an area that maybe he can help with. Were not just talking sex, here - oh. no. This is about a lady with fantasy of being dominated. About her surrendering control completely, and if you're going to do that at all, then why not this tall, handsome and mischievous bit of rough? Of course, like any addiction - it starts to get out of control as the relationship dynamic changes quite profoundly and others start to put two and two together. At times this is quite funny, and milk seems to play a central role from time to time, but as a cinematic version of something akin to tantric, it doesn't really work. Neither of these actors are afraid to get naked yet neither do, simultaneously, here. Indeed I'm sure I saw his black Calvin's shining from under the sheet when the intimacy consultant was at their busiest. I didn't need nudity to augment their unique sort of passion, but I did expect something way more natural, visceral even, and I didn't get it. It's filmed in such a disjointed and bitty fashion, there's no attempt to characterise or contextualise either of these people and in the end I felt like this was little better than a titillation for it's stars that didn't really aspire to engage those watching any more than age-related porn might. Dickinson isn't remotely charismatic and the premiss falls flat quickly, especially when the quite aggravating intervention of \"Esme\" (Sophie Wilde) rather summed the shallowness of the whole thing up. \"Eyes Wide Shut\" (1999) or \"Beach Rats\" (2017) showcase both their talents amidst a sexually charged environment far better: this is all forgettable, over-hyped, stuff.",

  "content": "Babygirl (2024) is yet another attempt at making a “provocative” drama that leans too much on surface-level shock value rather than compelling storytelling. The plot, if you can call it that, revolves around an imbalanced relationship dynamic that lacks any real emotional depth. There is no real buildup, no effort to make the audience care about these characters beyond their physical interactions, and certainly no originality. The film tries to be daring, but instead, it feels like a predictable series of events with little payoff.\r\n\r\nThe directing is uninspired, relying on overused shaky cam techniques that have no business in a drama like this. The cinematography does nothing to elevate the story, and at times, it feels like the camera is as lost as the script. The only real standout performance comes from Antonio Banderas, but he’s barely in the movie. Nicole Kidman, despite her talent, is stuck in a role that feels more about aesthetics than substance. And of course, we have the usual over-the-top praise for a “bold sexualized performance,” the same kind of overhyped reaction we saw with Demi Moore in Substance, as if established actors being in explicit scenes somehow qualifies as groundbreaking cinema.\r\n\r\nThe script is painfully weak, with dialogue that does little to make the characters feel real or relatable. The film spends too much time trying to push a message without taking the time to craft an engaging narrative. There are moments where it seems like it might go somewhere interesting, but then it falls back into the same repetitive themes. The pacing is another issue, dragging through unnecessary moments while rushing past anything that could have added depth.\r\n\r\nThe score is outright annoying. It doesn’t complement the film or enhance any of the scenes, it’s just there, adding to the discomfort in all the wrong ways. In the end, Babygirl tries to be provocative but lacks the intelligence or creativity to make an impact. It’s the kind of movie that confuses shock value with substance, leaving you wondering what the point of it all was.",

The movie is slower than a lot of movies in this genre but that does not make it boring and when the action starts it is measured (for a movie in this genre) and well done.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is a red thread, started by McCall’s first act of vigilantism, running through the movie he also performs a few on the side jobs as well during the movie. I like the vigilante stuff so for me this was some nice fillers to round off the movie.\r\n\r\nThe main thread pitches McCall against a real psychopathic Russian enforcer. No one can say that this movie did not have a well done bad guy. The role is quite well played. The guy is creepy to say the least. Not to mention violent of course but then so is McCall when the time is right.\r\n\r\nOne thing I liked with this movie is that McCall it is not one of the usual run around, look dangerous and clobber the bad guys in periodic outbursts of violence stereotypes. McCall is always calm, calculating, behaving intelligently and the baddies almost never realizes the mistake they just did until it is quite a bit too late.\r\n\r\nSure, the capacity of McCall to clobber the bad guys, usually without getting hurt himself, is bordering on superhuman but what the heck, it is fiction after all. Totally realistic movies are rarely fun, at least not movies of this genre. Also, the end fight where the baddies are more or less running around aimlessly and get taken out could have been better. Especially since the Russian mobster had shown quite a bit of intelligence up until that point. Having said that, I did like that it did not degenerate into the usual 20 minute shoot anything that moves nonsense. McCall is continuing his cold and calculating rampage through the unfortunate individuals on the wrong side and the various ways of disposing of them are rather creative.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I found this to be a rather entertaining movie. In one sense it is the usual vigilante stuff, which I happen to like, but in one sense it is not your normal run of the mill vigilante movie thanks to Denzel Washington’s cold, calculating and intelligent portrayal of McCall.",

It's a great showing from Denzel, not that that is a surprise given he is - alongside Leonardo DiCaprio - my favourite actor.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, it's a pretty standard vigilante action flick which probably goes on for slightly too long and features some forgettable, if solid, support cast/characters, the latter is especially true for the rather plain villains. The music is also standard, though does improve towards the end with the final score and end credit soundtrack.\r\n\r\nAll in all, a worthwhile watch thanks to Denzel.

That peaceful existence is compromised, though, when his colleague “Teri” (Chloë Grace Moretz) ends up in an altercation with a mysterious thug that puts her in hospital. Seeking to avenge this, his meticulous retribution soon attracts the attentions of the equally calculating “Teddy” (Martin Csokas) who seems to have an army at his disposal for “McCall” to find various ways to slaughter whilst both play a perilous cat and mouse game. Now there’s really precious little jeopardy here. We know how it’s going to end up, but along the way Washington and Csokas create quite an effective degree of menace aided by loads of dimly lit photography and fairly end-to-end brutality. We, of course, discover a little more of why our ninja has become a recluse - but that’s provided more for reference rather than to subsume us in a mire of sentiment and there’s actually very little here to distract us from an out and out revenge thriller that delivers well. It does miss that little jingle that used to accompany Edward Woodward when was “The Equalizer” but aside from that, allows Washington to thrive at his deadliest less-is-more.",

The rest of the cast are good, e.g. Rosemarie DeWitt, but <em>'Smile 2'</em> is very much Scott's movie.\r\n\r\nThe run time is perhaps a little longer than it needs to be, though to be honest that is only a minor criticism in the grand scheme of things. Much of what is onscreen helps nullify any potential (minor) pacing issues, the violence and gore is quite graphic but it is nicely done and is exactly what we want to see from a production of this sort, let's be real.\r\n\r\nI will say this does feature a few too many cheap jump scares, something I'm not a big fan of, but just like the above it isn't a notion that hinders the overall quality of the end result.

She's pretending to be a pop star, a story misstep that leads to some AI generated music that somehow sounds a decade or so dated.\r\n\r\nFilm could have been vastly improved if it was ~80 minutes of Scott being attack with a screwdriver, but that didn't happen and it's 2hours of mediocrity.

Now the apes have the upper hand and humanity is back in the caves. What I don't really get is why everything is in ruins and why there's an escalator in the middle of a forest full of zebras? Speech is crucial for communication, granted, but as the apes now thrive amidst the ruins of human construction I couldn't quite figure out why it was all decimated in the first place. Was there a war? Did I miss it? Anyway, Simian society still claims derivation from \"Caesar\" and in typical human fashion is just as divided. The apes live a peaceful life stealing the eagle's eggs from precariously perched nests so they can rear them themselves - and the eagles don't really seem to mind. The militaristic gorillas raid their village and drag them all to the seaside resort of \"Proximus\" where he is trying to break into an human, subterranean, vault. The raid caused havoc amongst the peaceable apes and left only \"Noa\" to try to free them. En route, he encounters \"Mae\" (Freya Allan) - an human who can speak, and upon arrival she befriends another talking person \"Trevathan\" (William H. Macy) who are both expected to help reach the treasures of the vault. She knows what's in there, and with the help of her new friends hopes to salvage what she was sent to retrieve - but without allowing any weapons inside to fall into enemy hands. It takes far too long to get going, this, but once we've established who is who and the story has kicked in, it's quite an exciting tale with some great visuals effects and just a little philosophy to keep it from falling into a trap of franchise mundanity. The acting isn't really up to much, but an enthusiastic effort from Kevin Durand as the menacing leader and some authentic looking acrobatics not seen since Johnny Weissmuller make for an entertaining episode in what is clearly a soap-style plot development where this is but an episode in a what happens next scenario.",

It starts off a new plot, obviously given how <em>'War for the Planet of the Apes'</em> concluded, and the new characters and their stories didn't really interest me.\r\n\r\nSome of the action is watchable, the military bunker angle is decent, the visual effects are strong (but we already knew that) and the bits directly with Noa and Raka are the film's best in my opinion. I don't, though, really recall much else about this and remember feeling quite nonplussed whilst watching; the literal final music-filled shot got me pumped though, out of nowhere. None of the cast (voice or otherwise) stand out, either.\r\n\r\nI'd have finished this franchise with the 2017 flick, but very much sounds like the filmmakers are planning another trilogy with this one. Hopefully I'll enjoy those (and the inevitable 2030s 'new' trilogy... 😏) more.",

Its story is rather formulaic and you do quickly feel like you have \"seen it all before\", in one form or another. \r\n\r\nHaving said this, I do not think Kingdom is a bad film. That would be unfair. Its CGI is top notch, as I said its story is basic but it does work, with well paced, varied action. Commendably, they even managed a little human/ape interest, which lifts the characters beyond being mere, cardboard cut outs.  \r\n\r\nIn summary, entertaining, watchable but really as far as I can see, nothing new is on offer here, either. Perhaps I'm being a little harsh but it would be nice, to see some genuine originality from Hollywood. They could do it once, why not now?",

  "content": "The Planet of the Apes prequel films have been nothing short of astonishing, and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes continues this trend with remarkable filmmaking. The decision to set this installment 300 years after the previous films, yet still focus on Caesar's legacy, was a brilliant move. It effectively addresses the absence of Andy Serkis and Caesar by weaving his influence throughout the narrative.\r\n\r\nOur protagonist Noah and his clan emerge as standout characters, bringing new life to the series. Their dynamic and struggles are compelling, adding depth to the narrative. Proximus Caesar serves as an effective villain, embodying the darker aspects of Caesar's legacy. His complex motivations and ruthless tactics provide a formidable challenge for Noah and his allies. \r\n\r\nMy biggest gripe with the film lies in the portrayal of the human element. There is a lack of clarity regarding humanity's current state within this franchise. More understanding or explanation of humanity's status would have enriched the story. For instance, scenes involving humans operating missile silos 300 years after their construction strain credibility without sufficient backstory. A deeper exploration of how humanity has adapted or regressed over the centuries would have added valuable context.\r\n\r\nDespite this flaw, the overall filmmaking remains top-notch. The visuals are stunning, with meticulous attention to detail in both the ape civilization and the post-apocalyptic landscapes. The special effects, particularly the motion capture work, are exceptional, bringing the apes to life with astonishing realism. \r\n\r\nKingdom of the Planet of the Apes is a fantastic addition to the series, successfully balancing new elements with the rich legacy of Caesar. While the human storyline could benefit from greater depth and clarity, the film excels in its primary focus on the apes and their evolving society. This installment delivers a satisfying conclusion to the saga, and I would be content if the series ended here, preserving the integrity of Caesar's legacy and the high standards set by these prequels.",

  "content": "> Probably the best live-shot Cinderella I've seen.\r\n\r\nDisney has done it again. Everybody knows Cinderella story and what this film gave was as it is with the help of modern CGI works. When I heard about the Disney's live-shot version is getting ready, I had a serious doubt, but not anymore. Nowadays, the filmmakers know how to pull it off a big budget movie with ease. Especially from Hollywood, if one market fails, it will raise in another as the recent example was 'Age of Extinction'. I am glad this movie met a great success despite it was not a surprise material as a story, but was as the quality of product.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs nearly for 100 minutes, that does not feel too long as the narration had a wonderful pace. Everything was awesomely handled by the director of 'Thor'. It's a new era of the live-shot movies, which borrows the stories from the fairytales, folklore and classical animations. Recent 'Maleficent' was one of the great examples and this film as well enters the book of triumph.\r\n\r\nLily James was very good, I haven't seen her much, because she's kind of a new actress in the spotlight. She's cute and adorable, I love to see her in many movies in the future. While Cate Blanchett, I never had any disbelief in her and she delivered it perfectly. An ideal movie for a family to watch at the weekend. I think children would love it, so at least watch it for them, with them.\r\n\r\n7/10",

  "content": "Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nI'm honestly concerned that this isn't a movie that anyone is going to watch again and again, but it's a solid watch, and a definite improvement over the 1950 animated classic, though I can't say this touches \"Ever After\" for me.\r\n\r\nThe original story was somewhat lacking, but had fantastic animation for the time, along with voice acting and writing parallel with the movies of its time.  I'm somewhat sad to say that is a fair difference in quality compared to modern standards.\r\n\r\nDisney very much kept this dumbed down for younger audiences, and I expect them to have more fun with scenes like \"lizard footman eats a fly\", but in the very least they steered away from realistic cg talking animals (a creepy factor in many of the live action remakes), though they do make a very specific nod to it at the beginning of the movie.\r\n\r\nWhile I do think they managed to improve on almost ever facet of the original, it certainly isn't without flaws.\r\n\r\nThe casting is all over the place, which, I'm sure, affected the odd character development.  Oddly, the less important characters, the men, in this case, are fine, I really have zero to say other than I rather like Nonso Anozie in anything he's in, and I did think the bit about \"Kit\" was a rather inspired thing.\r\n\r\nI understand that Kate Winslet has had a villainous kick the past few years, and she plays \"stuck up snoot\" very well, but seeing Helena Bonham Carter come in to give us \"the fairy godmother who ain't got time for dat\" really makes me wonder if they just weren't paying her enough to care.  It would have made more sense to let Winslet elevate the fairy godmother (one of the only things that really wasn't) and let Carter goes Bellatrix Lestrange as the Wicked Stepmother.\r\n\r\nSophie McShera did a marvelous job of making me hate her character, and Holliday Grainger kept making me see Katherine Heigl if we could keep her away from tanning beds, so they both did a marvelous job as wicked stepsisters (honestly, probably the best performances of the movie).\r\n\r\nFor some reason though, they made a very strange decision to make all the wicked women gingers, though not with a very convincing dye job.  I don't know if it was supposed to be representative of their tacky fashion and the ability to dye hair at the time, or if Disney really thinks gingers don't have a soul, but it was a blaring message, if illegible.\r\n\r\nWhat makes me think that they don't care at all is Lily James.  She's lovely, she did a good job with the role as written, and I'm dying to see her in anything else to see if any of the oddities were her, or she's done just as good as Winslet with the roles they were given.  \r\n\r\nCinderella is traditionally a \"fairest in the land\" look, given that it's the middle of Europe, I imagine northern was exotic once upon a time, or at least certain people thought so she is traditionally very blonde and very fair.  Lily James is neither (in this, despite some of the posters), so I thought they were taking a more Germanic look with a more honey colored hair....but it is also very oddly colored, and perhaps we wouldn't have notice if it wasn't for her very prominent BLACK eyebrows (which I have nothing against, I actually think they're lovely) which would have been simple enough to die to match.  Alternatively they could have abandoned blonde altogether (plenty of versions do).  It is just very odd to spend millions of dollars to do something purposefully (and repetitively) to make it look like they don't care and objectively make their movie worse.\r\n\r\nOverall, it's this sort of attitude that seeps into the movie at different points.  It could have been a masterpiece, but instead, everyone knows it's a guaranteed paycheck on the title alone and made something that ends up being rather average despite itself.",

  "content": "The best reviewer of Cinderella (2015) might be a child, for its message of kindness and courage wrapped in the Disney classic and illuminated through the eyes and smiles of Lily James (Ella), Richard Madden (\"Mr. Kit\"), Haley Atwell (Ella's mother) et al. calls out the beauty and virtue of child-like simplicity.  I think the great accomplishment of Lily James is her non-verbal communication of this central theme to \"have courage and be kind\" in the midst of the vicissitudes of life, just as Cate Blanchett's non-verbal communication of jaded bitterness masterfully supplies the melancholy contrast of devious conniving.   James brings love into her little world while Blanchett's legacy is her two spoiled rotten daughters played marvelously by Holliday Granger and Sophie McShera.  This remake brings a lot of humor to help get the message across-- primarily in Helen Botham Carter, the hairy Godfather, I mean, the fairy Godmother-- whose quirky kindness charms and delights.  The animals too, as Ella's constant companions, add to the humor.  The casting in this film utilizes the actors' talents quite well. I found myself watching this over and over again, at least parts of it, for the sheer joy of its message.  In a world of negativity, there is something very real about simplicity and purity, if only in a love fantasy.  \r\nA final note must be added about the music-- it contributes its share to the film's message most beautifully.",

(It gets a 6/10 on the Dragon-Scale, because the Jabberwocky has an amazing design and it's walking looks so off-putting.)_\r\n\r\nAlice... who hasn't heard of or watched it at some point? This is a sequel to the original, Alice is now 19 when she returns to Wonderland. Which... she has no obvious memories of, which, for an adventure with the scope she undertook when she was younger, I find a little hard to believe. \r\n\r\nShe never acknowledges having any memories of Wonderland until the end of the movie. Which again, strikes me as odd, because even if she would write off her earlier adventure as a dream, you'd still acknowledge having seen it all before, right? Perhaps I'm just overthinking this, but even subconsciously you'd recognize some of the things you see... right?\r\n\r\nIn any case, Wonderland has gotten a lot darker and has gotten a healthy CGI coating. Which, might not seem super today, but I think it gives everything a very 'this is not reality' vibe. Which works in Underland's favor in my opinion, it's chaotic, lacking in conventional logic and absolutely infused with magic. And it's bizarre denizens all immediately pop out at you, with many strange shapes, weird behavioral tics and tend to defy the laws of physics.\r\n\r\nThe story is a coming of age story, which is immediately set up in the beginning as Alice is forced into a marriage with someone she barely knows. Something not uncommon for the time it is set in. And during the movie she figures out who she is, someone who'll do things her own way, prophecies and expectations be damned. Despite not being the easiest way, everything still falls into place eventually and the prophecy fulfills itself.\r\n\r\nWhen she comes back to her reality, she turns down her chosen fiancé, gives everyone she's encountered at her engagement party some snappy one-liners, which, they all seem to take in stride. She then takes up her father's passion to establish brave new trade-routes all the way to China. Which, perhaps feels a little _too_ easy. (Considering everyone was calling her father insane for his plans, which she promptly takes a step further.) But then again, this is a story with talking rabbits, a hookah smoking caterpillar and playing card knights, so perhaps I shouldn't take it so seriously.\r\n\r\nAll in all, a fun watch with a satisfying payoff in the end!",

  "content": "It started off as rioting. But right from the beginning you knew this was different...\r\n\r\n28 Days Later is directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland. It stars Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris, Megan Burns, Brendan Gleeson and Christopher Ecclestone. Music is by John Murphy and cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle.\r\n\r\nWhen animal liberation activists break into the Cambridge Primate Research Center, they come across a scientist who tells them that to release these chimps would be insane. They have been injected with a test serum known as \"Rage\", and it's highly contagious and spreads easily and quickly. Ignoring the warnings, one of the activists opens a cage and is attacked and bitten by a chimp and rage quickly spreads among the group...\r\n\r\n28 days later... \r\n\r\nThe amazing thing with Danny Boyles's 28 Days later is that although it owes a huge debt to the likes of George Romero's zombie films, and John Wyndham and Richard Matheson's writings, it still feels fresh and exciting. Film is quintessentially British, as evidenced by the rightly lauded use of a depopulated London for the starting point to the terror, yet there's an earthiness to our small band of survivors. These are flawed characters that are ill equipped to deal with the infected implosion, there's nothing remotely Hollywood about these people or the landscapes that frame them (CG is minimal, where hand-held digital cameras are the order of the day). \r\n\r\nThere's a realistic feel factor that is rarely seen in other films of this ilk. Yep, sure there's implausibilities, but with the infected creatures running at a fair old clip, becoming scary creations in a stark stripped back land, there's too much fun being had - and nervous tension being burnt - to even begin to start nit-picking. Besides, the last quarter alone is a lesson in energy fuelled horror as the survivors, having seemingly found a safe house, find that monsters aren't merely confined to the infected human kind. It's a cracker-jack of a finale, bloody and bloody frantic, all backed by Murphy's simple but totally potent musical arrangements.\r\n\r\nIt's easy to see why America made it a monster hit at the box office, after just making a small profit in the UK, film went to America and made it big. Americans, you have to feel, enjoyed watching something raw in a sub-genre of horror that was at the time reliant on Romero rediscovering his mojo. Worldwide the film made over $70 million in profit, and those are the kinds of figures that speak volumes. The success ensured a sequel would follow, where Boyle and Garland bowed out of the main chairs and into producers roles for \"28 Weeks Later\". It's not as raw as \"Days\", but it's gorier and itself also a fine \"infected\" horror movie, and certainly a worthy follow up to what Boyle and Garland clinically created in 2002.\r\n\r\nA great cast and premise get down and dirty In a sharply executed infected based horror. 8.5/10",

  "content": "\"28 Days Later\" is a British horror movie directed by Danny Boyle and starring Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris. The film tells the story of Jim (Cillian Murphy), a courier who wakes up from a coma to find London abandoned and overrun by rage-infected humans.\r\n\r\nThe film's opening sequence is one of the most iconic and powerful in horror movie history. Jim wakes up in a hospital room to find the world he knew has disappeared, and the eerily deserted streets of London make for an unsettling and ominous backdrop.\r\n\r\nThe film is expertly paced, with a gradual buildup of tension that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The infected humans are terrifying, fast-moving, and relentlessly violent, and the film's use of sound and lighting only heightens their impact.\r\n\r\nOne of the standout features of \"28 Days Later\" is the excellent acting by Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris. Murphy delivers a convincing performance as Jim, a man struggling to survive in a world gone mad, while Harris shines as Selena, a tough survivor who has learned to navigate the dangers of the new world.\r\n\r\nThe film's themes of survival, loss, and the resilience of the human spirit are powerful and thought-provoking. As Jim and Selena make their way through the deserted streets of London, they encounter a range of characters, each with their own story of survival and loss.\r\n\r\nThe film's cinematography and visual effects are also top-notch, with haunting and memorable shots of a deserted London and intense action sequences that will leave you breathless.\r\n\r\nOverall, \"28 Days Later\" is a masterful horror movie that sets the bar high for the genre. The film's excellent acting, pacing, and visuals make for a truly unforgettable experience. I would rate \"28 Days Later\" a 8 out of 10.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWritten and Reviewed by RSOliveira",

There's not a soul to be seen, anywhere. He can't spend the entire film wandering about naked, so finds some scrubs and goes exploring - gradually gleaning information about the plague that led to the evacuation of the cities and to his current isolation. It's not as if he had anything to do with the release of this virus, but he now has to deal with it's consequences. Luckily he encounters \"Selena\" (Naomie Harris) and \"Mark\" (Noah Huntley) who save him from a marauding mob (think \"Omega Man\" from 1971) and their risky adventures begin trying to find what's left of humanity and hopefully safety. A wind-up radio broadcast gives them some hope, and off they travel with newfound friends \"Frank\" (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter \"Hannah\" (Megan Burns) in their black taxi (so of course, it takes a circuitous route) to Manchester. Their arrival visits tragedy on the small group but also introduces them to the last bastions of military security - under the command of \"Maj. West\" (Christopher Eccleston). Pretty swiftly they realise that very little of this new scenario is much safer for them and their thoughts turn to leaving...! This is quite an effective apocalyptic tale of corrupted science and morals and uses, for most of the first section of the film, dialogue sparingly allowing the eerie photography and soundtrack of a largely abandoned London to set the scene for us. Thereafter the writing isn't the best, but the benign sense of menace exuded by Eccleston and the confidence of both Harris and the young Burns work well at giving us an almost claustrophobic sense of peril, especially as we drift to a denouement that is cleverly constructed to make us think. It's bleak and threatening at times, not without the odd dark humour and in the end presents us with quite an intriguing look at humanity in many of it's less attractive, more visceral, guises. Danny Boyle and Alex Garland keep a few twists for the tale at the end, too, and Murphy holds it all together in an understatedly potent fashion.",

Also, the production design and creature design was great.\r\n\r\nA movie doesn't have to be restricted to either being \"the best\" or \"horrible.\" The theater I saw it in was packed, the audience was responsive and seemed to be loving it, and I myself enjoyed it.\r\n\r\nI didn't really play the games, but I was definitely engaged in the lore of some of the MatPat Game Theory videos I saw. And I could tell from audience reactions that there were some cool things in the movie if you knew the games. That's not a negative, to be clear. It's always really cool when filmmakers put things in movies that true fans would catch and geek-out about.\r\n\r\nAs far as being a viewer who didn't really play the games, I enjoyed the movie. And while I think knowing the games/lore would have definitely enhanced my enjoyment and enthusiasm, I wouldn't say it lacks as a movie or that the games are \"required viewing\" for those who haven't played them. Everything's explained pretty well.\r\n\r\nAs far as the horror aspect goes, it is PG-13; I saw some reviews complaining about the lack of gore... It's PG-13. C'mon guys.\r\nBut, that being said, I thought they still did a good job with the horror elements that were present.\r\n\r\nI also really liked the trio of main characters. I thought Josh Hutcherson, Piper Rubio, and Elizabeth Lail all did a good job.\r\nAlso, I'm glad Josh Hutcherson is back. I hope he'll continue to be in more movies.",

I'm afraid the presence of Matthew Lillard never helps a film, and here is no different - this is just a rather nonsensical attempt at a spooky mystery that certainly has nothing to make you jump. Rubio is actually quite decent, but there's isn't enough else happening to compensate for the very slow build up, surfeit of dialogue and frankly rather silly underlying premiss. I suppose as Halloween gets bigger and bigger, we are going to get more and more of these mediocre offerings - but despite it's more prominent cast, this just belongs on the Horror channel at 2am.",

In every universe FNaF has, there is a William, and he kills, and I feel like they swung and missed the ball with William a little. If they are able to make a second film, I hope they explore William more.

To get this out of the way, Jim Henson's company did a fantastic job bringing the animatronic horrors to life. All the animatronic suits look phenomenal; it looks like they ripped them straight from the game. The Easter egg characters also looked really good. Jim Henson's done an awesome job! The actors for the film were great as well: Josh Hutcherson, Elizabeth Lail, and Matthew Lillard. All great actors that fit their roles perfectly. I am a little sad that Matthew Lillard's role, William Afton, didn't have that much screen time. For being the main villain of the whole film, he only had a big twist at the end. Speaking of the big twist, Matthew Lillard played William Afton perfectly; I can't imagine someone else playing the role. He tuned into who William Afton was so well. The line \"I always come back\" didn't really fit; at that moment, how does he know he will come back? The lack of scares in the film and the fact that Mr. Cupcake gets the most kills in the whole film are insane to me. FNaF is a jumpscare game, and this film focused more on the human story, which is fine; I would've liked more than a few jumpscares. I also don't care for the animatronics being all friendly; their kids are trapped in robots. Unless those kids were born killing, I can't see how people can be mad at the animatronics for being friendly.",

  "content": "So here's good old \"Arthur\" (Jason Momoa) sitting around the house playing nursemaid to his young son with his wife \"Mera\" (Amber Heard) whilst all in his underwater kingdom is peaceful. Well not for long! \"Black Manta\" (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is still a tad narked after the last film (five years ago!) and now armed with an useful geek \"Dr. Shin\" (Randall Park) sets out to discover a secret trident that will enable him to destroy \"Atlantis\" altogether and maybe also release the long captive \"Kordax\" (wasn't that the stuff they used to make telephone cables from?) to help make his revenge complete. Initially hopelessly outgunned by his nemesis's sonic gun, he has to resort to the drastic step of rescuing his imprisoned brother \"Orm\" (Patrick Wilson) - whom you may recall he was instrumental in deposing and incarcerating in the first place; and hoping that he will join forces with them, \"Atlanna\" (Nicole Kidman) and \"King Nereus\" (an almost unrecognisable Dolph Lundgren). With battles lines drawn the films goes from \"Narnia\" to \"Middle Earth\" via the \"Lost World\" and even a bit of \"Ice Station Zebra\" for a series of ploddingly slow and disappointing set-piece adventures. To be fair, the last half hour does lift the pace a little, but by then I'm not sure if it wasn't all just a rather too late. Momoa is trying very hard here, but he's no Dwayne Johnson, and even the dulcets of John Rhys-Davies as the \"Brine King\" - with or without his claw - can't really raise this from it's pretty weak and feeble doldrums. Of course it looks good, loads of quality CGI and visual effects, but the story is light and overly strung out for two hours that really did feel more like two days at times. It's harmless fodder for Christmas cinema with very little to actually dislike about it - it's just the latest in a series of equally forgettable super-hero films that I suspect will leave no impact at all in the snow afterwards.",

That is until now, because <em>'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'</em> isn't any good. I admittedly only mildly enjoyed the original - I had to watch a recap because I had forgotten basically everything about it since viewing it in May 2021.\r\n\r\nThe cast are hit-and-miss. I have no negatives for Jason Momoa, he is more than satisfactory from start to end. I did find his eyes distracting (wait, not like that) with the effects used, I don't remember them being so in-your-face (pardon the pun) in the 2018 film - but I could be totally misremembering, to be fair. Either way, Momoa is the obvious star.\r\n\r\nYahya Abdul-Mateen II's character is one I can barely remember, but the actor himself is good - I am a fan. The rest of those onscreen are fine acting-wise, but I really wasn't invested in any of them whatsoever; from Patrick Wilson (especially) to Amber Heard to Dolph Lundgren to Nicole Kidman. I think it's their character designs that I find most uninteresting.\r\n\r\nI am kinda looking forward to seeing what James Gunn and Peter Safran produce with the DC Universe come 2025, on paper with those two in charge it should be a success - just depends how much so, I guess.",

  "content": "I would say that this movie is pretty much the kind of movie that I expected it to be. That being said I think it was a bit softer than I hoped it to be. I think that, again, the Hollywood plonkers have opted to make a movie that got a more palate rating (to them and their cash registers) than what it should have been. It is not as obvious as with Robocop and a few other movies but the feeling is there.\r\n\r\nIt is still a fairly entertaining movie. It is of course yet another special effects movie and as such it does not disappoint. It differs from a lot of the usual special effects movies in that the effects are pretty down to Earth in a bizarre way. We are not talking about superheroes or near magical technologies here but instead we have a devastated landscape, scrounged together equipment and a totally ludicrous desire to blow up the last remains of human civilisation. The bizarre vehicle designs and the totally ridicules behaviour of a lot of people in this movie is alone worth watching it to be honest.\r\n\r\nAs with the previous Mad Max movies this one stretches the bounds of reality (I hope) when it comes to human behaviour and how they waste the few precious resources, specifically gasoline and bullets, that remains after the apocalypse. It provides some spectacular scenery but it also puts a bit of “what the f…” feeling to it all. Not that this part is not expected from a Mad Max movie though.\r\n\r\nWhat I think was my largest let-down in the movie was the Mad Max character itself. To me he is supposed to be a real bad-ass. In this movie he was not really that impressive. He certainly was far from the original Mad Max character in my opinion and was really overshadowed by the Furiosa character. I could have lived with that if this character would have been really impressive but she was not. She was cool but she was still underwhelming when comparing to anything in the original bad-ass Mad Max universe. I would say that Tina Turner and Mel Gibson still rules!\r\n\r\nStill it is a decent futuristic, apocalyptic action movie, maybe not living up to this old movie geeks expectations, but not at all a wasted movie evening. The sound track of the Blu-ray certainly gave my subwoofer an exercise as well.",

  "content": "**The following is a long form review that I originally wrote in 2015.**\r\n\r\nI’ll keep this’n somewhat brief, because I only saw the movie once and it was a few days ago now. Some time later on though, I will post a spoiler talk that goes into greater depth. For now though, enjoy this spoiler free review of _Mad Max: Fury Road_!\r\n\r\nThe number one complaint I’ve been seeing about _Fury Road_ is that there’s not much of a story. I would respond by saying, there might not be as much story as you could **want**, but there is certainly as much as you could **need**. The plot isn’t deep, or complex, or intricate, or philosophical. but it’s there, and it makes sense. Just last year, _John Wick_ showed us that you can get away with a pretty thin premise, if you work hard enough on building a thick, palpable world. And the world of _Fury Road_ is something else entirely, I can see why people aren’t blown away by the story, but the world is incredible.\r\n\r\nThere has been much discussion as to whether Max himself, or his cohort Furiosa (played by Charlize Theron) is the star of the film. I would argue that neither of them are. Director George Miller is. This is his vision. Warner Brothers took a big risk when they handed a 70 year old man nearly two hundred million dollars to revitalise his franchise which has been dead for 30 years, then get out of the way and let him do his thing. But it paid off. _Fury Road_ is more of an “experience” than most movies are, it just happens to be a great film, too.\r\n\r\nThe stunt work and visual effects deserve praise all to themselves. According to the filmmakers, roughly ten percent of all the effects were done with CGI. The other NINETY are practical, and it oozes with that spectacle. You really can feel the maximum force of the future sitting in that theatre, which is a rare and unexpected pleasure.\r\n\r\nIt’s my highest rated film of 2015 thus far, in fact, it’s one of only five films I’ve given more than 4 stars in the past five years. So please don’t take the recommendation lightly when I ask you all to go out and support this movie. Just make sure you do it in the biggest, best quality cinema you can, because this latest entry to the _Mad Max_ franchise is worth it.\r\n\r\n91%\r\n\r\n-_Gimly_",

  "content": "When I saw the reviews for this movie my first thought was \"Every critic has lost their minds... even me.\"\r\n\r\nThe story is about a post-apocalyptic wasteland - the fight for survival has twisted the remnants of mankind, turning most into mad, vicious gangs. In this chaotic world two rebels may be able to restore order while seeking their own forms of redemption: Max, a man who just wants peace after losing his wife and child and Furiosa - who thinks finding her childhood home is the answer.\r\n\r\nWhat a lovely day to be talking about Mad Max: Fury Road, because the trailers and the reviews for this movie have been off the walls mad. I mean five out of five star's! wow, just wow. The last Mad Max film came out in 1985, so it's a been a long time and so was this movie, as development took a long time. So I was curious and a bit shady for this movie, by seeing if George Miller (The director of the original films) was going to bring to the table. Now after seeing the movie and having a long thought about it, this movie is freaking awesome, no actually this is the best action movie of the year and probably the decade.\r\n\r\nGeorge Miller goes back to his roots and he doesn't disappointment. After all these years later he's still got it. He filmed all the action scenes with care and effort, because most of the action in this movie are mostly practical effects and that right there shows that Miller is going back to old school of action, and it's perfect. You are the man Miller!\r\n\r\nThe movie itself is mad and I do mean freaking insane. There's a guy in this movie who plays a flamethrower electric guitar on top of a speed vehicle and all through out the movie he was rocking it out. I don't know why, but little things like that made this movie so mad that it's enjoyable.\r\n\r\nTom Hardy as Max Rockatansky was good, I mean he wasn't as good as Mel Gibson but I still think he did a great job. Most of the time Max doesn't talk all that much, I mean most of he's lines are \"huh\", or \"Water\", but he has a couple of lines in the movie and it sounded epic all the time.\r\n\r\nCharlize Theron (as Furiosa) is basically the main character and Max is the supporting character. Charlize Theron was like a female version of Max in a way, because her character steels the whole show as her character is a strong female bad-ass that kicks so much ass that it's very rare in action movies today to do that. Now think of all the strong female character's in past action movies, well that's Furiosa right here.\r\n\r\nThe action scenes can be best describe as incredible and freaking crazy. The stunt work used during the movie was f**king amazing. There actually used practical effects mixed with CGI during the action scenes which looked so good and much better than over using effect's to make something look incredible and I know they used some CGI for scenes where it needed it, because it would be too dangerous or impossible to do, but for the most part it's all practical effect's. NOW THIS IS HOW ACTION MOVIES SHOULD BE DONE! THANK YOU MAD MAX: FURY ROAD FOR DOING THIS!!! Okay, I had to get that out there and sorry for shouting.\r\n\r\nImmortan Joe (played by Hugh Keays- Byrne), and yes he was in the first Mad Max movie, but here he plays a different villain this time and a menacing one as well. He was like a mix of Dark Vader and Sweet Tooth from Twisted Metal (Video Game). He was awesome villain that didn't take sh*t from anyone and always looked like he was going to cause a whole lot of trouble every time he's on screen.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography was just beautiful and some of the best looking shoots so far this year. I can't believe I'm saying that for a action movie that's been in development for years and it payed off perfectly. This is very rare for this to happen as a lot of movie franchises that have been in the making for years and years would normally come out to late where every body just lost interest and give up waiting, and the movie itself would turn out not so good, but here is much different. This movie broke new grounds of coming out late but still being a amazing thrill ride.\r\n\r\nThe other women in the movie know as the five wives are not just there to look pretty and be saved by any man, no they kicked ass in the movie and they actually did something. The five wives were strong women and this isn't just a mans movie, I mean most of the movie is the women kicking ass and being awesome. They kick more ass then Max ever did. That's why I got to give this movie praise for that.\r\n\r\nNow for the problems: I tried to look for things that didn't quite work for the movie and to be honest I couldn't find anything that I thought wasn't good. Well there was some slow parts in the movie but the slow parts where the action clams down for now it fills it's time with character development and back story and it worked.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: Forget \"Pitch Perfect 2\", this is the movie you should see at cinema. As a movie reviewer myself who wants action movies to be more then turn your brain off and enjoy whatever slob mess there in front of the screen, but what I want is a movie experience that I can look back on and say \"Now that, was one heck of a movie.\"",

  "content": "Unlikely, but it is possible.\r\n\r\n12 Angry Men is directed by Sidney Lumet and adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose. The cast is headed by Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb. The film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or innocence of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. Except for two short scenes at the beginning and end of the film, it's filmed entirely on one set, that of the jury deliberation room.\r\n\r\nSweaty, gritty, claustrophobic - all words that sit snugly in the context of Lumet's excellently crafted deconstruction of 12 men trying to arrive at one verdict in the case of a Puerto Rican youth on trial for the murder of his father. The evidence appears overwhelming, there's witnesses, a murder weapon and motive, the boy is surely on his way to the electric chair. 11 of the men are convinced he's guilty, only one man stands alone, Henry Fonda's juror number 8, who refuses to turn in a vote of guilty until the evidence and facts are discussed at length. As the others rail against him and tempers get frayed, juror number 8 prompts the others to examine their own prejudices and commitment to justice.\r\n\r\nA lesson in tight direction and editing, and with performances to match, 12 Angry Men is quite simply not to be missed by those seeking to venture into classic cinema. 9/10",

  "content": "Twelve jurors are sent to their deliberating room after hearing the evidence in a murder trial. It's potentially the hottest day of the year as this collection of white, male, individuals take their seats around the table and wait for foreman Martin Balsam - none of the characters have names, here - to call them to order. A first vote is in order - it's a slam dunk - the accused is obviously guilty - 11-1! Henry Fonda is the dissenter. What has he seen that the others missed? What has he not seen that the others have understood? What now ensues is one of the best written and characterised, compelling, dramas cinema has ever produced. Excellent efforts from Lee J. Cobb, in particular, but from all concerned allow the tension to positively leap from the screen at us. This story gradually fills us in with the details of the crime, with the statements of the witnesses and, initially at any rate, illustrates just how cursorily many of these men treat this case. They want to get home for dinner, for a baseball game, to their wives and children. The fact that they are considering the life and death of an eighteen year old man seems tangential to the inconvenience they are facing or to the value they place on this man's survival. Reginald Rose's original screenplay takes us through the whole gamut of human bigotries and intolerances with everything from ageism, racism, respect and sexism rearing their ugly heads as the tension in their discussions rises and the true nature of these characters starts to emerge. Timidity, assertion, rationality - all are on display as these men start with a position that they may well not end up with. Ninety minutes seems far too short - but it works very well, rarely coming up for air - but what will their verdict be? Big screen if you can. Not because the scenario (a jury room) needs it - but there is so much energy and vitality in this film, that is just the best way to appreciate it a strong cast who put their all into their roles - and it works!",

  "content": "**A very well-made film, with great actors.**\r\n\r\nAs a non-American myself, it's a little tricky for me to understand how well this justice system works. Don't get me wrong, but in my country it is not usual to resort to this type of trials, where the decision depends largely on the lawyers' ability to convince a group of jurors. Here, the decision depends more on the judge, or on a collective of judges. Resorting to a jury trial is provided for in Portuguese law, but must meet a tight set of prerequisites, which turns out to be a very unusual option.\r\n\r\nSo to understand this movie better I had to go read a little bit about how a real life jury trial works. And this is where my doubts about this film are greatest. Is it really a film that respects what really happens in the room where a jury deliberates what sentence to pass? Throughout the film, it is quite clear that the trial did not go well, mainly due to a largely ineffective defense and incapable of securing the interest of the accused (something difficult to admit, especially in a case of capital punishment). Could the jury have done anything about it other than pass sentence? I confess, I don't know. I leave this to the jurists, lawyers and people who can understand more about the subject.\r\n\r\nThe film is a bit like one of those plays that ends up being taken to the cinema: the action takes place overwhelmingly in the same environment, quite confined, and with a limited group of characters who interact with each other and dialogue. Dialogues are an essential part of the film and they are not always nice. It is noted that there is an increase in tensions, and if there are several jurors interested in dismissing the matter and leaving, this changes little by little, as the details are analyzed and doubts about the trial increase. It is a frankly well-written, well-directed film (Sidney Lumet's best) and with a strong and competent cast where Henry Fonda assumes an unequivocal role, giving us one of the best works of his career. Also, Lee J. Cobb deserves a round of applause for the way he interprets and acts, in a deeply caustic character. Every actor has the time and material he needs to do a good job, and they all did.\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, it is an extremely discreet film, largely due to the low budget it was limited to. However, it is one of those films that proves that it is not necessary to have infinite money to do an excellent job. The setting is very believable, but where Lumet shined was in his clever use of cinematography and shooting angles to amplify feelings of confinement or discomfort. Sometimes, the camera gets so close to the actors' faces that we can see how much the excessive heat and subject tension is getting on their nerves.",

At the same time, he struggled with memories, but don't we all?\r\n\r\nAs the viewer, we're left to determine the morality of the happiness of millions versus the freedom of one. We're also left to consider whether Truman's cage was better than his freedom. A child born into a system that doesn't have a great track record or a life of relative safety with no knowledge of the cage.\r\n\r\nThe viewer also has to determine the sturdy nature of reality. What is reality besides our perception of it? What's real to Jim or to Bob? Are the things that are real to them real to me if I've never seen or heard about them?\r\n\r\nBeyond the philosophical questions the movie poses, the film itself is solid. Jim Carrey pulls off the part wonderfully. He's more than just a comedian, although he can bring the humor the instant the scene needs it. The supporting cast fell right in line.\r\n\r\nThe pacing may be a little slow early on for many viewers, but that is remedied once the action begins to pick up.\r\n\r\nIf you want something light and silly, go watch something else by Carrey.",

What can he do, though? Every attempt to \"escape\" is thwarted and we know he is terrified of the water... Will he get to the truth? Easily Carrey's best role in my book, as he plays the good natured but slightly vacuous character whom we see evolve into someone much more capable than many - including his puppet-master - think possible. It's a comically savage indictment on the routine nature of the life so many people go through as one year follows another with little, if any, change to the safe daily regimen. The writing allows Carrey to deliver a plausibly characterful effort that's entertaining and engaging and hats also ought to come of to his on-screen wife (Linney) who presumably sacrifices quite a lot for her art and watches the man she cares for become a bit of a personality car crash.

This premise alone sets it apart in cinematic history. Truman felt real, relatable, and honestly, just amazing.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this movie special is how unique the story is. Back in 1998, the idea of someone’s life being filmed without them knowing was way ahead of its time. The film captured and critiqued a cultural shift before it fully unfolded. Watching Truman figure out that his whole world is fake and trying to break free is equal parts heartbreaking and inspiring. It really makes you think about how much of your life is influenced by the world around you and what’s actually real.\r\n\r\nThe choice of location was genius, the town Truman lives in, Seahaven, is picture-perfect. It was filmed in Seaside, Florida, and honestly, it looks like something out of a postcard. But that’s the point, it feels like the kind of place you'd dream of but quickly realize is too good to be true, just like Truman’s life. The way they shot the movie is genius too. Cinematographer Peter Biziou masterfully used unconventional angles, hidden-camera perspectives, and subtle vignetting to make you feel like you’re watching Truman through the eyes of the people spying on him.\r\n\r\nThematically, The Truman Show hits hard. It’s about the constructed realities we live in, whether imposed by media, society, or even ourselves. It explores what it means to live authentically and the cost of breaking free from comfort and illusion. And honestly, how many movies make you question the nature of your own life?\r\n\r\nBeyond the story, the film’s legacy is remarkable. It anticipated a world of mass surveillance and reality TV, making it more than just a movie, it’s a cultural touchstone. Even now, its themes feel fresh and unsettling, like it was made for today.\r\n\r\nIt’s not just an entertaining watch but a thought-provoking experience that stays with you long after the credits roll. Whether it’s your first time watching or a revisit, The Truman Show feels like a mirror to our times.",

  "content": "**A long form review originally posted in 2010:**\r\n\r\nMarking the beginning of the latest Marvel franchise, _The Avengers_, is Jon Favreau's _Iron Man_.\r\n\r\nI'm quite fond of Super Hero movies, I don't love them to the same extent that I do the slasher or psychological thriller genres, but they do hold a small place in my heart all to themselves. I'm pretty pumped for this whole \"Avengers\" thing to come to fruition, 'cause honestly it's all been great so far, starting with Iron Man, whom Robert Downey Jr. (_Natural Born Killers, Gothika, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, A Scanner Darkly, Zodiac, Sherlock Holmes, Due Date_) portrays, and incredibly so.\r\n\r\nIt's important to set yourself a starting point. More specifically, what I mean is, a reason. Batman's parents were murdered, and his home was destroyedby crime; The Punisher's whole family was murdered in front of him and he big-time snapped; characters like the X-Men and the Fantastic 4 are defending themselves and end up having a penchant for world-saving. Those are all fine, and so long as you have one, I'm happy. But I really kind of like Tony Stark's reason for becoming Iron Man... He's a dick. That's why. He's a dick that supplies the world with the most lethal weapons in existence, and they take lives left, right and centre. Then, he's put through the world where they get used, and finally is told by the person who helped him escape that world, not to waste his life. He believes he is still alive for a reason, he decides that reason is to become a dick that is intent on privatising world peace. Which I think makes perfect sense.\r\n\r\nThat may have come across as sarcasm, but I was deadly serious. Tony Stark becomes Iron man, and that's why. It works fantastically. We then get to see all the incarnations of his suit, how difficult it was to make, what it runs on, the technology, everything. And I'm a huge fan of back story, which Iron Man delivers.\r\n\r\nIt's sort of the antithesis of DC's _Batman Begins_. Though they're both young adults that come from money with no family, a British butler (although Iron man's butler Jarvis was transformed into AI for the film [he was an actual person in the comics]), they have a board of directors take care of their family's billionaire business until they're ready to eventually take the reins, they both become \"____ Man\" and go about saving the innocent, not through superpowers but technology. I'm sure I could go on. But they're also incredibly different. Where Batman is a total bad ass, the gothic unknown defender of the night that uses fear as a weapon to protect his home town, and yet refuses to kill; Iron Man is a bright, shiny, loud attention grabber, who goes all international to fight crime, he wants the world to know he's Iron Man and his enemies are totally lame, so no wonder he has no qualms about killing! Batman's secret identity, Bruce Wayne, is an angsty tosser, that tries way to hard. But Tony Stark, is a witty, brilliant inventor, who has basically harnessed all of Batman's training, strength, weapons, vehicles and flight, improved them, and put them in to a single suit. So though I personally prefer Batman as a hero, I prefer Tony Stark as a character.\r\n\r\nThe interaction between Stark and Pepper Potts, played by Gwyneth Paltrow (_Se7en, The Talented Mr. Ripley, The Royal Tenenbaums, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow_) was incredible. It just goes to show what good casting can achieve, even in an action flick, the dialogue is hilarious and clever. Is it possible for a Super Hero movie to be a bad Super Hero film but a great film? I guess it is.\r\n\r\nThe antagonists are lacking to say the least, and their dispatching leaves even more to be desired. Which is normally not too huge when you get the rest so perfect, unfortunately, it's a comic book film, about Super Heroes, and Super Villains. They fight one another over and over, in fact that's pretty much what the comics are about in their entirety, so it's quite a major short coming. That being said, it's really the only one that _Iron Man_ has. In a way though, they're a similar comparison to the latest Batman films again; Iron Monger and Whiplash are flashy, but disappointing, where The Joker, Two-Face, Scarecrow and Ra's al Ghul are top notch as bad guys. Whereas Ironman's Obadiah Stane and Ivan Vanko were great characters, but Batman's The Joker is only seen in his villain persona, and Harvey Dent, Jonathan Crane and Henri Ducard are nothing more than vessels for their alter-egos.\r\n\r\nAll that aside, the film is just plain good, and you don't need to be a fan of Iron Man, Super Heroes or comics in general to enjoy _Iron Man_.\r\n\r\n82%\r\n\r\n-Gimly",

It was the first comic book movie in a long time to integrate the fantastical nature of superheroes and supervillains into a real world setting with consequences. It also showed how great of a filmmaker Jon Favreau is and rebooted the career of Robert Downey Jr.\r\n\r\nFor all this, Iron Man is a fantastic movie, still one of the best MCU films. It's so much fun to watch. Yet it displays a lot of intelligence, exploring the internal dilemma of a man profiteering off war when faced with the harsh reality that he is part of a system that corrupts absolutely.",

Robert Downey Jr. is terrific as the titular character, who is a blast to watch throughout - love the design! The plot is very entertaining, I like how it tells the story; simply, but very effectively. Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges and Gwyneth Paltrow, meanwhile, all add to the film with good performances.\r\n\r\nThe special effects are very neat, as are all the action sequences. I will say the score isn't the strongest, at least in terms of what I'd expect from this sorta film. I wouldn't say it's bad per se, just not as spectacular as it could've (should've?) been; especially with someone like Ramin Djawadi composing. I love a film with great music, so hopefully that improves as I watch the MCU expand.\r\n\r\nI know, I'm extremely late to this particularly party but happy to finally begin watching.",

  "content": "**An excellent film, which only loses a little in some details related to the writing of the script and the conception of some characters.**\r\n\r\nI'm not a fan of superhero movies, but like any movie fan in general, I've seen a good handful of them. This was the first film made by Marvel and financed by the company itself, and it brings us one of its most acclaimed heroes. The film shows how a young playboy millionaire named Tony Stark, with a fortune inherited from his father and largely made from the production and sale of weapons, becomes a vigilante determined not to allow the misuse of the weapons he sells. I don't know much about comics, but I believe that the film was limited to adapting to the cinema a story already written on paper about the origins of the character, giving it, perhaps, a touch of the present.\r\n\r\nThe plot is one of the strongest points of the film, not only for the way it introduces the character in the context of the current geopolitical conflicts (with the Middle East issue very present), but mainly for the way it transforms Tony Stark into a deeper character, who lives a catharsis that opens his conscience to questions that he was not sensitive enough to understand. Put more simply, if initially Stark was a rich and spoiled idiot, he ends the movie with another awareness of what he should do and how his attitudes influence the world around him. However, I also felt that once Stark realizes what he has to do, and it becomes clear who the enemy is to defeat, the script quickly loses quality and becomes much more basic and underdeveloped.\r\n\r\nWith a skillful direction provided by Jon Favreau, the cast gave us a very good performance. Of course, the public's attention is focused on Robert Downey Jr., an actor who started working in the 80s, but only began to emerge at the turn of the millennium, with some productions (*Gothika*, *Good Night and Good Luck*, *Zodiac*) that he entered before accepting Marvel's proposal. He is perfect in character and gives us his life's work as an actor. Beside him, we can still admire Gwynneth Paltrow, in a more discreet but competent role. The villain was secured by Jeff Bridges, but his work is not so well executed and the actor sometimes doesn't seem to know exactly how to behave in the character.\r\n\r\nWhat can we say about the production values ​​and technical quality of a movie with a millionaire budget of 140 million dollars? It is a film determined to be a blockbuster, which fully achieved all its objectives, earning high profits, pleasing the fans and achieving high praise from the general public and the specialized critics. And the money invested is in plain sight, with a declared bet on very high quality CGI, wonderfully well-executed sound and image effects and really good sets and costumes (with great emphasis - obviously - on Iron Man's suit and Stark's mansion). The cinematography is excellent, the filming work was really well done, and the editing was detailed, giving the film a pleasant rhythm that doesn't tire us out. Finally, a note of praise for the excellent and epic soundtrack.",

That created the personality of a multi-billion dollar entertainment behemoth. That introduced the world to the first of many characters that have become household names and cultural icons. Iron Man stormed on the screen with a lead actor that Hollywood had given up on and a small start-up studio without a single movie under its belt backed by Disney, who had little to no live-action comic experience of their own. But director Jon Favreau’s adlibbed approach leveraged the strengths of his cast and created a world that was simultaneously realistic and magical - where a man could build a flying suit of armor, or a Thunder god could fall in love with a quirky mortal. Many forget that Robert Downey Jr’s personal struggles had left him blacklisted by many in Hollywood, making his casting a risky stroke of brilliance. The result of all this was precisely the lightning in a bottle needed to birth the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",

  "content": "Having inherited his father's skill, \"Tony Stark\" is supplying just about every bit of military hardware to the US Government. On a trip to Afghanistan, however, his convoy is ambushed and he is seriously injured. He awakens in a cave, held hostage by insurgents, and with the help of co-captive \"Yinsen\" (Shaun Toub) must use all of his skills to stay alive and to find a way out of his predicament. Cannibalising just about every bit of kit he can find, he concocts a power source to keep him alive and a suit of armour that enables him to fight his way out. Once free, he determines to further hone this flying suit of armour and use it for the common good. His business partner \"Vanko\" (Jeff Bridges) soon realises there are other, more lucrative, uses and a conspiracy is soon afoot. Can \"Stark\" thwart him and save the day? As ever, there is no jeopardy whatsoever - what this is, is a fun action adventure with loads of top notch visual effects and quite a bit of humour in a script well delivered by an on-form Downey well supported by Gwyneth Paltrow and a solid cast. The \"Iron Man\" stories are not the most complex. It's a pretty linear depiction of good and evil - though it does, at the start, demonstrate some of the ironies of the weapons supplies industry. It's overly long, we spend just a bit too much time getting going, but once it does - it is worth a watch on a big screen.",

  "content": "“The Amazing Spider-Man” has no reason to exist. Spider-man is a hero everyone knows. He´s been around for so long everyone is familiar with his origin, comic fan or not. Its basic pop culture. Then you have the Sam Raimi´s movies. Everyone saw them. They made loads of money and they´re always on tv. They are entertaining movies. “Spider-Man” gave us a good origin story in 2002. This movie simply wasn't needed. \r\nNow I gave it the benefit of the doubt. There´s Burton´s Batman and Nolan´s. Maybe this was a different Spider-Man. A more “dark” vision perhaps! Maybe the movie spent a few minutes on the origin and then wisely moved on with its story. Maybe... well maybe it wasn't just another rehash. A shameless attempt to remake, or how they say it these days, reboot the same idea with minimal changes except the cast. I was naive.\r\nThe whole movie is about Spider-Man´s origin. They traded Mary Jane for another love interest and held off on “The Green Goblin” because that would be too much “rubbing it in the face” for the fans, I guess. We get Gwen Stacy and “The Lizard”. The rest is same old, same old. The same uncle Ben plot, the same scenes about making the suit, learning how to control powers, the search for the criminal Spider-man lets get away with horrific results. Same thing. Except everything is done without a spark of energy or creativity. Raimi´s movies were energetic, flowing with excitement. They were “new”. Seeing Spider-Man on the big screen,  webbing all over the city, fighting “The Green Goblin”, it was amazing. We didn't have “The Avengers” back there, or “Iron Man”. This was like a dream come true for comic fans. \r\n“The Amazing Spider-Man” smells of old cheese. \r\nI tried to take the movie for what it was but it was impossible. My mind would not let me. I knew what was going to happen next. I knew all the plots! I´d seen it all before! \r\nBut even ignoring that the movie just does not work. Its slow, turgid with an unlikable Peter Parker and a CGI lizard for a villain. Parker is a whiny, self centered idiot. His relationship with aunt May and uncle Ben is never fully explored and what little there is consists of Parker being a rude jerk for no reason at all. \r\nThe movie has one thing going for it. The cast. Sally Field and Martin Sheen are great with what little material they have. Emma Stone is sexy and sweet which is “her thing” and again she pulls it off brilliantly.  Rhys Ifans is decent as Curt Connors and surprisingly enough I loved Andrew Garfield as Spidey. Yes, seriously! He looks perfect for the part and he did his best with the horrible script. He´s charismatic and brought his own touch to the role instead of copying Toby Maguire. If the movie is even slightly original its because of him. \r\nSome of the action in the last third of the movie is also spectacular. Spider-man´s movements when fighting are really well done as is the web-slinging. The action is well directed and exciting and the movie sets up a sequel rather nicely. \r\nBut its asking a lot to go over the material everyone knows for two hours for a few minutes of cool action. The movie plays it so safe it hurts. Its competent but never brilliant. Tedious but far too long with little spots of action but few and far between. \r\nI hope in the sequel this “Spider-Man” can find its own style and its own place. Given space to grow and evolve, on the strength of the character and Garfield´s acting this could be the weak start to a new amazing super-hero trilogy. \r\nThen again, maybe i´m just naive.",

  "content": "This is the fourth spider man movie although it is not the fourth sequel but rather one of these reboots which seems to be so popular today. I found the movie to be quite enjoyable but at the same time a bit of a let-down.\r\n\r\nIn some ways it is better than the previous trilogy by Sam Raimi (well it is not very hard to make something that is better than the 2nd installment in that trilogy of course). The film is darker, more serious and Spider Man is not so silly and a total mess-up when out of his costume as the character portrayed by Toby Maquire.\r\n\r\nHowever, this movie has its own faults which makes me have to think hard whether it is really that much of an improvement over the previous movie and this is what makes me feel a bit let-down since I had hope that this reboot would be that “real” Spider Man movie that enabled me to forget about the previous ones.\r\n\r\nA lot of not so interesting scenes are really dragged out and the important stuff is rushed. Peter Parker’s transition to Spider Man after his bitten is over and done with quite quickly. In another scene he spends 5 minutes trying to talk some kid out of a car. He even takes off his mask and gives it to him (what the f…) and in the end just zips him out with a net shot. He could have done that right away and spared us the boring time.\r\n\r\nGenerally I think this movie is indeed a better Spider Man movie than the previous ones though and I quite enjoyed the movie evening yesterday, just not as much as I hoped.",

  "content": "Webb's Spider-Man, Spider-Man, does what ever a Spider can.\r\n\r\nThe Amazing Spider-Man is directed by Marc Webb and collectively written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves. It stars Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Denis Leary, Martin Sheen and Sally Field. Music is by James Horner and cinematography by John Schwartzman. \r\n\r\nPeter Parker (Garfield) was orphaned as a boy when his parents were killed in a plane crash, raised by his Uncle Ben (Sheen) and Aunt May (Field), he is a clever lad but something of an outcast at high school. While investigating the disappearance of his parents and sporting a crush on class mate Gwen Stacy (Stone), Peter's life is tipped upside down when he is bitten by a radioactive spider that gives him abnormal powers. \r\n\r\nWhile the Spider-Man franchise doesn't (thankfully) come packaged with the kind of bizarre mania that comes with Batman, the acolytes are a tough bunch to figure out. Sam Raimi's trilogy garnered close towards $2.5 billion worldwide, yet now, with this reboot (actually it's a reimaging) trundled off of the Sony production line, there are plenty of \"fans\" coming forward to say they never rated Raimi's films! Magurie was this, Dunst was that, Raimi missed the beat of the comic version of Spidey and etc and etc. Well I'm sorry, but I just don't remember any fall out apart from the near unanimously agreed upon over stuffing of Raimi's part 3. Perhaps I just didn't go on the right Spider-Man forums? But even then it's hard to argue with a box office take of $2.5 billion, those figures have to be made up of a good proportion of Spidey fans, surely? You would reasonably think. \r\n\r\nI mention it because The Amazing Spider-Man has met with reviews from each end of the scale. Those at the high end who support the \"reimaging\" seem to focus on it being close to the real Spidey universe they wanted, with great casting, better effects work and a origin story of worth. At the other end is the arguments that \"reimaging\" a film that is only ten years old is daft, especially since it actually doesn't bring the promised new direction or origin story of worth. In fact it just juggles bits of the Raimi trilogy and plays it out with other Spider-Man characters instead. While Garfield is hardly an improvement since he's way too old for high school as well! The truth is that Webb's movie falls somewhere in between both sides of the argument, and that's not just me being Switzerland and staying neutral! \r\n\r\nNegatively it plays out as a compromised production and not the film that the makers initially set out to make, there are too many dangling threads and haphazard edits that leave narrative gaps. An Important character disappears off the radar, other characters are given limited time to breathe, and crucial plot points are arrived at with stupendous leaps of logic. A coda spliced into the end credits tries to entice us for the sequel, suggesting that the quick wipe over the origin \"origin\" story was deliberate, it's unlikely, and feels like an afterthought. For a film that purports to be putting its own stamp on the Spidey universe, it quite often makes you think of Raimi's films anyway. It may be The Lizard instead of Green Goblin and Gwen instead of MJ, but the emotional and psychological beats are still the same. Reboot? My arse. Oh and Horner, who I'm normally a fan of, has turned in a score that lacks vim and vigour, it aspires to be full of swirling superhero fervour to raise the goose flesh on your arms, but instead it's just goose, and not a decently cooked one at that. \r\n\r\nHowever, on the positive side of things, low expectation really helped me to enjoy the film, and I even watched it a second time to check over some initial reactions I had. There is still a lot to enjoy here. Acting is of a high standard (Ifans' performance as Curt Connors gets better on repeat viewings), with good chemistry generated between Stone and Garfield, the effects work is (obviously) better ten years on; something which gives us a better-more acrobatic-moving Spider-Man, while the whole make-up of Parker as a geek who becomes cocky, even arrogant, really adds a kick to the first half of the movie's coming-of-age narrative bent. It's also good that with a running time of over two hours the makers have the time to expand Peter as a character, making the audience wait with expectation of his life changing date with the spider. As for the villain, it's true enough to say that The Lizard is hardly an inspiring choice, but it does fit in with the whole origin story plan that Webb and his team want to tell. Though it should be noted that those seeking wall to wall fights between Spidey and The Liz are going to go a little hungry. \r\n\r\nIt's big on human story and not the lazy cash in movie it could have been, and undeniably it's fun, but the holes, dangling threads and logic leaps stop it breaking out to achieve its intentions. Looking forward to the sequel, mind 7/10",

  "content": "I enjoyed this. One of the great advantages of the whole \"Spiderman\" concept is that it can be reinvented time and time again without really compromising the original character - a decent but lonely young man trying to make his way in the world and to get his girl. Like Tobey Maguire before him, the casting of the largely unknown Andrew Garfield works well - it allows a whole new generation of fans to follow their hero. The fact that he is cute in tights doesn't do him any harm either. Emma Stone is quite good, too, as the object of his affections \"Mary Jane\" and the whole look of the film is sophisticated and colourful. The story is very derivative, however - and that is the problem with this film. Though there is plenty of action, it becomes a little repetitive and uninspired. The CGI will always look good, and will increasingly do most of the work with these kind of films - indeed, just about everything in the Marvel Universe is 90% style over substance; but so long as they can still recruit enthusiastic actors to play the roles than the franchise might still have legs (though hopefully not eight) for the future. Martin Sheen and Sally Field add a little gravitas to the proceedings - the former has one of these wonderful Churchillian style voices that just goes on resonating, and Rhys Ifans makes for an OK mad scientist. As a stand alone adventure this works fine. Maybe a bit too long, but a cinema experience to be relished - then, maybe, just put away again for seven years.",

  "content": "Despite myself, I actually quite enjoyed this. After (what looked like) a platonic one night stand, \"Bea\" (Sydney Sweeney) and \"Ben\" (Glen Powell) manage to part company loathing one another. Serendipity has no intention of allowing this to be the end of things though, and so arranges for her sister to marry one of his best friends. After a few uncomfortable meetings in a bar, they all head off to Australia for the nuptials. Her parents are very keen to get her back with ex \"Jonathan\" (Darren Barnet) whilst his ex \"Margaret\" (Charlee Fraser) is also there. Against their better judgment our two decide to pretend to be a couple to provoke envy from one and protect the other from the intent of the meddling parents. What now ensues does really depend on a plausible degree of chemistry between Sweeney and Powell and I thought they did quite well. A little bit more meddling from Bryan Brown, some Di Caprio-esque action at the front of a yacht and some kindly support from the Sydney harbour rescue helicopter helps keep this amiably jogging along for an admittedly twenty minutes too long 1¾ hours. It's quite pithily written and manages to avoid the worst in both American and Australian stereotypes. It also isn't shy of sex, comic nudity and a bit of practical adult humour that makes a change from the usual puerile smut we are so frequently offered nowadays. It's entirely forgettable, but is an enjoyable enough dollop of sun, sea, sex and silliness.",

The nations of the world send forces into the future to help fight the war but with a very high casualty rate; a worldwide draft is soon instituted to replenish the numbers.\r\n\r\nDan is eventually drafted and told he has 24 hours to get things in order before he is deployed for seven days at which time he will be returned. Dan contemplates running and seeks out his estranged father (J.K. Simmons); who has a deep disdain for governments and conducts himself in a shady fashion to the point where Dan will not let him anywhere near his daughter.\r\n\r\nDan eventually deploys and finds a nightmare version of the future where cities are in ruin and the deadly and very tough enemy is everywhere.\r\n\r\nAs the tension mounts; Dan must team up with the leader of the resistance to develop a way to fight the aliens and save humanity before it is too late.\r\n\r\nThe film features some good FX and action and while there were many times I questioned why a different course of action was not attempted; the film eventually attempts to address many questions later in the film.\r\n\r\nWhile the final act may seem overblown and too convenient; the film works as an enjoyable and action-filled escape as long as you are willing to just go along with the ride and not ask too many questions along the way.\r\n\r\nWhile there are elements of prior Science Fiction and Horror films evident; the cast and premise work well and the movie is a step above most offerings that are sold to streaming services and is well worth a watch.\r\n3.5 stars out of 5",

Chris McKay demonstrates all of his undeniable talent behind the camera, delivering brilliantly directed action scenes featuring excellent camera work, a chill-inducing score, and exceptional VFX - the Whitespikes look stunningly scary. Zach Dean doesn't avoid the formulas and cliches of the genre, offering a generic story with no real surprises but still possessing remarkable character work. Chris Pratt is great as the protagonist, but Yvonne Strahovski is on a whole other level, delivering one of her best performances ever in a feature film. With an overextended runtime, the last act is mostly unnecessary and less exciting, ultimately making the ending a tad underwhelming compared to the epic conclusion of the second act. I wouldn't be surprised if it gains a cult following, though. Tremendous replay value. Highly recommend it.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B",

The film's premise lends to some confusion with trying to change timelines, leading to moments of disjointed logic and confusing plot points. But let me be honest, if you don't take the science seriously, you will enjoy the movie. The aliens are super creepy and overwhelming. Transporting soldiers to the future to help try to overcome a failing war for survival provides a fresh take on the alien battle trope. I enjoyed the parts of the movie that took place in the future where the risk and danger were higher than the present-day parts that were more focused on exposition. Because The Tomorrow War was released straight to streaming, I had low expectations that were undeniably exceeded. I will be back to watch this one again.",

  "content": "Gladiator has been my most favorite film of all time. It is an epic masterpiece in many ways and it really explains why despite the numerous viewings, Gladiator still amuses me with its powerful imageries and many other crucial aspects so that it won five Academy Awards. This film is very well written, the well-ensemble casts, the A-class acting (especially Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix), the stunning cinematography and definitely a strong character of Maximus (magnificently portrayed by Russell Crowe) whose life, struggle, disappointment and anger really move the audience, as if the world attention centers on him. Gladiator is not a historical film, because it only used the history of the ancient Roman Empire merely as the time setting.\r\nAll other aspects namely those gorgeous shots, the great storyline/plot, the fantastic cinematography, the vividly lavish colors, detailed production design and digital imaging (that successfully rebuilt the stunning beauty of the ancient Roman Empire) and all sell really well, making the 170 minute-long running time definitely worthwhile. The visual of great battle in the first 15 minutes really stole my heart. The gruesome pictures, the blood and violence just to beautiful to abandon. Everything in this movie seems perfectly balanced, Ridley Scott as the film director really did his homework well in redefining and revitalizing the big battle sequence once considered masterpiece from Spartacus and Ben Hur. In the end, once again, I would say that Gladiator perfectly combines some crucial elements such as good, moving story, dazzling visual, beautiful scenery, filming techniques, direction and touching music score into one harmonious, action-packed film about heroism and its true meaning.",

  "content": "They said you were a giant. They said you can crush a man's skull with one hand.\r\n\r\nRidley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.\r\n\r\nIn narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.\r\n\r\nWhat we do in life echoes in eternity.\r\n\r\nSo no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel, actually overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny - with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.\r\n\r\nBacking Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.\r\n\r\nI didn't know man could build such things.\r\n\r\nDialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",

Russell Crowe is the eponymous soldier \"Maximus\". Commander of the Armies of the Rhine for Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) and his designated successor - until, that is, the emperor's son \"Commodus\" (Joaquin Phoenix) and his sister \"Lucilla\" (an efficient Connie Nielsen) arrive and suddenly it's all change at the top. Betrayed and left for dead, our hero must now make other shifts if he is to survive in his new world - controlled by slave-owning \"Proximo\" (Oliver Reed) and deliver him of vengeance on his new Imperial nemesis. The film looks great, the cast - including some some strong supporting efforts from Sir Derek Jacobi, John Shrapnel, Djimon Hounsou and Tomas Arana all contribute well to this grandeur of this historical saga. The high politics, betrayal and duplicity are matched with a sense of integrity and camaraderie as \"Maximus\" begins to galvanise his colleagues and his political allies into something more than a disparate band fighting just to survive each day. Reed and Harris both feature only sparingly, but both add a richness to the characterisations that are dominated by two on-form performances from Crowe and Phoenix that epitomise a struggle of good versus evil and ultimate power in an empire where corruption and brutality trade human life as if it were a watermelon. Add to this some superb visual effects and a rousing score from Hans Zimmer (and Lisa Gerrard) and we have a compelling watch on a big screen that shows there is still a glimmer of the Cecil B. De Mille spirit left in Hollywood.",

It stars Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo & Kevin J. O'Connor. Jerry Goldsmith scores the music and cinematography is by Adrian Biddle. Plot sees Fraser as ex-Foreign Legionnaire adventurer Rick O'Connell, who teams up with Egyptologist Evelyn Carnahan (Weisz) and her cowardly brother Jonathan (Hannah), to try and stave off the apocalypse born out of the unleashing of the mummified remains of High Priest Imhotep (Vosloo).\r\n\r\nIt's true to say that \"Indiana Jones\" raised the bar for action/adventure films in the modern era, the kind involving treasure, artifacts and mystical perils. It's arguably true enough to say that with \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" the standard has been set so high it's unlikely to be bettered. There's been a number of similar films to have come along post \"Indiana Jones\", films that have one thing in common, that the critics are scornful towards them whilst the box office has kerchinged with the sound of cash being spent by the cinema going public. \"The Mummy\" is one such movie. Universal rework their own 1930's creeper to deliver a high energy, effects laden adventure full of wit, stunts and eye candy fun. Yes it's \"Indiana Jones\" lite, but so what? We may be lacking an intellectual script, but for sheer guts, construction of set-pieces and interesting story, this delivers wholesome family entertainment. Cast are fine, Fraser comfortably files in for square jawed heroics and Weisz is suitably posh, spunky and sexy. Hannah revels in playing a wastrel type, while Arnold Vosloo is enjoying himself greatly. However it's  ultimately the effects that win out, explosive and eye poppingly enjoyable, Sommers and his team have not pulled any punches in their willingness to entertain all the adventure film loving family. 7.5/10",

Also, be ready for quite a few laugh-out-loud parts.\r\n\r\nEverything magically works, granting the viewer a highly entertaining romp. Brendan Fraser is perfect as the Indiana Jones wannabe.

Arnold Vosloo is great as the mummy Imhotep and Oded Fehr is memorable as Ardeth Bay, the Magi guardian of the City of the Dead.

On that level, it's filmmaking of the highest order.\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 2 hours, 4 minutes, and was shot in England, Morocco and Glen Canyon, Arizona.  \r\n\r\nGRADE: A-",

This remake takes the original monster movie and brilliantly blends it with \"Indiana Jones\"esque adventure. Though primarily an action-adventure movie, The Mummy adds comedy and horror with outstanding results. Brendan Fraser and John Hannah's humor provides moments of release between monster kills and the attack of undead hordes. Stephen Sommers perfectly balances fun and fright, simultaneously leaving the audience in peril and safety. The Mummy has something for everyone creating a delightful and widely entertaining action-horror romp. This film lands at the number one spot as my favorite creature feature of all time!",

Stephen Sommers keeps this moving along well, and there is enough in the script to make you smile now and again. Perhaps not a film to be too closely scrutinised by any Egyptologists out there, but it's an enjoyable little romp through a rarely exploited vein of ancient mythology.",

He's not just a great action hero but also someone you can't help but root for. His chemistry with Rachel Weisz, who plays the smart and fearless Evelyn, makes the story even more engaging. Add in the brilliant Arnold Vosloo as the menacing Imhotep, and you've got a cast that makes every scene memorable.\r\n\r\nThe film's mix of practical effects and CGI, while dated in some places, still works beautifully to create an epic, larger-than-life feel.

She and her friends go there to renovate it into a haunted house attraction. Unfortunately, when the fog rolls in, so does Popeye.\r\n\r\n“Popeye’s Revenge” (2025) was the first of three low-budget horror flicks to take advantage of the character entering the public domain; the other two would debut 5-7 weeks later, namely “Popeye the Slayer Man” and “Shiver Me Timbers.” This one was produced by the same company that released the Poohverse movies in the last couple of years, such as “Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey” and its sequel.\r\n\r\nWhile it has a different director and writers, it’s cut from the same cloth and is pretty much cookie cutter. For instance, it opens with the same sketch illustrations to tell the backstory and, later, there’s a hot tub sequence with the most alluring female in the cast buying the farm.\r\n\r\nStill, it is entertaining to have Popeye as the antagonist and there’s no eye-rolling wokeness to be found. In addition, the filmmaking is proficient for low-budget fare and the no-name cast rises to the challenge. Meanwhile, the scenic mountain landscapes are a plus. As for the feminine cast, redhead Atlanta Moreno stands out as Sky, but there’s also Eva Ray as Cherry and Danielle Ronald as Donna, amongst one or two others, like blonde Karolina Ugrenyuk as Kathy, who smacks of haughtiness.\r\n\r\nRegrettably, I didn’t find the story as compelling as other low-budget cabin-in-the-woods flicks, such as \"Lurking Woods,\" \"The Lake on Clinton Road\" and \"Crazy Lake\" (all from a decade ago). Nevertheless, if you’re in the mood for cabin-in-the-woods horror, this fills the bill in a run-of-the-mill way. I can’t compare it with the two contemporaneous Popeye flicks, however, since I have yet to see them.\r\n\r\nIt runs 1 hour, 19 minutes, and was shot in England and Scotland (more specific locations are elusive).\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+",

Never has a film from the cinematic universe been so violent, bloody, and terrifying.\r\n\r\nBenedict Cumberbatch and especially Elizabeth Olsen carry the complex story about the multiverse through Michael Waldron's flawed screenplay. The balance between the various storylines could be better, America Chavez is just one MacGuffin to reach another MacGuffin, and the journey through the multiple universes only compensates for the mind-blowing visual effects.\r\n\r\nSome personal disappointment is associated with the cameos treatment and the lack of real-location filming. Overall, more was expected from what was supposed to be Phase Four's \"big movie\", but it's a solid entry into the top half of the franchise.\"\r\n\r\nRating: B",

The story is really pretty thin with the engaging and confident Benedict Cumberbatch joining forces with the charismatic and feisty young Xochitl Gomez' \"America\" - a young lady who has been appearing in his dreams. Turns out, she can cross from one universe to another - and soon both are being sought by the mighty Elizabeth Olsen's \"Wanda Maximoff\" (surely a \"Bond\" girl?) who wants control of time so she can get back to her lost family, yada yada... Benedict Wong features sparingly, but always adds a little value as the \"Sorcerer Supreme\" and there are a few cameos from Charlize Theron and Sir Patrick Stewart to help prop up what is, admittedly, a pretty meagre second half. I think this multiverse strand could provide Marvel with the gift that keeps on giving, but they have got to tighten the pace up - two hours for this was just too long; the plot doesn't sustain it and though the combat scenes are nothing to the length in the \"Avengers\" movies; there is still far too much slack here. It does look and sound great on a big screen, though, and I am now warming to the star in the role (and his intuitive flying cape). Fun, but flawed.",

Not so much of the Marvel wit and humor that are more like to hold me, the anything but average fan, or rather,not a fan at all, though I do like science fiction.\r\n\r\nFor me, the 500 pound elephant in the room that cast a shadow over the entire movie was the villain. Now if you haven’t seen the film yet this may count as a spoiler, though it is revealed fairly early on. But the former heroine turned evil one is a woman taken over by the dark side. But what got me was her motive. Not to take over the world or the universe or the multiverse, but rather because she wanted to be a mommy to kids she lost along the way, or never had, or something. Billions of people in multiple universes died because she didn’t want to adopt. \r\n\r\nIt seems like inserting herself into one universe might have been enough for you or me, but I suppose she wanted more options open if something went wrong with the first kids whose mother she killed (or is it her alternate self?) to get hold of. Dr. Strange even asked about it once, and she blithely explained that if her new old kids got terribly sick, she could find the cure for anything in other universes. She is the perfect mom, doing anything for her kids; well, except for providing moral leadership and showing them the path to be a good person who helps others and contributes to the world around them. Yeah, do as I say, kids, not as I do. \r\n\r\nWhoever created the evil dark book that took over her personality would have been disappointed that it was used merely to seed a new family.",

Even those initial stumbling blocks I could have gotten past, but Disney decided to interject their woke garbage into this movie like many other new shows which has now put them on a blacklist for so many others like me. Not sure I would ever pay or even 'watch for free' anything by this company again, but that is me. I have standards, and clearly Disney is determined to brainwash their viewers with woke trash.

  "content": "Words cannot express how incredibly overwrought, insipid, hyperactive and foolishly exaggerated the third entry into the action-packed _XXX_ film franchise is in the nonsensical and numbing operative spectacle **XXX: Return of Xander Cage**. Monosyllabic muscle-bound action star Vin Diesel revisits the rollicking and roguish skin of athletic spy/sports enthusiast Xander Cage in yet another splashy yet sophomoric throbbing thrill-ride that only diehard Diesel fanboys will swallow with unapologetic fervor.\r\n\r\nWhen in doubt Diesel knows where his bread is buttered in terms of his secured box office appeal. The pumped-up performer has initiated the hoopla with a couple of popular action flicks in the past only to leave them briefly before deciding to return front and center. Diesel has done this tactic with the inexplicably desired _The Fast and the Furious_ movie series as well as the aforementioned _XXX_ offerings (actor/singers Tyrese Gibson and Ice Cube inherited the big screen honors in replacing the absent Diesel in these energized ditties respectively). Now Diesel is called into service once again to capitalize on the extreme spy genre while satisfying those thrill-seekers whose thirst for the James Bond and Jason Bourne action-grabbers may be perceived as relentlessly mild as the acrobatic antics of the hip Bald Bold One looks to overshadow his competitors in daunting dumbness.\r\n\r\nBottom line: who the heck was cramming for the ridiculous return of the attention-getting Xander Cage other than the motivated machismo of star/co-producer Diesel strutting his all-too-familiar slick shtick in an empty-minded vanity project that is jumpier than a kangaroo with the hiccups? There is nothing like playing to the convoluted escapism and exploiting the loyal demographics that continue to get a charge out of Diesel’s boisterous brand from the _Fast and Furious_ enterprise that still sizzles for some and fizzles for others. Nevertheless, this espionage eyesore features Diesel’s Cage at his best…and that is not saying much. He is as smooth as ice soothing your ailing tonsils. Check. He is a chick magnet to the highest degree. Check again. He can turn his biceps and brawn into an invaluable weapon for the safety of his country and comrades. Double check and then some. Overall, we get it…Xander Cage is a badass without boundaries and daredevil Diesel and his on-screen cohorts wants to reinforce such titillating tripe. Go figure.\r\n\r\nGranted that **XXX: Return of Xander Cage’s** sole purpose is to play into the pulsating popcorn pleasure of its audience while expecting one not to take the excitable escapades too seriously. Still, the tired formula for this particular genre in general (not to mention a Vin Diesel-starring vehicle) feels utterly uninspired and recycled despite the ambitious showcasing of active triggers that include high-wire skiing through the woods, dirt bike surfing, daring skateboarding prowess while clinging to the side of a moving bus and oh yeah…a lot of colorful butt-kicking tactics to boot. The highly stylized lifestyle of the free-wheeling Cage is by-the-numbers hedonism–cause havoc, conquer the lovely ladies hormonal for his suave affections and come off looking cool this side of 70’s knockoff bad motherf&%$# private eye John Shaft in taking care of business. Great spy work if you can conjure it up for indiscriminate action junkies wanting to engage in this souped-up silliness without rhyme or reason.\r\n\r\nFor those not quite familiar with the Xander Cage “mythology” he was an extreme sports talent that had been recruited by NSA head honcho Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) to utilize his competitive skills and abilities undercover. Now Cage is back in the saddle as he horses around on yet another challenging assignment that finds him butting heads with a trio of baddies in Deepika Padukone’s Serena, Donnie Yen’s Xiang and Tony Jaa’s Talon–a threatening threesome experimenting with dangerously rigging outer space satellites or something to that trivial effect. Of course the crafty Cage–beyond wily and reckless–is often reigned in by the likes of his superiors including Agent Jane Marke (Oscar and Emmy nominated Australian actress Toni Collette needlessly toiling away in this toothless contraption of a spy thriller).\r\n\r\nDirector D.J. Caruso (2016’s “The Disappointments Room”) merely goes through the motions with this disjointed spy caper that flexes its moronic muscles without offering much else to the preposterous proceedings. The displayed dialogue in a Lucky Charms cereal commercial has more credibility than the words leaving the lips of the featured players in this woefully generic actioner. Diesel, who has shown some promise as an actor in previous critical fare from yesteryear such as 2000’s _Boiler Room_ and 2006’s _Find Me Guilty_ has since played it safe and relied on the frivolous “sure thing” with the repetitive Furious installments and other fluffy movie projects that had diminished his potential in Hollywood beyond the brainless blow-em-up cinema that he finds automatic comfort in churning out as a cinematic safety net.\r\n\r\nAlthough they say that a single “X” usually marks the spot it takes triple X’s to disprove this theory when welcoming back the chaotic coolness that is Diesel’s detached dude in cocky-minded Xander Cage–the sensationalized showboat that should have left his debuted one-dimensional adventurous tendencies back in 2002.\r\n\r\n**XXX: Return of Xander Cage** (2017)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** (2017)",

  "content": "I must confess that I did have higher hopes for this movie. I’m not sure what the script writers was up to when writing it but they really seem to have a very low opinion of the audience’s intelligence. Either that or it was written for a very young audience.\r\n\r\nThere were parts of the movie that was quite fun to watch but on the whole it was pretty much a mess. It is a shame because it had quite a bit of promise. The core of the plot was not too bad although I really wish that Hollywood writers would stay away from plots involving computer gadgetry. Their knowledge in that area simply stinks. Thus the gadget that the entire movie was spun around was simply stupid.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately another core plot element was the crooked CIA (or whatever department it was supposed to be) boss that of course had to do some senseless backstabbing just to prolong the movie. Tiresome, overused and boring. I know, I know with fucktards like Comey I guess one could say that it would not be too far from the truth but it is still tiresome, overused and boring.\r\n\r\nSince I am on a rant anyway let’s go on to the various stunts and special effects. It is a long time since I watched a movie where the stunts were so obviously and totally overdone and unrealistic. I mean, they were unrealistic to the point where I started to wander if it was a slapstick comedy I was watching.\r\n\r\nAll of this really dragged down the movie … a lot!\r\n\r\nOn the good side. I did like many of the wacky characters. It is a shame that many of their wacky moments were less of a comic relief due to the above mentioned silliness but instead felt like the more serious moments in the movie.\r\n\r\nVin Diesel, well I watched this movie because I am a Vin Diesel fan so of course I liked him. He is his usual badass and kick ass self. He is also surrounded by a bunch of badass (and wacky as I mentioned before) characters. I quite liked the ensemble. The guy who seems to collect crashes is rather silly but fun in a strange way. I did like the gun girl a lot.\r\n\r\nHowever, apart from quite a few fun and/or cool scenes the movie as a whole did not cut it. In my opinion it was ruined by a substandard script devoid of any form of intelligence. I would go as far as to say that the writers were incompetent pure and simple. I was almost giving it three stars because there was many parts I liked but in the end … no, there is no way I could justify more than two stars for this mess.\r\n\r\nReally a shame. I would have liked to see more xXx movies but after this one I’m not sure anyone will bet money on that.",

  "content": "**A new franchise is on making!**\r\n\r\nI was very happy when I heard about a sequel is on the development of Vin Diesel's one of the career early films. I was a teenager, and I remember celebrating it in the theatre with my friends. But, like the T2, it was too late for a sequel. Most of other franchises are going for spin-offs in the similar case. Anyway, it was good to see the original character back in the action. Although not liked changing the title logo. The original is evergreen.\r\n\r\nWell, the story continued as the same gap between the first and this film. I thought the original concept was like solo action hero kind, but in here, it became a multi-starrer. Like most of the similar themed action film series, it tried to add variety of characters, including clichés like computer hackers and a boss to handle those rogue guys. But there were too many Triple Xes.\r\n\r\nThe story was okay. It only wanted to make a comeback, like a re- introduction of everything. I liked the diversity in the film characters. The casting was from around the world, picking the best team like Donnie Yen from HK, Tony Jaa from Thailand. But I did not understand why Donnie was speaking in Mandarin, instead of Cantonese.\r\n\r\nFrom all I did not like Deepika. Yes, she's the real Indian beauty, but not a good actor, especially for actions, she's unsuitable. I would have preferred Priyanka in here. They two should have switched the films between this and 'Baywatch'. Jaa, I did think he had in him his witty character display. He was a completely different person in this. The rest of the guys were too not bad at all, particularly that stunt guy was awesome.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the action sequences, not some, many were totally impossible. Surely not the really performed stunts they were. Simply a special effects, and it was too much to take on. Because they were not realistically appealing to accept. Those include, non-snow mountain skiing, ocean wave bike surfing, you add it. The good news is, it was okay for watching once, but I'm anticipating the next part to be a game changer in the franchise.\r\n\r\n_5/10_",

YES, the performances are as good as the Academy says. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is one of my favorite films and I have watched it many, many times. Javier Bardem, makes an excellent screen villain, this guy is really scary, you would not want him chasing you. Josh Brolin, and Tommy Lee Jones turn in Solid Performances, and Woody Harrelson also. I'm saving my praise for KELLY MACDONALD, one of my favorite actors. KELLY nails that southern accent. which is always surprising because her speaking voice is so Scottish, she does not have a lot of screen time but when she is on screen, you will know, you are watching a great performance. I absolutely give NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN <> Ten Stars 10**********",

  "content": "I always figured when I got older, God would sorta come inta my life somehow. And he didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I would have the same opinion of me that he does. \r\n\r\nNo Country for Old Men is directed by Joel Coen and Ethan Coen, and the Coen's adapt the screenplay from Cormac McCarthy's novel of the same name. It stars Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Woody Harelson, Javier Bardem and Kelly Macdonald. Music is by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Roger Deakins.  \r\n\r\nWhen a hunter stumbles upon the bloody aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong, he decides to make off with cash left at the scene, that violence and life threat will follow from here on in...\r\n\r\nNot quite the genius masterpiece some would have you believe, this is however and decidedly dark, sombre, gothic type thriller with noir shadings. The ultimate message slowly pulsing away is one of how making a fateful decision can shape the course of many people's lives, with fate ready at various junctures to trip you up. \r\n\r\nThe Coen's and McCarthy are not in it to offer hope for a better world, this really is a life stinks and is evil narrative, none more so than portrayed by Bardem's chilling psycopath. The unpredictable nature of the story keeps things on the high heat, even as Deakins brings beauty via his colour photography, his teaming with the Coen's brings visual smarts.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is tightly formed, giving the actors something great to work with, and as they respond in kind, while we the audience are drawn in close to the slow burning madness. It definitely finds the brothers Coen returning to their best, as they take McCarthy's melancholic machismo and drip their self aware irony over proceedings. \r\n\r\nThe finale lacks a punch, and in fact it's a little boorish, while this narrative has been done well before in film noirs of the original wave - so it's not as fresh and exciting to us more mature film lovers. Yet it's still a great piece of film making, the like we could do with more regularly. 9/10 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n, gorgeously photographed by longtime Coen associate Roger Deakins, and genuinely smart, but its insights boil down to \"Whichever way you turn, fate sticks out a foot to trip you,\" and DETOUR (1945) got there first.",

The plot is taut and somewhat riveting, with great dialogue and acting.  At the same time, for me, it seemed rather bleak. I gradually had the sense it would not end well for nearly anybody. If it weren’t for the Tommy Lee Jones character, I am not sure I would have wanted to stick with it. He provides a sort of balance in the mood of the film. I am not a big fan of movies with super criminals. You know the ones — they seem to always be one step ahead of the hero or the authorities, free to run roughshod until that are defeated at the very end of the movie, if at all. Woody Harrelson delivers another one of his stellar performances. Who knew he would be so good very early on in his career?\r\n\r\nOddly enough, No Country for Old Men caused metaphorical violence to our movie watch group, as there was an exchange that caused us to watch no more films together.

I clearly don't get it, which I'm fine with.\r\n\r\nI'm all for films that don't play it so straight that it's predictable, but at the same time I'm rarely a fan of films that are so full of themselves to end in such a derisory way. Listen, that's probably harsh as it is still a good flick no doubt, but <em>'No Country for Old Men'</em> is highly unsatisfactory and highly uninspiring for me.\r\n\r\nI will say that I have no issues with the cast whatsoever, they are all fantastic. Javier Bardem is awesome, easily the star, and Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin and Woody Harrelson are all top value. Kelly Macdonald and Garret Dillahunt are also involved, I like them too. Stephen Root, Mr. 'L for Love' himself, as well. Away from the onscreen bunch, the cinematography is superb.\r\n\r\nIt's the story. I didn't get what I wanted from it, at all. All the ingredients are there for a 10/10 film, that's the level I was expecting it to reach based on the opening half or so. The second half though... super disappointing! So many underwhelming choices. Such a waste of a strong cast... <em>'The Counselor'</em>-esque. Bardem is also in that, sorry my dude!\r\n\r\nThe fact I'm still giving this what I consider to be a positive rating shows how much the conclusion frustrated me. This had top tier written all over it but it somehow messed it up as it went by... and I'm not usually one to dig out a film's ending.\r\n\r\nIn my defence, even some reviews (many, in fact) from people who love the film mention that the ending isn't perfect so I guess it just comes down to how the final moments sit with you. For me, evidently not good!",

Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh stands out immediately as a new iconic film villain full of foreboding relentless focus and cold uncaring presence. No Country is clearly a product of the Coen Brothers' unique charm and style. It boasts some tense shoot-outs, and the uncompromising pursuit of Josh Brolin's character was fantastic. Unfortunately, it drags along in some places but by design. The ending is probably supposed to be symbolic and clever, but it was sudden and lost on me (a guy that takes pretty much everything at face value). All in all, it's a good movie, but I am at a loss for why it won an Oscar for Best Picture (although I don't think it had much competition from Transformers or Shrek the Third).",

He is \"Anton\", a ruthlessly efficient killer on the hunt for a missing bag of loot that has fallen into the hands of the opportunistic \"Moss\" (Josh Brolin) after a drug deal goes awry. The latter man soon cottons onto the fact that his life is now considerably more at risk and he has to figure just out how to survive long enough to escape and enjoy his cash. \"Moss\" might just have an unlikely and unwitting ally, though, in the form of the pursuing but rather unenthusiastic sheriff \"Bell\" (Tommy Lee Jones) but, well you just wouldn't want to bet against the truly menacing Bardem! It's violent and brutal, sure - but it's also darkly humorous with plenty of pithy banter and quite some degree of characterisation from both Brolin and Bardem as the denouement looms large. That conclusion is as unpredictable as the rest of this quirkily scary and entertaining crime drama that uses an oxygen cylinder with startlingly effective results in this game of lethal Russian Roulette. Nobody is safe, nobody is innocent - and it doesn't matter whose side you are, ostensibly, on either. It's perfectly paced by the Coen brothers, the characters and the story given ample opportunity to develop and to breathe and by the conclusion I was definitely rooting for someone! It has shades of the old wild-west Texan Western genre to it, it reeks of authenticity and is really well worth a watch.",

I doubt this will fare well in the future, and if anything, it will cause a renewed interest in Nightfall, with Aldo Ray and Brian Keith.\r\nLike Nightfall, we have an investigator who feels he is in over his head in a case of money stolen from hoodlums. \r\nLike Nightfall, the hero stumbles across stolen money and is also in over his head.\r\nLike Nightfall, there is a sadist who makes a game out of killing his victims.\r\nLike Nightfall, the sadist has an ally who is repulsed by the sadist, and is killed by the sadist. \r\nThe only difference is that \"No Country\" presents the hoodlums as the \"gods\" that dorks worship so much. \r\nAlso, in total plagiarism of Nightfall, the sadistic killer entices his victims to believe there is a contest, when in reality, the killer is going to decide the fate no matter what. In \"No Country\", it's the toss of a coin, but anyuone who knows sadists knows that it's a rigged contest. \r\n\"No Country For Old Men\" presents the sadist in the usual Hollywood formula of being immortal and godlike. In \"Nightfall\", the sadist is a mortal. \"No Country\" endeavors to contrive every bit of the story to show that if you're sadistic enough, you are immortal, the true Hollywood formula since about 1965. (Godfather and other gangster movies, Leone westerns, almost all horror movies e.g.).\r\nSo, we have a total lack of risk taking in McCarthy writing the total \"safe\" Hollywood story, to join the innumerable other such Hollywood stories that fail to either inspire or instruct, meant only to make the Beavis and Butthead viewers guffaw with delight.",

So the big question was, will TDKR actually be more like the first or the second film? The answer is: neither.\r\n\r\nThis third instalment of the Nolan-franchise carries its weight all on its own merits. Despite the lack of any kind of intro or opening credits, there actually is plenty of build-up (partly thanks to the insane opening scene). The foundation for a proper, action-packed story is laid down perfectly, explaining things just enough whilst keeping the viewer intrigued to find out more. But if you thought that Nolan couldn't surpass his previous work, you will be pleasantly deceived.\r\n\r\nChristian Bale as Batman is terrific. Never before was a superhero so human, so vulnerable. As his mask of intangibility and anonymity slowly starts to crumble, this is a man who questions his reasons to keep being who he is, and he must figure it out before it is too late. Because somebody’s preparing to take him and Gotham down, and he might just be too strong for the Batman...\r\n\r\nThis somebody is a character called Bane. As a character, an actor and a performance it must be incredibly hard to follow Heath Ledger's The Joker, which was easily one of the greatest villains to ever appear on the silver screen. But tonight, Tom Hardy took a swing for the fence... and made it. His performance is thrilling and actually frightening, in the sense that you don't just *know* you're supposed to be afraid of this character, you actually FEEL it. He instils a feeling of horror and discomfort that is not rivalled by many other film villains. What I actually liked about his character the most is the fact that unlike Scarecrow, who grew into being a villain, and the Joker, who was just a raving maniac, Bane was actually (literally) born from evil. Born in hell, as it is said in the film. This is not a man, this is a creature. A living, breathing manifestation of evil that cannot be reasoned or negotiated with. Hardy's performance is masterful. Since his creepy mask is never removed, he, like only a few actors before him, must act without the use of any facial expressions, making his voice is main tool. His manner of speech (and the sound of it through his mask) is enough to send chills down your spine. This is more than just a another villain from a superhero flick, this is a character that just got torpedoed into the top 10 of the greatest antagonists in the history of film. Now I realise that's a bold statement to make, but you just go and watch TDKR and prove me wrong.\r\n\r\nI would say a slight downside to this film is the overflow of characters, both new and old. Aside from the already familiar characters, three new major ones are introduced. And there are also many characters running along in the margin which may seem not important enough to pay attention to, but actually they are so you need to stay focused.\r\n\r\nI understand the character of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Blake, was written in specifically for him because Nolan wanted him in it. And although as a character he works just fine, it does feel like it was at the expense of Gary Oldman. As a cop, Levitt does everything that Oldman's character could've done, but he spends most of his screen time in the hospital, almost like they wanted to get him out of the way, and that's really too bad.\r\n\r\nNow, I was extremely excited to see what Nolan had done with Catwoman, because she is one of my favourite film characters. When I heard that she would be played by Anne Hathaway, I had my doubts. I thought she was just way too sweet to pull this off. But I must say, Ms Hathaway did a pretty good job. She is actually much more sly and devious than I thought she could be. The Nolan brothers, on the other hand, disappointed me here. Catwoman isn't really Catwoman, she's just a sexy girl in a spandex suit who can kick your ass. Her movements aren't even typically cat-like... So that was a bit of a letdown.\r\n\r\nI would also like to make a note on Michael Caine. I think his performance here was so much deeper and more character-driven than the other two films. In fact, there is one scene in particular, where he confesses something to Bruce, that almost moved me to tears. And this is actually TDKR’s greatest strength; unlike the other two films, this one deals much more with actual human emotions, it gives us an insight into what actually drives these characters, both heroes and villains alike. \r\n\r\nAs much as I would love to, the word-limit restricts me from elaborating more on the characters, so I'll just move on to the technical stuff. And in that department, actually pretty much everything was perfect. The pacing was very well balanced, and during those 2 ½ hours I didn't get bored once. Great action scenes alternate with more quiet moments, and the special effects are absolutely awesome. Hans Zimmer once again delivered a terrific score and there was some high quality dialogue. Also in store: a couple of great plot twists and two very cool cameos... There are a few plot holes, but everything else easily makes up for it. \r\n\r\nI highly recommend The Dark Knight Rises. It is a worthy conclusion to the trilogy, and it far exceeded my expectations.\r\n_(July 2012)_",

  "content": "Batman was one of my childhood heroes from the Comic magazines even though the Swedish plonkers, in their infinite stupidity, had renamed him to something as ridiculous “Läderlappen” which basically translates into “patch of leather”.\r\n\r\nThus, when Christopher Nolan brought us Batman Begins and steered away from the ridiculous comic shows that the previous batman movies (except the first one) had turned into I was thrilled. Unfortunately I was equally disappointed with this one.\r\n\r\nI think the title of the movie is quite misleading since Batman isn’t exactly rising at all but rather sinking. If this would have been a movie about some other “guy” it would probably have been excellent but it isn’t. It’s about Batman and as such I had expected him to be the hero going around beating up the bad guys.\r\n\r\nInstead the movie starts downright boring with Batman having dug himself down into a swamp of melancholy and closed himself off from the world. When he finally starts to appear again he gets pretty much beaten at every turn not to mention conned out of the Wayne fortune. What the f… is that? It isn’t until the end that he starts to be the real Batman and even then it’s not very exciting.\r\n\r\nActually Batman, as in Batman and not Wayne, is not really in the movie for a good chunk of the time and the real hero in this movie is really the young cop and he sure isn’t a particularly good substitute for the superhero Batman that I was expecting to watch.\r\n\r\nI was struggling with what to give this movie but in the end, since I probably would have thought it to be a good movie if it had not been labelled as a Batman movie, I gave it 5 out 10 stars. At least the special effects where quite okay.",

I really love this film and consider it one of Nolan's better works, and I wish more people on the Internet would start giving it more respect.\r\n\r\nOh, also, I really don't care about the small plot holes like the magic mechanical leg and Bruce appearing in Gotham when he was at the desert shortly before - do you really want to see ten minutes of Bruce using plastic surgery to fix his bone, or him in a airport going to Gotham?",

  "content": "Tom Hardy is superb in this denouement to Christopher Nolan's \"Batman\" trilogy. His depiction of the clever and malevolent \"Bane\" is intricate and terrifying in equal measure. Christian Bale also has the role very much under control now as he joins forces with his old pal \"Gordon\" (Gary Oldman) and jewel thief turned \"Catwoman\" (Anne Hathaway) to rise to his biggest challenge yet... What's great about this film is that is ties up all of the loose ends from the first two; it dots some i's and crosses the t's as the story neatly, and frequently quite subtly, introduces new threads to an old suit of clothes. This is an hugely characterful outing for all concerned - especially Sir Michael Caine as the wonderfully underplayed \"Alfred\" and Morgan Freeman as the arch-inventor \"Fox\". The plot takes it's time to develop, there is plenty of to-ing and fro-ing as they battle for the upper hand; new allies must learn to trust and to rely on each other. I found myself drawn to the \"Bane\" cause more than I ought to admit - a sign of a great baddie; you empathise with the evil (I think of \"Darth Vader\") especially once the story unveils traits in his character and elements of his history that, to a certain extent, justify his behaviour. The dialogue is sparing and potent and photography is really effective: the light and shade are used creatively with the Hans Zimmer score an huge improvement on his last outing. This is certainly one for a big screen - there is loads to see each time you watch, and though \"Batman\" was never my favourite super-hero, this has to be up there as one of the darkest and best super-hero films.",

  "content": "America, mid-nineteenth century, just prior to the Civil War. Winter. Two horsebacked slave-traders are leading half-a-dozen manacled negro slaves through a large, unspecified section of Texas. As they move one night through a wood, they cross paths with an affable, charming German fellow identified by the hokey model tooth affixed atop his carriage by a spring as a travelling dentist. He greets the traders cordially but he's struggling to be understood; not because English is his second language (although he deferentially concedes as much when instructed - more than once - to \"Speak English!\") but because his vocabulary is far wider than that of the simpler men here before him. It's not a chance passing, either; this German fellow, who identifies himself as Dr. King Schultz (played by Christoph Waltz with the same smiling, deadly menace that earned him an Oscar statue for his part as Col. Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds) is looking for these traders. More specifically, their inventory of negro slaves. Even more specifically, one of those slaves in particular. Django (Jamie Foxx, Collateral, Ray). Attempting to buy Django, Schultz is met with short, suspicious shrift and ordered at gunpoint to be on his way. Within a second, one trader lies dead and the other lies incapacitated underneath the bulk of his dead horse. Schultz unchains Django, instructs Django to take the dead fellow's horse and coat, and pays the remaining trader for all that he's taken. He then tosses the manacle key to the other slaves and posits two choices to them, as he sees it: Carry their injured master thirty-plus miles to the nearest town for medical assistance, or unchain themselves, blow the injured slave-trader's head off with the gun Shultz has left them, bury the corpses and use the Pole Star to run for the Northern states, where slavery had been abolished, and for more than fifty years in some areas. Funnily enough, they take up the latter option.\r\n\r\nSo begins Django Unchained, an oater set in the slave states of the Deep South and the latest rollercoaster by Gen-X movieland wunderkind Quentin Tarantino. Always clearly a man heavily informed by the grindhouse subgenre of the Spaghetti Western, he's finally made one himself, and if Quentin's your thing it's a blast, though I doubt it'll convert many Tarantino sceptics; in fact it'll almost certainly reinforce those things that people dislike about him, about which more later.\r\n\r\nIt transpires that Dr. Schultz ISN'T a dentist (\"I haven't practised dentistry in five years,\" he confides to Django over a beer) but a bounty hunter, and a lethal one at that. He's chasing down the Brittles, a murderous gang of brothers currently plying their trades as plantation overseers. He doesn't know what they look like but he knows they were recently employed at the Carrucan plantation, which is why he was searching for Django - a slave recently sold by that very plantation - in the first place; Django can point them out for him. Schultz is no fan of the South's backwards-thinking propensity for slavery though, and he offers Django a deal: help Schultz find and kill the Brittle Brothers, Schultz will treat Django like a free man, pay him $75 (a decent little wedge in 1858) and rubber-stamp his freedom. Along the way, he'll also teach Django a thing or two about the art of gunfighting and about the macabre trade of bounty-hunting (both in which Django proves to be a natural). On the trail of the Brittles, Schultz wonders aloud as to Django's plans once this endeavour is over and he's free. Well, as it happens, Django is a married man and his intention, once free, is to find his wife and buy her freedom. They'd tried to run from the Carrucan plantation together but they'd been caught, branded (both Django and his wife - played with all of her nerves exposed by Kerry Washington - sport R-For-Runaway scars on their cheeks) and sold on, separately. So he doesn't know where she is but that's what he's going to try to do. Schultz, feeling responsible for Django as the man granting him his freedom, proposes a further deal: If this Brittle bounty goes well, he'll honour Django's freedom but if Django stays with him through the winter as partners, taking on bounties and earning money, he'll help Django locate his wife.\r\n\r\nWhat we have here is a large sequence of set-pieces - some funny, some tense, some action-packed - stretched across very-nearly three hours (though, like most QT films, it moves like a bullet train and those three hours just fly) strung together by a fairly simple revenge/rescue tale set against a geographically sprawling backdrop; a reasonably similar template to many of Quentin's movies and an almost identical template to that of previous outing Inglourious Basterds, to which Django Unchained could almost be considered a companion piece despite the wildly different global and historical settings. Like Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained is quite a bit longer than the story need be, and like Inglourious Basterds that is because each scene is treated by Tarantino as a mini movie, a contained set-piece all of its own. Every scene is fleshed out and deepened for either heightened comic or dramatic effect by lengthened sequences of characters going about the mundane or by characters delivering enormous monologues - rambling shaggy-dog stories, usually - to one another, for context. Not every scene is entirely necessary, either. I wouldn't call that a flaw though, I'd call it a trait typical of Quentin Tarantino; whether it's a flaw or an outright treat depends entirely on whether that's an element of Tarantino's writing that the viewer appreciates. Personally, I love Tarantino's writer's voice and I could watch these scenes for hours (indeed, I watched Django Unchained three times over the course of yesterday), but I can fully undersand what those lamenting the decent 90-minute film that's lost somewhere within the sojourns and speeches of Django Unchained are saying.\r\n\r\nPerformances throughout are utterly mesmerising, from stars Foxx and Waltz but also - in fact, maybe more so - from principle antagonists Leonardo DiCaprio as \"Monsieur\" Calvin Candie, the horrifying owner of the \"Candyland\" plantation currently holding the ownership deeds on Django's wife, and Samuel L. Jackson in an if-anything even more monstrous role as Stephen, Candie's elderly head house slave, a man who has utterly abndoned the culture and torment of his people in return for a few material trappings as the slave-in-chief. Playing to superb comedic effect is Don Johnson as Big Daddy, a strutting, peacock-like Tennessee dandy and owner of the plantation currently employing the Brittle Brothers, and delightful in cameo roles are (among many others) James Remar (The Warriors, Dexter), Jonah Hill (Superbad, The Watch), John Jarratt (Wolf Creek, Rogue) and Michael Parks (Red State, Kill Bill). Quentin himself makes a cameo as usual and, as usual, he's not as charming as he probably thinks he is, but he's also not as bad as many think he is, either. There's even a quick cameo (raising an involuntary cheer from me!) by Franco Nero, the original Django from the magnificent 1966 film of the same name by Sergio Corbucci (that's not the only nod back to the first Django movie; the opening credits to Django Unchained are presented in exactly the same way as the original, and the theme song to Quentin's film comes directly from the Corbucci film too).\r\n\r\nDjango Unchained is likely to come under fire on a couple of counts; possibly for it's incredible levels of bloodshed (one particular gunfight is the most blood-splattered scene I've seen in a movie since those elevator doors opened in The Shining), and much more probably for the liberal use of what guilty white folks like to refer to as \"The 'N'-word\", uttered literally hundreds of times from first scene to last. However, neither criticism is warranted in my humble opinion. The bloodshed is of the overexaggerated cartoon quality. Heads, arteries and extremities explode upon bullet impact like detonated watermelons to a gloopy, \"BLAAAPP!\" sound effect, the blood itself translucent, syrupy and intentionally unrealistic. And if a tale is set against the backdrop of slavery in the 19th century deep South, you're going to hear the word \"Nigger\" in that tale. Often. Be assured though that just as Inglourious Basterds was a revenge fantasy of the downtrodden Jewish war refugees over the stupidly evil Nazi Germans, this is a tale of empowerment of the enslaved black man over his sadistic, pig-ignorant white overseers.\r\n\r\nIf you like Tarantino, you'll probably like Django Unchained. If you like Westerns (and the blood-drenched Spaghetti Westerns of the late sixties in particular), you'll probably like Django Unchained. If, like me, you're an admirer of both Tarantino AND westerns, this is a no-brainer. Get and see it, it's a blast.\r\n\r\nI'd like to have seen him pull a Gatling gun out of a coffin, though.",

  "content": "This is one of the best movies I have watched in a long time. It is a pure Tarantino blast. The somewhat unexpected and quite hilarious start of the movie catches your attention from the start and from then on it is 3 hours (almost) of pure enjoyment. \n\nThe main actors are playing their roles very well. The Dr. King Schultz character (Christop Walz) is incredibly funny without being ridiculous, Jamie Foxx is excellent as Django and Leonardo DiCaprio is doing his role well as a plantation owner and slave trader. None of the rest of the crew stood out as particularly bad. Well with the possible exception of Tarantino himself then when he made his usual in-movie appearance a’ la Hitchcock. Not that he was particularly bad but he is no actor either.\n\nThe movie starts of by Dr. Schulz liberating Django and proceeding to a small town showing Django what he is in the business of doing. Those first minutes of the movie are somewhat unexpected and very funny to watch. After that the movie gets more serious as Django gets to learn to be a bounty hunter and finally gets on with his quest to rescue his “Damsel in distress”. It still has quite a bit of “Tarantino humour” sprinkled around in it though.\n\nDuring the movie we are treated to a long series of stereotypical people with, let us say, an “attitude” towards African people. It is tempting to say “nigger haters” but that would not be true since a lot of these people did not exactly hate them. They just did not consider African people to be people but more than live stock for them to use as they wished. Unlike a lot of movies portraying these events this one never comes across as boringly finger pointing or overly morally lecturing. Nor does it in any way support or glorify the way things were at this time. It is a movie made to entertain set in a period where bad shit happened and using it for the story. Nothing more and nothing less.\n\nAs usual with a Tarantino movie there are some violent parts, some more violent parts and some bloody violent parts in it. The ending fights are a glorious show of destruction and blood splatter. I am sure some people are complaining about the “unnecessary violence”. I am not one of those people. Without these parts it would not be a real Tarantino movie. As always it is made with the usual exaggeration that Tarantino is so good and which reminds you that it is “only a movie”.\nThis is one of the few movies that I have given 10 out of 10 stars in a very long time. I enjoyed it immensely.",

  "content": "When Django is unchained (pronounced JANG-oh, not Duh-JANG-oh)\r\n\r\nReleased in 2012 and directed & written by Quentin Tarantino, \"Django Unchained\" stars Christoph Waltz as an ex-dentist who befriends an ex-slave, Django (Jamie Foxx) in West Texas a couple of years before the Civil War; they team-up as bounty hunters once they realize how good they jell. The second half focuses on their attempt to infiltrate a Mississippi plantation owned by pompous Southerner \"Monsieur\" Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) in order to rescue Django's wife (Kerry Washington). Samuel L. Jackson plays Candie's overly loyal house slave.\r\n\r\nThis is an excellent American Western with Spaghetti Western elements featuring Tarantino's typical artistic flourishes. It takes place in the West AND in the South, which is reminiscent of the underrated \"Nevada Smith\" (1966), one of my favorite Westerns. Waltz is magnetic as the nonchalant protagonist and he & Foxx have good chemistry. There's a nice mix of interesting dialogues, amusing moments and over-the-top action. Unfortunately, but to be expected, Tarantino goes overboard with the 'n' word and the blood-letting, the latter to the point of cartoonish-ness. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, this is an original Western that is vibrant with creativity, including stunning locations, cinematography and a great amalgamated soundtrack/score, which includes cuts by Ennio Morricone, like the excellent \"Hornets' Nest,\" the imaginative \"The Braying Mule\" and the moving \"Ancora Qui.\" It's all-around superior to \"The Hateful Eight\" (2015) because it's not limited by a one-room whodunit plot (although \"Hateful\" has its unique points of interest).\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 165 minutes and was shot in Jackson Hole, Wyoming; Evergreen Plantation & New Orleans, Louisiana; and several locations in California (Lone Pine, Alabama Hills, Semi Valley, Melody Ranch, Santa Clarita, Independence & Los Angeles). The cast includes numerous peripheral notables, e.g. Ato Essandohs, Don Stroud, James Remar, Bruce Dern, Ato Essandoh, Franco Nero, Don Johnson, Amber Tamblyn and several others.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A",

It would have been easy to present many of the characters as stereotypical, but the script avoided that. The DiCaprio slave owner is vicious and cruel, but there are flashes of flexibility concerning the status quo with his slaves. And his elderly house slave  seems to act more like a slave owner than he does.\r\n\r\nA chemistry develops between the two lead characters as they work as bounty hunters, and that is satisfying to see. There are the usual sometimes subtle nods to other films, and I felt the influence of Spaghetti Westerns here and there.\r\n\r\nAs I said, I enjoyed the film, even though I won’t be watching it multiple times as I do with other Tarantino movies.

  "content": "I'm looking for the owner of that horse. He's tall, blonde, he smokes a cigar, and he's a pig!\r\n\r\nIt's debatable of course, since there are legions of fans of the first two films in Sergio Leone's Dollars Trology, but with each film there not only came a longer running time, but also a rise in quality - debatable of course!\r\n\r\nHere for the third and final part of the trilogy, Leone adds Eli Wallach to the established pairing of Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood, and brings all his tools of the trade to the party. Plot is slight, the three principals are on a collision course to find some buried gold, with each man having varying degrees of scuzziness, so how will it pan out?\r\n\r\nSuch is the genius of the narrative, it's a fascinating journey to undertake. The characterisations are ripe and considered, the various traits and peccadilloes beautifully enhanced, and with Leone being Leone, there's no shortage of cruelty and humour. He also brings his style, the close ups, long shots and some outstanding framing of characters in various situations.\r\n\r\nThe story encompasses The Civil War, which pitches our leads into \"The Battle of Branston Bridge\", where here we get to see just how great Leone was at constructing full on battle sequences. It's exciting, thrilling and literally dynamite, whilst Aldo Giuffrè as Captain Clinton turns in some memorable support.\r\n\r\nThe Euro locations pass muster as the Wild West, superbly photographed by Tonino Delli Colli, and then of course there is Ennio Morricone's musical compositions. It's a score that has become as iconic as Eastwood's Man With No Name, a part of pop culture for ever more. It mocks the characters at times, energises them at others, whilst always us the audience are aurally gripped.\r\n\r\nThere's obviously some daft coincidences, this is after all pasta world, and the near three hour run time could be construed as indulgent. But here's the thing, those who love The Good, The Bad and the Ugly could quite easily stand for another hour of Leone's classic. I mean, more barbed dialogue, brutal violence and fun! Great, surely!\r\n\r\nFrom the sublime arcade game like opening credit sequences, to the legendary cemetery stand-off at the finale, this is a Western deserving of the high standing it is held. 9/10",

  "content": "Sergio Leone's <i>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</i> is a classic Western film. Clint Eastwood is the Good, aka the Man with No Name, a taciturn wanderer who follows his own sense of justice. His opposite is Angel Eyes (Lee van Cleef), the Bad, a brutal mercenary who kills anyone who stands in the way of making ready cash. The film's comic relief is Tuco (Eli Wallach), the Ugly, a Mexican bandit wanted in several states who ends up inadvertently doing some good turns. At the height of the Civil War, as Union and Confederate armies battle each other in the West, these three men vie for an abandoned cache of gold coins.\r\n\r\nThe film is especially memorable for its pace and cinematography. The opening scene, for example, juxtaposes closeups of anxious faces with vast panoramas of the Western landscape, and 10 minutes passes before a single word is said. It is like Tarkovsky transplanted to a vastly different setting. That's not to say it's all so serious, though. In a sense the film is a \"two buddies on the road\" movie, with Tuco the wisecracker and Eastwood's character the straight man. It is also a war film, with Leone apparently sparing no expense in presenting a realistic image of hundreds of men charging each other on the battlefield. This is not among the greatest films I've ever seen, but it's very well-made.\r\n\r\nBecause this is a \"spaghetti Western\", an effort in the genre realized by a joint Italian-Spanish production team with American lead actors, the film has some curious qualities. Because of the use of locals, all the faces of Civil War soldiers are so clearly Italian, even though Italian immigration into the US picked up only later. The Mexican bandit Tuco is played by a Jew from New York, and furthermore Leone mocks the character's Catholicism in a way that Americans of the era would, although the faith would be in no way foreign to his Italian audience.",

  "content": "I am not a fan of Sergio Leone. In fact, this movie and Once Upon a Time in the West are the only movies of his that I have seen. But I think they are both classic westerns. He seems to bring out the best in his cinematographer, both for scenery and for his characters.\r\n\r\nIn one review I read, he was criticized for staying with facial close-ups too long, and I would probably agree if he populated his movies with beautiful actors and actresses as many films do, but he relies heavily upon actors with interesting faces.\r\n\r\nSometimes I feel he relies on too many shootings, and on having his gunfighters be too damn good. Two, four, six opponents? Doesn’t matter, these guys kill them all and come out unscathed.  But that is part of the western movie gunfighter mystique.\r\n\r\nOn a different level, I have owned the soundtrack for this movie: The Good the Bad and the Ugly, for close to 50 years. I write novels in my spare time, and I started listening to this soundtrack (plus others like Thunderball) for background music as I wrote. I moved on to Ambient music, such as Brian Eno, but still listen to this album. As a side note, I heard a great version of this movie music on YouTube, performed by the Danish National Orchestra. Check it out.\r\n\r\nSo the movie works for me on multiple levels, and I own a copy so I can watch it any time the mood strikes me",

  "content": "There is one word to define The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. And that word is “transcendent”. This movie is not only the pinnacle of the Spaghetti Western, but it transcended into the pinnacle of the Western genre in itself. It’s safe to say it transcends that too, and can be considered one of the greatest pieces of filmmaking ever. It counts with memorable performances by three different leads, a story that breaks the “black and white” concepts of morale, and an original score that can only be defined by the word “epic”.\r\n\t\r\nDirected by the man responsible for the revitalization of the western in Italy, Sergio Leone, the film does an incredible job of introducing every character, and showing each and every one has a dubious concept of moral values. “The Bad”, Sentenza, or Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), is shown to be a ruthless, greedy gun for hire, but also someone who lives by the mantra of always getting the job done. “The Ugly”, Tuco, is a  greedy backstabber, but he is also a man who comes from an extremely poor environment and family conflicts, showing a bit of determinism in the film. “The Good”, Blondie (Clint Eastwood) is not much better himself. While he is surely the less greedy one, he also has no problem with killing and backstabbing other people. To put it in perspective, he is ironically announced as “The Good” right after abandoning a man to die in the desert.\r\n\t\r\nThe story follows all these three personalities as they engage in their particular gold rush: a buried treasure that is hidden in a cemetery. In order to find it, they must form an uneasy alliance, while trying to outrun each other, and claim the prized gold alone. All of this while the Civil War happens around them.\r\n\t\r\nThe performances are nothing short of amazing. It goes to show the range that Lee Van Cleef had once this villainous role is compared to his work in the previous installment of the trilogy, For a Few Dollars More, as a heroic, friendly and almost fatherly figure. His presence is as intimidating as ever, and one of the best he has given in his lengthy career. Eastwood is as eye-catching as one would expect: his deep stares and lines delivered in a whispery, yet gravelly voice, defined The Man With No Name. But the best of the bunch has to be Eli Wallach. His comedic timing is as precise as any bullet shot in this film. But the most outstanding part of his characterization is that while he is extremely funny, he also manages to be a credible threat for the “hero”, Blondie.\r\n\t\r\nThe original music score for this film deserves a whole book just to talk about it, and it still wouldn’t do it justice. It’s simply a lesson by the maestro, Ennio Morricone, on how music can change a film. Thanks to a track such as L’estasi dell’oro (The Ecstasy of Gold), a man running around a cemetery becomes one of the most epic scenes ever made. Thanks to a composition such as Il Triello, three men staring at each other, pondering their options for almost seven minutes straight, becomes tense enough to have the viewer on the edge of its seat. There is simply no other way to put it: Morricone crafted one of the best scores in this art’s history.\r\n\t\r\nAt the end of the day, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is more than just a great western film. It’s a show of great acting, writing, directing and music scoring. It’s a real once in a lifetime classic, that has been around for a long time, and not aged a little bit, and will still be talked about for generations of cinephiles to come. To conclude, all I can say is… There are two kinds of people, my friend. Those who have watched this film, and those who have not. You watch.",

Any cons noted are relative.\r\n\r\nI just feel like it's a drop-off from the brilliant double of <em>'A Fistful of Dollars'</em> and <em>'For a Few Dollars More'</em>. The near 3hr run time is one of the reasons, though the pacing is actually pretty good in fairness. I guess it's more so the plot, which is filled with an American Civil War setting which I didn't feel matched the characters.\r\n\r\nThe man in the middle/bounty hunting aspects of the original two films are perfect for the characters of Clint Eastwood & Co., whereas them tagging along for the war just felt odd; the story didn't feel as raw or volatile to me.\r\n\r\nAs stated, it's still - on its own merits - an entertaining western. Eastwood remains quality, while Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach are extremely worthy onscreen counterparts. I will say Van Cleef feels forgotten about, probably just by me, towards the end until he magically reappears. Still, as a trio they are really enjoyable. The plot away from the war is properly fun, much more in keeping to what I was expecting. The score is also awesome, yet again.\r\n\r\nMinus the ACW and a shorter run time and I'd probably be classing this as great as AFOD and FAFDM. It's still very good though, which I evidently want to stress, and I'd definitely revisit it.\r\n\r\n<em>watched: \"Extended English-language version\".<br>\r\nEven though this version is the same as the original Italian release (177 minutes), but seemingly the US shortened run time is considered the true incarnation?

I think most people agree with me on that, and for some people he saves the show, but I need better writing, and more \"credible characters in incredible circumstances\" than we get with Leone.\r\nBlondie (Eastwood) kills anyone he sees in the wild. He kills other bounty hunters to steal their prisoner to bring in for rewards.\r\nIt's a good thing we didn't have Allied soldiers like Blondie, or else all Germans would have to do to win the war would be surrender and let American GIs kill each other to steal prisoners to bring in. Imagine that. We would have lost WW2 if our soldiers were like Blondie (or Manko, or whatever his name was).\r\nThe attempts to humanize the homicidal maniacs played by Clint and Eli only work for the brain dead idiots who buy into that. Such brain dead idiots don't last long in the hood or in volatile situations. Sadists do not get human. They only act human at times to get innocent victims to lower their guard.\r\nThe three man shootout at the end is stolen from the pair of movies \"The Jackal\" and \"Yellow Sky\", and I'm not sure if it's better or not. Neither one is in a top one hundred all time movie gunfights or showdowns. It's weak and stupid.\r\nBut when the spaghetti Westerns came out, the drug abusers and potheads loved them, and demanded they be acclaimed. The critics were either scared of the druggies or were druggies themselves, because the critics were bigger hacks than Leone for praising this garbage. \r\nHow long will we endure the crack head idolization of this garbage? Probably another 30 years or so, until we get some mature viewers who are willing to make up their own minds about what is classic, instead of being sheep.\r\nYep, Eli spoke of sheep in another Western, but it fits here.\r\nI give it a grade on a curb to make it 3/10, although compared to 1950s Westerns it is 1/10, but I'm lenient, because it isn't as bad as the other Leone Westerns. It isn't exactly \"watchable\", and you will fall asleep if you take it in one viewing, but the other Leone Westerns are even more boring than this one. Eli Wallach does do a great job, and for some people, that's enough.",

  "content": "**One of the best, most famous and most iconic Westerns ever. More than a classic, it's mandatory.**\r\n\r\nI'm not an expert nor do I want to sound like one, but I think this is one of the most famous western films ever made, despite being shot by an Italian director and being more European than American. Sérgio Leone was one of the most notable directors of his time and he left us, in this film, one of his masterpieces.\r\n\r\nThis is one of those movies that is almost perfect. Problems and failures are scarce and reside in minimal details that end up not making a big difference in the overall work. The story was very well written and takes place in the midst of the American Civil War, a time when violence was part of everyday life. In this environment of violence and mutual distrust, two men are looking for a treasure buried in a cemetery: the problem is the fact that each one knows only part of the location (that is, one knows the location of the cemetery and the other knows which grave it is) and there is a third man, a fearsome assassin, willing to do anything to take all the gold.\r\n\r\nFor this film, Leone put together a very reasonable cast, mostly European, and three great North American actors with enormous talent: Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef. I believe that they knew how to make the most intelligent and skilful use of this film, giving us a truly remarkable job. For this three actors, this is the best cinematographic work of their career, or one of the best, consecrating them as great Western movies actors. The film, however, seems to give Wallach more and better opportunities. While watching it, I got the feeling that he is the actor who receives most attention and best material, in addition to having known how to improvise at the right moments and in creative and intelligent ways.\r\n\r\nThe film has great visual beauty, emphasized by the cinematography, the filming work and the good choice and design of sets and costumes. At a time when the correct period recreation was something that cinema sometimes blatantly ignored, this film did the opposite, giving us a realistic and believable vision of the past and placing the film in a specific place and time. I'm not saying it was a one hundred percent successful effort, but it was definitely a decisive step in the right direction when it comes to period films. The special effects and visuals are excellent, the best there was then, and the whole film has an epic, grandiose, expensive feel. It is also very long, with almost three hours in length, but it is worth not being afraid or giving up on because of that. Being a Western film, it is quite evident that there is a lot of violence, so it is not a film for children. Even so, it is not gratuitous violence. Finally, we owe Ennio Morricone a salute for the excellent soundtrack he composed. Among his vast work, this is not my favorite nor the best, but it is undoubtedly one of the most recognizable and iconic pieces, a work that we know, even without having seen this film, and that has become part of our collective memory. We can't ask for more than that.",

A good-looking, calculating Clint Eastwood (\"The Good\"), is the itinerant bounty hunter who has an uneasy partnership with a scene-stealing Eli Wallach (\"The Ugly) to trick the local authorities of the reward money due for his capture before escaping and dividing the spoils. After a bit of duplicity that rather erodes what little trust there ever was between them - and some very timely cannon fire - they happen upon a recently robbed stagecoach where they learn of the whereabouts of a huge stash of gold - but they both possess different clues as to the location, so must - despite themselves - work together to track down the loot. Meantime, a thoroughly nasty Lee Van Cleef (“The Bad\") hears about their treasure hunt and is now joined in the race to the money. There is a paucity of dialogue that only enhances their performances - there are bouts of humour and although the premiss is pretty violent, there is actually very little by way of grisly, gory, depiction seen on screen. The scene near the end in the graveyard with the magnificent Morricone \"Ecstacy of Gold\" theme is as good as Westerns get. The editing is not great, it has to be said - but the cinematography gives a great showcase to the scale and grandeur of the locations.

  "content": "When you have to shoot, shoot. Don’t talk. 70% (ish) \r\n\r\n This is the third in a so-called ‘trilogy’, a framing which I expressed doubts about in my review for the second in the sequence, “For a few dollars more”. So, from my perspective it’s a matter of complete indifference as to how many in this ‘trilogy’ you see and in what order you watch them. That being said, if you watch all three films you will observe the tropes that are common to this ‘trilogy’. In this one the plot concerns three men on the make who end up chasing a fortune in gold during the American Civil War (American history is not my forte, so looking at Wikipedia for the span of this war, I’d guess that it takes place towards the tail end of it, in the mid 1860s). The three men on the make are referred to in the film’s title. Skim reading Wikipedia’s entry for this film, there is an interesting thing to note about the title: “In the theatrical trailer, Angel Eyes is referred to as The Ugly and Tuco, The Bad. This is due to a translation error; the original Italian title translates to \"The Good [one], the Ugly [one], the Bad [one]\"”. That quote misses ‘the good one’, which, in this case, is Clint Eastwood’s character of ‘Blondie’. I’m using scare quotes for his name because it’s a nickname and also a trope of this trilogy, in that he always plays a character whose name we aren’t sure of, whether we think we know it or not. Lee Van Cleef plays ‘the ugly one’ and Eli Wallach plays ‘the bad one’. \r\n\r\n “The good, the bad and the ugly” returns to the opening title style of the first film, “A fistful of dollars”, initially, at least. Here you’ll get Ennio Morricone’s famous composition which is, musically, at least, his most accomplished, as in you’d want to get the soundtrack for this film because it is so good as a piece of music (it’s an earworm!). His score for the previous film worked better as a soundtrack for a film, as in it heightened tension or what have you. When Eastwood’s character is revealed (or at least the back of his head, while he is smoking), that famous score plays. That seemed to tie it to him but it would later repeat for the character of Tuco. I’m not sure what we are meant to glean from the fact that the phrase “Directed by Sergio Leone” is in three different fonts! The opening titles have a letterbox aspect which is dropped for the rest of the film, as was the case with the earlier films. \r\n\r\n Back to the tropes of this film, there is the visual style of Eastwood. It looked as though his stylistic trope of wearing a poncho would not occur in this film but it did towards the end. As I noted for Eastwood’s character in the previous film, I would say the same thing about Lee Van Cleef’s character for this one: he’s not the same person in both films. Once again you eventually get something resembling a visual trope for him, after thinking it wouldn’t occur: his pipe smoking. Lastly, going on the two previous films, you would expect there to be a main villain of the piece. Maybe I thought it was (or might be) Gian Maria Volonté but he is ‘replaced’ by Eli Wallach. Wikipedia does mention that Volonté was considered for the role but Leone wanted to cast someone who could add a different dimension to the character. Having him in all three films would have made for interesting processing of what this kind of casting means for the trilogy. In any case, perhaps it’s a nice symmetry with Eastwood being the constant and Volonté and Van Cleef being either side of the trilogy for two films. \r\n\r\n Some of the dialogue in this film did catch my attention, as it did in the first film. Both of these films would make good material for a high school subject like history or media studies or what have you. Amongst the meaty dialogue in this film are lines like: (an official reading the charges against a condemned man) “raping a virgin of the white race; statutory rape of a minor of the black race”; a business man speaks of the Confederates: “as soon as these cowards hear a blue shirt is around, they run. These rebels have no will to fight. They’ll soon be finished. We get rid of these bastards, then we begin making money on those Yankees. They carry gold, not paper dollars and they’re going to defeat the South”; a Confederate sergeant says: “the only thing we care about is saving our own hides”. \r\n\r\n In my reviews I’ve noted the sense of humour of Eastwood’s characters. In the first film it is playful. In the second it is guarded (maybe I should have used that word there!). Here it is cruel (in an early scene). This is just another demonstration to me that Eastwood is not playing the same character in all three films. Of all the three films, Eastwood’s character is the most unpleasant here, which makes his designation as “the good” (in a postmodern fashion by Leone, using on-screen text) as seemingly ironic. When he calls Tuco a “greasy rat”, it makes me wonder if there is an ethnic dimension to the choice of villains in all three films. That might be a meta observation of the trilogy by me though. Some of the humour isn’t intended as cruel though. For instance, there is a funny scene where ‘Blondie’ and Tuco wonder what side of the civil war an approaching cavalry is on. Another scene with Tuco, in a prison camp, brought to mind a scene in the film Pretty Woman, which was played for laughs. ‘Blondie’ is definitely a dodgy character and his scheme at the start of the film is novel (to me) although I do wonder about continuity errors as far as his partner in crime goes. Their seemingly first meeting doesn’t really square with what happens later. How Blondie is seen to become partners in crime with this person also illustrates how odious his character is. \r\n\r\n Another major aspect of this film is its depiction of war. It made me question whether it was being used a prop. Is what the film saying about war merely glib? War isn’t glorified here in any case. Perhaps it’s not odd that I found some scenes of war being taken to a town had echoes in what is currently happening around the world. The makeup used to depict war injuries strikes me as having a realistic look to it. In a more oblique manner, I did note the use of targets in a shooting range looking like Native Americans. It’s such a throwaway moment but it struck me, as did similar moments in the first film, concerning Native Americans. \r\n\r\n Of the three films in this ‘trilogy’, this is the one that I’m scoring the lowest. All of the films had their moments which strained credulity or buggered belief. It’s just that for this one, it really went beyond pushing the envelope for me. Even though Eastwood’s character’s entrance into the final showdown of the first film was unbelievable, I still found it satisfying for its mythic quality. This unbelievability just increases from film to film in an unsatisfying way. One example of that is the depiction of the captain at Branson Bridge. His behaviour just didn’t seem grounded in reality. I’m not including the fact that he looks swarthy, as do most of the soldiers on the Confederate side, for some reason. It was filmed in Europe, especially Spain, so I won’t hold that against them. Generally speaking, I just didn’t find the main characters believable in how they related to one another, given their history. As a side note, this film had a non-linear feel to it but I suppose that the ugly one’s search for Carson is a thread. \r\n\r\n Of the ‘trilogy’, I’d say that the first is the one that I’d most likely revisit again sometime. The second one, maybe, after a long absence. The third film is much longer but it’s not for that reason that it doesn’t feel to me like something that I’d be interested in revisiting, although it does have its moments. My thoughts on what I should score this range from 75% (no + sign meaning I give it 7 out of 10 stars on a site where you can’t give half stars) to maybe 67.5% if I’m feeling unaccommodating. 72.5% or 72.5+% isn’t unreasonable but maybe I’ll just stick to what this site gives me, 7 out 10 stars?\r\n\r\nRandom notes:\r\n\r\n^ I viewed the “Extended English language version” which had a “2003 restoration and remastering”.

Running time of 2:51:15 without the six lots of ads during the film (measured from the start of the MGM lion’s roar to to the end, being after the trademark still of the lion, which, for the first time, didn’t have a lion’s roar), which brings the running time up to 3:11:51. I must say that I appreciated the fact that SBS didn’t play ads during the lead up to the ending (the last ad ended 2:26:04 on the unedited film). Audio Described and Closed Captions. It was rated M for adult themes and violence. I viewed this film over two days, from 23/11/2024 and made these notes. I started writing this review on 07/12/2024 up to here and a bit more. Another first for this trilogy is the inclusion of end credits.\r\n\r\n^ The option for Closed Captions was appreciated by me but I still found an online site with the script to refer to at times. SBS’ captions (I presume it was theirs) were good. For instance, whilst the online site didn’t include Spanish utterances, SBS’ did and I got a strong language translation when I typed it into a translation app on my PC. Sometimes the online script had words which the CC didn’t. Sometimes the online script had the right word and the CC didn’t. \r\n\r\n^ Once again, I hear what sort of sounds like words in Morricone’s score, in this case “Go, go, go, echo”. He has actually composed music which features lyrics for this film: “The story of a soldier” and those lyrics were written by Tommie Connor. \r\n\r\n^ Not sure if Tuco’s sign of the cross is correct...which might be the point, perhaps.\r\n\r\n^ Interesting casting for the first character we come across called “Shorty”. I wonder what his story was. Wikipedia doesn’t answer that question but interestingly I see that he is yet another actor who has appeared elsewhere in this trilogy...and you’d think that I would have definitely remembered seeing him before!\r\n\r\n^ Lee Van Cleef seems to have at least one thing in common with Dave Allen...part of his finger is missing!\r\n\r\nAnyway, it’s interesting that the film delays returning actor’s props from the previous films in the trilogy: Eastwood starts out wearing a trench coat in this film before taking a poncho at the end (by the way, I liked the cinematography of that scene at the cemetery with Tuco) and Van Cleef is only later seen with a smoking pipe. This review submitted late 11/12/2024, AEST. \r\n\r\nP.S. Having now looked at the ponchos in all three films, it looks to me that they are the same. Now, maybe this style of poncho was ten a penny back in the day but it seems to me that this stylistic thread between all three films...and I'm not sure what it's meant to signify...because I'm not treating all the characters that Clint Eastwood plays as being the same person.",

  "content": "We certainly get the inside joke about wanting to skewer something as raucous and ridiculous as lambasting nonsensical and numbing grade B horror flicks that are worthy of such scrutiny. After all, the temptation is just too much to resist in not exposing such throwaway thrills of intentional insipidness, correct? Plus, incorporating a mixture of smarmy filth and frolic involving menacing zombies, hormonal teens, bouncy bimbos and any other fright-driven clichés that one can think immediately off-the-cuff should be enough to satisfy the creepy concoction of craziness, right? Well wrong...especially when the experimental goosebump gags fall flat and feel synthetically repetitive in the over-indulgent and inane fear farce Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse. \r\n\r\nSure, some will automatically gravitate to the outlandish Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse and invite the spirit of the movie's manufactured foolishness as an elaborate playful put-on. In many ways, co-writer/director Christopher Landon wants to promote the silly-coated salaciousness of his teasing teen-oriented terror tale with a sly wink and anticipates that the audience will embrace Zombie Apocalypse as an unconventional, naughty-minded tangy treat for giddy thrill-seekers. Sure, Landon's off-kilter humor horror show is meant as an escapist ruse and wears its badge of honor as a brain-dead flesh-and-blood fright fable garnering cheap chuckles. Nevertheless, Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse feels relentlessly lazy, mean-spirited and connects as a raunchy wasteland of sluggish juvenile jolts and jabs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no excuse for Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse to present such a witless,  misplaced macabre mess. In an age where spoofing zombie flicks in cinema can be high-minded and heralded in both creepiness and creativity in the shadows of such riotous offerings as Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland, it is inexplicable how something like the rancid and toothless Zombie Apocalypse can be so arbitrarily clueless and contemptible in its strained search for crafting off-balance laughs. Again, it is realized that zombie cinema--however serious or silly-minded--is not exactly on the food chain of being considered a viable selection for the American Film Institute anytime soon. Still, there should at least have been some sense of smartness and perception injected in the aimless zaniness that Zombie Apocalypse emits routinely in its languished lunacy. Instead, Landon and his fellow screenwriters invite a series of empty-minded shock value shrills to the proceedings and hopes that the viewers will embrace the cluttered chaos without question. Sadly, some will do just that (read: the indiscriminate teen demo in general) as they will go with the flow and bask in the baseless swamp of tasteless titillation. Consequently, Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse is about as adventurous, amusing and intriguing as a medieval stoning in a rural town square.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse needs the approval of its boys locker room impishness to feature such graphic and goofy-minded displays of sexual body part piercings to pad the already morose stupidity put forth in desperate vain. If your idea of horror-minded high jinks include the subjection of zombie-related severed penises and constant groping of female breasts then guess what...Zombie Apocalypse will certainly satisfy one's hormonal guilty pleasures in a heartbeat. In addition, it pays to also have some stunt casting and add to the dumb cheekiness where the likes of the once celebrated Oscar and Emmy-winning veteran actress Cloris Leachman serves as the token oldster to certify the gimmicky warped proceedings (perhaps Leachman's former Mary Tyler Moore Show co--star in the beloved pop cultural and iconic Betty White was not available to sign on the dotted line for this teen terror train-wreck?).\r\n\r\nThe premise, while highlighting the gore and boyhood gratification of wet dreams, involves a group of youngsters that belong to a scouting organization while being taught the efficiency of  leadership and self-reliance. Naturally, these boys will put their merit badges to the test as they must combat the overflowing presence of threatening zombies that are infiltrating their small community. Not only must these adolescents learn to battle each other competitively and tackle their own nagging growing pains but know they must band together and slaughter the walking dead menaces that look to make some serious ominous waves within their bedroom town.\r\n\r\nThe teenage terminators that are called into action are Ben, Carter and Augie (played by Tye Sheridan, Logan Miller and Joey Morgan). Of course this trio fits into the distinctive archetype of youth labeling. Ben is the clean cut kid with some semblance of sensibility. Carter is a handful as the insufferable horndog. Lastly, Augie is the geeky hanger-on. So there you have it--the mini-sized Three Musketeers out to destroy some zombie butt and take down numbers in the process. \r\n\r\nThe feminine eye candy wrapped up in this monstrous madness includes Carter's sister Kendall (Halston Sage). Kendall also serves as the convenient object of affection for the love-struck Ben. And what would a horror flick be without the resident curvaceous gun-toting, butt-kicking beauty with the killer instinct of zombie zapping?  In this case, that role would go to strip club siren Denise (Sarah Dumont) whose skill in eradicating the zombie pests as she struts around like an armed jiggly cheerleader in heat becomes increasingly distracting (or maybe not for some that might find this bombastic and busty Barbie Doll lustfully \"liberating\"). \r\n\r\nThe boys' scout leader (former Saturday Night Live alum David Koechner) is the accident-prone wonder whose penchant for overcoming various injuries is supposedly laughable yet the joke of his clumsy confrontations quickly tires out and grows old. However, the scout leader is essential to the storyline for the tykes because he suffers the fate of becoming one of the zombies that needs to be destroyed. It certainly does not help matters any when poor Kendall's safety is jeopardized and the boys (especially Ben in particular) along with Denise's assisted brashness must rescue Carter's pretty sibling and protect the town's masses from the zombie intruders.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse is a woefully tepid tease that does not care much about its sloppy execution. The scattershot script constructed by Landon and fellow scribers Carrie Evans, Emi Mochizuki and Lona Williams vacillates back and forth in complete cartoonish chaos and it is never clear as to why any of us would want to put stock in hoping that the periled protagonists of this banal roguish romp emerge victorious? The combination of humor, sentimental vibes and sketchy scare tactics overlap and is perceived as annoyingly inconsistent. The deplorable and disposable foundation for the sexual depiction of the females in Zombie Apocalypse is insulting and does not invite any sense of truth or revelation besides flashing feminine skin for the sake of giving this horror hiccup some trivial sauciness. The hoards of zombies being butchered in some imaginative selective scenes is at first kind of challenging in an offbeat, exaggerated sort of sinister way. The repetitive slaughtering gradually becomes off-putting and you are left wondering rather or not you were better off chopping off your own limbs for enduring this boisterous bomb in the first place. \r\n\r\nHopelessly choppy and chintzy, Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse could have been stunningly irreverent and still carried out its nuttiness with a coherent slice of clever mockery attached to its brand of mayhem. The zombies genre seems all the rage now within today's pop cultural climate. Of course with the continued disconnected gory gumption of damaged duds such as Apocalypse the future invitation of visiting the zombie zone in entertainment may become as extinct as the dinosaur. \r\n\r\nScouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse (2015)\r\n\r\nParamount Pictures\r\n\r\n1 hr. 33 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Tye Sheridan, Logan Miller, Joey Morgan, Sarah Dumont, David Koechner, Halston Sage, Cloris Leachman, Patrick Schwartzenegger\r\n\r\nDirected and Co-Written by: Christopher Landon\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Horror and Suspense\r\n\r\nCritic's rating: * 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng (2015)",

In the opening scene itself convinced me that it's going to be aggressive as the progression commence. Yeah, it lived up to my last minute expectation. A fine time pass movie for the regular audience, definitely it won't suits for the critics' viewing.\r\n\r\nWhen the three friends find virus outbreak in their town that turns everyone into zombies, they plan to make into a safe place along saving a few others in their attempt. Surely this is what every zombie movie you have seen dealt with. The same old adventure in zombie theme, but the characters and the scenarios were different with lots of fun. I was surprised at that part, surely a cult status will be tagged for it.\r\n\r\nOverall movie was decent, but being a horror-comedy was its strength. Just leave the logics behind and enjoy the entertainment it offers. In the end you will be convinced for your patience. It is the movie you might like it, but can't give full marks. One of the many reasons was, it is not a mainstream actor or the filmmaker's film. But still the entire team was awesome, and delivered its purpose. It was not a box office hit, but still I expect there will be a sequel.\r\n\r\n7/10",

Dark humor abounds,\r\nbullets rip through head and bodies, and Wick is unstoppable.\r\n\r\nThis film should be held as the gold standard for action movies. There is very little camera shake during fights and Reeves clearly has spent a lot of time preparing for this role. You can see nearly every take-down, every gunshot, and Wick has to reload at inconvenient times in a realistic fashion which also adds to the hilarity of the following kills.\r\n\r\nOverall the acting performances were solid. Reeves isn't known for having an extremely wide range, but his devotion to making this movie a kick-ass martial arts production is second to none. I felt the villain was a bit on the weak side though, but he did his role justice. Ian McShane's character remains the strongest especially combined with the last film.\r\n\r\nThe lighting is superb! There's a red-blue theme that is in nearly every nightclub and darkly lit areas and its absolutely lovely to look at. Overall cinematography is very good.\r\n\r\nDefinitely worth seeing!",

  "content": "I was really hoping I would like this movie. I so enjoyed the first one. However, when the credits started to roll at the end I found myself wondering “What the fuck happened?”.\r\n\r\nBe warned that the rest of this review might contain a spoiler or two.\r\n\r\nOne thing I really liked about the first movie was, as you can read in my review about that one,  that it was a no bullshit, kill the bad guys and no emotional regrets, kind of movie. John Wick went all out for revenge and at the same time we got introduced into this cool world of assassins, safe havens, hidden “shops” for guns, classy tailors providing bullet proof costumes etc. etc.\r\n\r\nIn this movie he is forced onto a job by a real asshole. He is constantly reluctant and walks around with a sad puppy face all the time. Of course said asshole screws him halfway through the movie and that would have been a good time to start get back on track with some decent payback story but unfortunately the script writers thought otherwise. After some more of the same shit no one really wins in the end (although one of the two adversaries suffer a more “permanent” setback than the other).\r\n\r\nWorse is that, in my opinion, in their eager to put together some crap drama this movie essentially screwed up the possibilities for a John Wick 3 unless they pull some rather big surprise rabbit out of the hat for that one.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of action in the movie of course but also her I feel that it was a bit too over the top. No one, absolutely no one, seems to be able to shoot straight except for John Wick. This makes the action feel more like a parody a’la Kill Bill than a more serious action, revenge movie. Yes it is cool to watch but only up to a point. Heck, if this would have been a Star Trek (TOS) episode Hollywood’s entire supply of red shirts would have been used up on a single movie. While I am bitching I should perhaps also mention that the amount of beating that John Wick seems to be able to absorb is … unbelievable.\r\n\r\nI did enjoy the movie but not at all as much as I hoped I would. To me it has a completely different spirit than what I remember from the first one and the ending is, again to me at least, not a happy one.\r\n\r\nHaving said that the action sequences are as cool, crazy but cool, and violent as they are unbelievable. I found it a bit sad that they wrecked his nice car though.\r\n\r\nOverall a enjoyable movie but no match for the first chapter and I cannot bring myself to give it more than 3 out of 5 stars.",

The first film was good, completely an unexpected, but I was expecting this one, even though not as much as I was excited to see 'Jack Reacher 2'. That film was good, but did not meet with its first film's merit. And this sequel, really amazing. One of best follow-up flick and better than the original. That feat considered very rare in cinema and here is the one.\r\n\r\nEntirely different than the first. I meant the storyline. A new action, a new adventure, and even on a bigger scale. Though the initial parts were average. I totally disliked that killing assignment Mr. Wick took in his hand, but what followed after made the film great, definitely not to be missed for that alone. Especially if you are an ardent action film fan. For me, that reminded me 'Kill Bill', but they are not the same kind, except the fighting concept with hundreds.\r\n\r\nContinued from a couple of days later where the previous narration had ended. Now the retired assassin, John Wick forced to take a final job, but soon he finds he was backstabbed. Every eye on the town on him and every gun pointing at him, there's no way he could get out of it easily. So, he has to fight them all, just in order to survive. Then what comes later are even more aggressive screenplay that's ends with left open the door for the third film.\r\n\r\nNow this became a stylish franchise. That's what happens when a stuntman takes up the directional job for an action flick. He did not write it, but he knew exactly how to create them, technically perfectly. Besides, he got wonderful, dedicated actors to achieve that. Not just Reeves, but all were awesome. Believe the third film would be a kick-ass, particularly the pace that could match with likes 'Crank'. Just watch it already and be prepared for the next, the mega finale.\r\n\r\n_8/10_",

  "content": "Picking almost right where the previous film ended, \"John Wick Chapter 2\" deals with the consequences of Wick's return to the assassin life and how he got out to begin with.\r\n\r\nAs expected, it expands on the mythology hinted at in the first movie, with the revelation that there's a high council of sorts, other Continental hotels around the world, and a very widespread network of assassins.\r\n\r\nAlso as expected, it ups the ante with bigger action sequences, and a much higher body count. We get to know more about some rival assassins played quite brilliantly by Common and Ruby Rose (whose character communicates solely through sign language; in many cases, this kind of thing is used as a gimmick to make the audience remember a character when they have nothing else to distinguish them, but it's not the case here  and is used only as an aspect of the character; smartly done). Keanu Reeves...let's the Reeves of old come through a couple times, with a couple of bizarre and inappropriate inflections. Ian McShane's Winston expands a little bit, although he still refers to John as Jonathan, which is just wrong. If it's supposed to be some kind of an in-joke with them, they don't reveal anything about it. Again, I think there's more going on with Lance Reddick's hotel manager than they're letting on. And I was a little disappointed that Peter Stormare wasn't in more of the film, as he's always fun.\r\n\r\nAgain, the world is very wide, and almost seems like everyone is involved with this underworld. There is an indication that that's not the case here and there, but we never get to meet anyone who doesn't know what's going on, which keeps some of that suspicion up.\r\n\r\nThe plot follows a pretty basic structure. Actually, it follows a pretty rigid structure. In a two hour movie, it can be broken down almost exactly into half-hour sequences, something that struck me as a little odd. There are some minor plot twist. Nothing major or out of the blue, but at least there was an attempt.\r\n\r\nSo now we come down to it. Is it better or worse than the first movie? Well, I would have to say \"yes\". It definitely ups the ante and is a much bigger film than the first movie, expanding on the mythology and the characters. At the same time, it falls into the trap that a lot of these bigger, badder sequels fall into, which is that with the bigger scope, it feels like they have to use a bigger yoke on everything in order to keep in reined in and from going off the rails on its own. In fact, they may have expanded the world too quickly, going from a city in the first movie to the entire globe in the second. That rapid expansion makes that bigger yoke much more percpetible and, while the ambition is admirable, at times I wondered if they may have bitten off more than they could chew.\r\n\r\nStill an enjoyable action film, and if you liked the first film, you'll most likely enjoy this one.",

The assassin underworld is expanded as we get to see more subsects and players in the space. There are complex relationships that Wick has with many characters in this film, and although we never see what occurred in the past, the history is there in terms of their interactions. This is especially apparent in the end when all of Wick’s former “co-workers” start entering into the fold. This had to be my favorite part of the film. Rome, as a setting, was great and the underground tunnels were a fun environment for Wick to play in. The action was brilliant once again, with more weapons and creative kills included. I loved that we got to see Wick use the pencil on two of the guards! There were some beautiful shots with fantastic color due to the city light scape. The use of water reflections was done well, although, I do think there might have been a few too many. The pace towards the end started to slow down. I feel as though this movie should have been maybe 10-15 minutes shorter. Despite that, this movie was once again a fantastic entry into the series and on par with the first in terms of quality, action, and enjoyment. \r\n\r\nScore: 79%\r\nVerdict: Great",

  "content": "<em>'John Wick: Chapter 2'</em> felt a tad different to me, even if I still had exactly the same reaction to it - enjoyment!\r\n\r\nKeanu Reeves fits the lead role extremely well, he certainly elevates the films with his performances. I'd say the supporting cast are an improvement from the original, Riccardo Scamarcio alongside the likes of Laurence Fishburne, Ruby Rose and Common are good to watch. More of Ian McShane is welcomed, too.\r\n\r\nThe difference that I felt was that there seemed to be many more talky moments, the preceding film felt like it had more wall-to-wall action than this. I could be wrong, but I'm not complaining either way - just an observation. I'm interested to see how the third film panned out.",

Alexander Gould, Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres are the obvious stars as the early mentioned trio. There's a load of others though, with Willem Dafoe (Gill), Geoffrey Rush (Nigel) and Barry Humphries (Bruce) all giving excellent performances.\r\n\r\nThe animation is superb, a few moments haven't aged as greatly but the absolute vast majority still looks unbelievable. The premise is funny, cute and heartwarming - as it keeps one's attention from start-to-finish. The score is fantastic, too.\r\n\r\nHighly recommended.",

Living amidst the wonders of the Barrier Reef has began to wear on the young clownfish, though, and he yearns for the open ocean. His dad knows best and has forbidden him from leaving the safety of their home waters but one day his nose gets the better of him as he espies a fishing boat and next thing he is caught by a diver who whisks him off to the surgery of a dentist where he is deposited in a tank with some fellow prisoners - awaiting the arrival of the man's daughter who is to be the new owner of \"Nemo\". Now young as he is, he's not without nouse and is soon working on a plan to return to the open sea - which they can all see from the window! Meantime, pop \"Marlin\" is in a panic and in his search for his wayward son encounters \"Dory\" - a forgetful fish who thinks she's seen a boat, but then again... Loads of colourful and enjoyable escapades follow as the pair use ingenuity and take quite a few risks to become reunited. First things first - \"Dory\" just annoyed me. Right from the start I was hoping that she would become shark fodder. She has short term memory loss - but how does she remember that? Anyway, apart from that there are loads of endearing characters here from the vegetarian sharks, the loveable \"Peach\" and the characterisation of \"Nemo\" imbues him with an innocence and mischievousness that has to raise a smile - and even engender a bit of concern - as he seems destined for transit in the same plastic bags we all used to use for our goldfish back in the day. The animation is gorgeous and the clever soundtrack (there's even a bit of Herrmann's \"Psycho\" in here) adds loads to enrich this classy and charming adventure. It's really a big screen experience, if you can.",

I had heard of <em>'Edward Scissorhands'</em> but actually knew very little about it, typified by the fact I was expecting this to be very dark - probably just based on the seeing the cover here and there. It's much sillier than expected, but in a positive way.\r\n\r\nI do kinda end up wishing they went down a more dark/creative route, instead of relying on the novelty of having scissors as hands; though, to be fair, they do touch on the deeper side a bit. With that said, I did get a good amount of entertainment seeing this plot unfold. It's weird and wonderful.\r\n\r\nJohnny Depp is a great actor and is very good here, mainly via his facial expressions and body language. It's cool to see Winona Ryder involved, someone I've thoroughly enjoyed in more recent times in <em>'Stranger Things'</em>. Alan Arkin and Anthony Michael Hall also appear.\r\n\r\nThe film looks neat, as I've come to expect from Tim Burton. It has the obvious touch of Bo Welch to it, with the neighbourhood looking not too dissimilar to what Welch would create for 2003's <em>'The Cat in the Hat'</em> - which I, truly, enjoyed.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly worth a watch.",

Sadly, the creator dies before he can rectify this and so young \"Edward\" (Johnny Depp) is left alone in his lofty castle. Alone, that is until a kindly Dianne Wiest (\"Peg\") takes him under her wing, introduces him to her many friends - including an on-form Winona Ryder (\"Kim\") - and they all discover he has a remarkable ability for topiary (and hairdressing!). Soon he is all the rage, the talk of the town - but always the misfit, and of course when a mishap - in this case a robbery for which he is framed - occurs, his fickle friends turn on him readily. It's a touching tale of innocence and humanity; Depp plays his role skilfully and with delicacy and humour, and the last half hour is quite a damning indictment of thoughtlessness and selfishness that still resonates today. Like many \"fairy\" tales, it has it's root in decent morals and Tim Burton is ahead of the game in delivering a nuanced and enjoyable modern day parable that makes you laugh, smile and wince with shame in equal measure.",

Our eponymous robot spends it's time packaging up waste into cubes, stacking them, then retreating to it's home of an evening before the storms hit! The planet has been decimated - only his friendly locust survives to keep him company. One fateful day, though, another craft arrives and it's occupant \"EVE\" is soon a-scanning and making friends - after a shaky start - with her more indigenous pal. Things take quite a turn when \"EVE\" discovers what it was sent to find - a life form. In this case a tiny shoot. Alarm bells ring and shortly afterwards a spaceship arrives to collect \"EVE\" and the foliage. Not about to be left behind, the ship soon has a stowaway and we are presented with an explanation of just what happened to humanity - now, basically, a bunch of armchair-bound, boneless globules of flesh - who think they've been on an intergalactic cruise for the last seven hundred years! Can they all get back to Earth and sow the seeds of humanity's redemption? Well not without a little bit of automated interference and some fun escapades that are engaging and touching. The fate of our race is in the hands of these two mechanical creations - but the broader meaning here is clear as a bell. If we continue to treat the planet like it is our own personal garbage dump, then we will reap what we sow! Entertaining and thought-provoking without resorting to simplistic pontification, politicisation or lawlessness. Well worth a watch.",

For a decade, the little kids grew into older teenagers. But for an animation character, there's no concept of ageing. They always remain same. This film just gave a new perspective. I mean it talked about being or growing old and how it impacts our lives. That we can't hold forever our safe position. Sooner or later, the youngsters will take over it.\r\n\r\nMcQueen is enjoying his racing, competing with his friendly opponents. But it all changes when a young rookie rewrites the history.

I like the idea of what they were going for, but the way the do it is actually quite poor - it feels too forced, as well as chucking most of the development for McQueen across acts one and two out the window.\r\n\r\nWith that said, it isn't a massive hindrance. I still had a fun time with this. Owen Wilson remains good as McQueen, while Cristela Alonzo gives an accomplished performance as Ramirez. One thing I do rate about Alonzo is that Disney didn't go down the obvious, lovey-dovey route with her. \r\n\r\nNone of the rest of the cast standout all that much, though it's cool to hear Kerry Washington as Natalie Certain. Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) is arguably underused, which is weird as he is overused in the 2011 sequel - they don't seem to know how to fit him in ideally.\r\n\r\nThe overall premise itself is interesting, while the animation remains in top gear.

  "content": "**The end of a franchise that was never really worth our interest.**\r\n\r\nI never really wanted to see the “Cars” movies. As I said before, I was already an adult when they appeared, and I particularly felt the almost invasive force of the propaganda machine that, by all means, tried to foist the film on us, almost in the same way that Jehovah's Witnesses go to people's homes to sell their perspective of religion. “Cars” was everywhere, and the merchandising involved was a billion-dollar business in itself. Therefore, I preferred not to see them. I don't like to feel that things are being forced on me. I saw this film, the last of the trilogy, right now.\r\n\r\nComparing this film to the first in the franchise could be considered an honest effort. The two films are quite similar, although the first has an ascendant, due to its novelty. As for the script and the story itself, both are complete clichés: if one talks about the success of a novice “outsider”, full of nobility and desire to win, the third film already shows us that everything has an end, and that there is to know how to leave the scene and give way to others in an honorable and dignified way. It is the eternal question of the passage of generations and their conflicts. In the middle of these two films, “Cars 2” is completely out of place, just having a character as the protagonist who only appeared a few minutes in the first film. “Cars 3”, as cliché as it may be, rediscovered some of the merits and values of the first film.\r\n\r\nEven so, and despite the commercial and critical success, I don't think it's honest to compare any film in the “Cars” franchise with the films “Toy Story”, “Up” or “Inside Out”. In these films, Pixar bet on creativity, that is, on the creation of an original story and very original characters. That never happened in \"Cars\". Just think of the huge amount of cartoons that include, albeit in an accessory way, talking cars. It's an old idea, one that Pixar has merely retreaded and brightened up, with CGI animation techniques it masters like few others. Quite simply, it was a way to earn lots of money with little effort.\r\n\r\nIn this film, we once again have the technical brilliance, attention to visual detail and the sharpness and quality of digital animation that Pixar has accustomed us to. It would be too bad for the studio not to be able to honor its credits and fail even at this! In addition to the magnificent animations, the mixing, sound and editing work was really taken very seriously and done by good professionals. The work of the voice actors also deserves no notice, with the return of Owen Wilson and other outstanding voices, joined by Cristela Alonso. All were well, in an impeccable work.\r\n\r\nIf we have already spoken about the script, we can only talk about the comic: the film makes several attempts at humor, and if the jokes seem to be well-placed in the plot, the truth is that they have almost no strength or impact, and simply do not make people laugh. They're not funny. Attempts to thrill or move the audience also failed utterly, largely due to the Franciscan poverty of the characters, merely sketchy and barely able to capture our sympathy.",

  "content": "Hmmm! This outing for the now well past his best \"Lightning McQueen\" reverts back more to the first film, only by now we are all maybe just a bit tired with the formula? The shiny red champion is having to face the reality that technology and engineering have evolved since 2006 and he is simply no longer the best. Of course, he's not going to give up and with the \"Piston Cup\" looming, he determines to recover from what looked like a career ending crash. To that end, he coaxes up-and-coming engineer \"Cruz\" and his own motivator \"Smokey\" - who worked with the legendary \"Hudson Hornet\". He needs discipline, he needs to re-learn all he knew, he needs to listen - if he is to seriously challenge the all-conquering \"Jackson Storm\". There are a few nice touches to this, but essentially it's a rehash with a little too much cheesy sentiment and I found the musical numbers just a bit more intrusive, too. There's also a little more pontificating here. The script exudes loads of virtues but rather more in your face than by using the humour and personalities to illustrate loyalty, affection and dedication. There's still plenty of lively action animation and it doesn't hang about, but for me this franchise has matured now, and needs to get to a motor museum near you.",

  "content": "The second movie in the new Spider-man movie series that directed by Marc Webb. I doubt his potential after seeing this movie. I feel someone should take his position before it become too late. In the history of the Spider-man movies, from all the 6 this one is the worst. Commercially it has done a great business that grabbed around $800 million all over the world, but failed to deliver another quality movie for the fans. The movie engaged with the too much character and subplots. The subplots were not placed in the right spots, kind of random appearance brings the chaos in understanding the story. I had a high hope on this movie and it did not supply well. Frankly, I kind of lost interest in Spider-man. Maybe because it was too soon to reboot, I guess.\r\n\r\n> **‘‘You want to be the hero.\r\n> And now you gotta pay the price.’’**\r\n\r\nThe first movie gave a decent re-start for the refreshed Spider-man movie series. And what happened here in this second installment was a disaster. The first thing is it was nearly a 2 and half an hour movie that brought me lightly a headache to carry on thus far. Actually, it was 10 minutes shorter than what it is now, but in the end they have developed a bit longer to show the opening scene of the third movie. When a movie got a powerful hero, it should have equally matched antagonist. If they are matched, then the fight between them are the next thing to bring the best out of it. I think the Electro man did not click as they have expected, at least not to me. The strength he had was something beyond spider-man, but did not unleash him in a perfect manner. Though Jamie Foxx was not bad in that avatar, the filmmakers kind of wasted his presence for not so good scenes.\r\n\r\nRemember the original Spider-man was the modern superhero movies, I mean it was done using computer graphics. Afterwards 'Batman', 'Iron Man', 'Thor' and all were followed. I like the version with Tobey Maguire in it, though my rating declined by movie after another in the trilogy. This reboot series had a good opening, but failed to get the momentum going. Especially all the emotions were looked fakes that do not appeal like the original movie series did. Yes, it had a wonderful box office and that does not mean the movie is good, either worst. But expected a little better, especially in the negative characters. Andrew Garfield was good, not awesome, because most of his masked parts were CGI. Emma stone was another let down and could not help comparing her with Kristen Dunst, because she was no way near, at all. The Dane DeHaan role had the same issue and I don't know why people did not get better space in the movie that ran 140 minutes long. Like I said subplot spoiled everything I think. The digital 3D and stunts were poor. Yeah, there are many things to complain about it than to praise, but all the answer should come in the next sequel. If that makes bigger, not commercially, I mean with a good story, graphics and performances then there will be no problem. But if it fails, I had to say 'bring back the fourth installment of the original movie series'. Definitely not worth a watch, but anyway most of the guys going to watch it or already watched it.",

  "content": "It seems that Spider Man is doomed to receive mediocre to abysmal implementations on the big screen. Well, at least in my opinion. The Amazing Spider Man 2 currently have a rating of 7.1 which quite surprises me. This was not the worst Spider Man movie. The 2nd instalment, Spider-Man 2, in the first series with Tobey Maquire still holds that title firmly.\r\n\r\nThere are some nice special effect fireworks going on and there are some funny parts when Peter Parker puts on the mask and goes to action but apart from that I found the movie uninspired, with a mediocre plot and sometimes downright boring. The plot is perhaps suitable for a comics magazine with its standard set of unlikely events, backstabbing big-corporate employees and disgruntled scientists becoming super villains but on the big-screen one would expect a wee bit more effort going into the plot.\r\n\r\nThe main villain, Electro, was … well not really giving much of an impression. He never lifted above the pretty silly scientist letting everyone walk all over him and doing really, really stupid things like trying to put two high voltage cables together without turning off the power. Sure he tried to give a menacing appearance towards the end but to me he never really managed to elevate himself to a real super-villain. I almost got the impression that the director actually realized that Electra was not good enough and so decided to come up with some convoluted scheme to throw in The Green Goblin at the end. None of these villains are really bad, just mediocre.\r\n\r\nThen of course there is the obligatory Peter Parker wallowing in self-pity that every director seems to just have to put in these movies. It is not funny and downright boring. And for the ending cliffhanger they throw in the Rhino…as some jerk in a monster mechanical suit :-( . What the f…? The Rhino is supposed to have a polymer bonded to his skin and augmented strength and speed. Not be running around in some silly mechanical Rhino toy!\r\n\r\nThe entertainment factor of this movie comes almost entirely from the SFX action and a few select scenes. Otherwise the movie was fairly (yawn) mediocre as far as I am concerned. Having said that, being the sci-fi and super-hero fan that I am, I will probably buy the next instalment anyway if one comes out.",

  "content": "Spider-Man stuffed once again.\r\n\r\nMarc Webb returns to direct what Sony had hoped was the second instalment of a longer running reboot of the Spider-Man franchise. Writing this now, I'm armed with the knowledge that once again the web slinger will get another reboot in 2017, which after viewing this sequel comes as no surprise.\r\n\r\nIt's not so much that it's a bad film, or a bad Spider-Man film at that, it's just that it feels all very familiar, whilst simultaneously hugging the same pitfalls as Sam Raimi's Spiderman 3. Webb tries to juggle a screenplay with 3 villains (well two and a half really), a tricky romance between Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) and Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), and of course there's school, a best friend and affairs of the home heart to deal with.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of Electro (Jamie Foxx) is a good move, inputting a new villain into the spidey world is most welcome. Yet in spite of Foxx earning some level of sympathy with the characterisation, it never really works and unfortunately draws comparisons with a certain Mr. Freeze from another franchise. Dane DeHaan comes in as Harry Osborn, soon to be Green Goblin, again the tortured soul act is well performed, but come Goblin time the make up and effects work is laughable. While Paul Giamati as Aleksei Sytsevich - cum - Rhino, is having fun but is barely in the picture.\r\n\r\nStone is the best thing in it by far, while Garfield works hard, but there is no getting away from the fact that they both are - and look - too old for their parts. The action is fun and pulse raising, but there's not enough of it to sustain a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes. Though on the plus side Webb and his team are to be applauded for choosing a story line that is ultimately bold and contains a great emotional whack. All told it's a shaky entry to the spidey world, one that once again forced Sony into another rethink. Lets hope the next journey spidey goes on has some clarity and streamlined sense. 6/10",

  "content": "I think maybe some of the lustre from Andrew Garfield's first outing as \"Spider-Man\" had already worn off for this really rather mediocre sequel. This time he has to don his red and blue lycra and save the city - and \"Gwen\" (Emma Stone) - from the marauding \"Green Goblin\". There is quite a degree of on-screen chemistry between Garfield and Stone, and as an action-romance, this is at the more entertaining end of the scale. It's the plot and the tech elements that let it down. The visual effects upon which it relies so heavily are really nothing special. Nor, it has to be said, are the baddies. The \"Green Goblin\" just isn't menacing enough. That might be, perhaps, because Dane DeHaan is one of those actors (a bit like Michael Pitt) whom I never really understood why he made it at all. The make up artists do work wonders in demonstrating his decline into moral turpitude, but as an actor he is just, well, insipid as the poor, misguided and bitter \"Harry Osborne\". Jamie Foxx has a bit more fun as the sparky \"Electro\", though that character is largely undeveloped and Sally Field can be relied upon to add a little maternal instinct as \"Aunt May\", but somehow the whole thing is just one beat off. The first film had a much stronger story and a cast that were still bedding down; this reverses that with much more assured performances from the two at the top of the bill, but with a much less meaty story to back them up. I did like Andrew Garfield in this role - he has charisma as an actor, but this is all just a bit flat and though impressive to watch on a big screen with big sound, is not a film that will make anyone's top ten - even Marc Webb's, I think.",

His pals, though - well they are not so enamoured of the place. After an encounter with the penguins doing their best to tunnel to Antarctica, \"Marty\" the zebra yearns for the wild and decides the best he can do is a train to Connecticut. When his friends discover that he has done a bunk, \"Gloria\" (the hippo), \"Melman\" (the giraffe) and \"Alex\" set off in hot pursuit. They don't get very far but inadvertently they do get their wish - the humans decide that these creatures should be free and so off they are shipped. En route, the pesky penguins realise that Africa is no use to them so they commandeer the ship and divert it to chillier climes. Not before, however, the crates carrying our intrepid travellers topple overboard and end up on the island of Madagascar. There they discover the population of lemurs ruled with a rod of lettuce by \"King Julius\" and terrorised by the local foussa (think very small lions). Of course when we hear the animals speak, we hear words. When the other creatures hear \"Alex\" it is a mighty roar - just what the lemurs need to keep their foes at bay. Will the visitors settle in, or miss their home comforts and want to head back home? Will their more natural instincts start to kick in and start to test the strength of their friendships? Although there is, for me at any rate, just way too much relentless dialogue - especially from the giraffe and the zebra, this is a fun family adventure with loads of action, some enjoyable pith from quite a witty and observational script and, of course, we have the message for all to adhere to about loyalty and friendship etc... The jungle animations are fun and there are not too many songs to clutter up the steady pace of the proceedings. Makes you wonder just how many animals in a zoo would actually want to be repatriated to the wild (assuming they were ever there in the first place!) to fend for themselves!",

He is happy with his lot, shuns commitment and his best form of defence is attack both physically and verbally against those who want to impose their will on him for better or worse.\r\n\r\nAt the same university a professor of mathematics throws out a complex mathematical challenge to his students, asking them to complete the formula on a blackboard in the hall outside of his classroom. Will is cleaning floors one morning, comes across the blackboard and within seconds he has completed the formula before carrying on his duties while the professor wonders who it was!\r\n\r\nIt turns out Will was abused in his youth, and has moved on from one foster family to the next, but none of them were seemingly any better, and never reached out to his needs leaving him feeling bitter and angry.\r\n\r\nA psychology professor (Robin Williams), spends various sessions with Will, and slowly, ever so slowly, Will begins to open up his darker side until both Will and the professor find a bond.\r\n\r\nMake no mistake the premise is original but predictable. However, the acting performances are terrific, especially from Damon, whom I never really had much time for up until this film.\r\n\r\nI was also impressed by the performance of Will's girlfriend, played by Minnie Driver. She soon fell in love with him, only to find that he never reciprocated and pushed her away just as had done to other people who tried to get too close to him in the past.\r\n\r\nIt is very much a feel-good film with a nice satisfying ending. It pulls at the heartstrings sometimes, but you just know everything will work out right in the end.",

  "content": "So great!\r\n\r\n<em>'Good Will Hunting'</em> is a film I had heard many a great thing about but had never actually seen it so didn't know anything about the plot - so much so that I genuinely thought it was about the good will of hunting or something... and certainly not about a character named Will Hunting! The poster makes it look like a film of that sort, in my defence.\r\n\r\nI also didn't realise, aside from the lead two, that the cast list was so stacked until the credits came up at the start. The names didn't let me down either, as the acting is superb across the board. Matt Damon and Robin Williams are truly outstanding together, I already rate them from other productions so I'm glad I can add another cracker to their respective filmographies.\r\n\r\nEven away from Messrs Damon and Williams, you've got very good displays from the likes of Stellan Skarsgård, Minnie Driver (emotionally, particularly, excellent) and Ben Affleck. Pretty impressive that it was written by both Affleck and Damon too!\r\n\r\nThe plot is great, the way the friendship builds between Will (Damon) and Sean (Williams) is so beautifully done. Both characters are very interesting, even if I didn't buy the genius of Will at all at first but I quickly let that go as the film does such a grand job at crafting everything together around it.\r\n\r\nIn short, it's ace! Glad I finally checked it out.",

  "content": "\"Will\" (Matt Damon) is a rudderless character who works as a caretaker. He's an attitudinal pain in the neck whom, aside from his best friend \"Chuckie\" (Ben Affleck), is pretty much shunned by everyone. \"Professor Lambeau\" (Stellan Skarsgård) spots some potential in this wayward lad, especially when he realises that he has an amazing ability to solve mathematical problems. To that end he sends him to see the eccentric psychologist \"Sean\" (Robin Williams) who proves remarkably adept at cutting down the young man's defences and at beginning to rebuild the character of the man in a more positive and life-affirming fashion. The film combines some excellent performances from all four men, but especially a bang on-form Williams as the penetrative, but flawed, route to salvation for an equally flawed and angry almost younger version of himself in the genius \"Will\". Damon is entirely convincing as his temper and his prodigious nature are juggled adeptly and aided by a powerful script that allows the actors to take and keep centre stage as the potency of the plot becomes more and more focussed, we are presented here with a ground-breaking and thought-provoking look at what makes a great teacher as well as what makes a human being tick, what makes one happy and fulfilled - and what makes one the opposite! For my money, Gus Van Sant's finest interpretative work and well worth watching a few times, for more detail emerges to appreciate each time you see it.",

  "content": "**A very good film, but with some flaws and problems that deserve attention.**\r\n\r\nThis film is about a boy from Boston, who comes from very poor backgrounds, but who has a gift for mathematics, easily solving theorems and advanced problems that leave Harvard professors unanswered. He is discovered after solving one, at night and without telling anyone, and one of the professors at the university decides to help him be someone and make use of his gift. The problem is that he doesn't want to, he's not able to trust anyone, and he's seriously stuck with justice. Therefore, he will recruit an irreverent psychiatrist to try to help the boy.\r\n\r\nThe film's premise is very good, and the story has merits that we cannot ignore or minimize. It's one of those delicious movies to watch, that leaves us without feeling the time that passes. We really know that guy is not a bad person, but it's not easy to like the character due to his options and his bad social attitude. However, what bothered me the most was the construction of Robin Williams' character and his whole way of acting and accompanying that patient. I think anyone who has ever had the need to see a psychiatrist knows that they have strict rules about what they can and cannot do, and Williams' character breaks a good number of them.\r\n\r\nAnd this leads us to talk about actors. I really enjoyed Williams' work, but he is a long way from the best that the actor has given us. Matt Damon also did a good job, perhaps one of the best of his career, and one that opened more doors for him in his professional life. Stellan Skarsgard also intelligently took advantage of the opportunity to impose himself on the American cinematic scene, with a job well done and of great merit. Minnie Driver also did an interesting job, perhaps even more so than Ben Affleck, whose character doesn't have as much visibility or relevance.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film has many merits, starting with the excellent cinematography, a good set of sets and interesting costumes. The effects are understated, but they work quite well, and the soundtrack also does a pretty good job. It is not, however, a film that stands out for its technical aspects, nor could it be. The important thing in this film is the story it brings us and the work of the cast.",

  "content": "Psychological drama well in the beginning of Ben Aflleck and Matt Damon in their careers - they star (with Matt in the role of the protagonist) and wrote the script together. The director was Gus Van Sant (Drugstore Cowboy).\r\n\r\nThe movie tells a story about a irish-descendant boy in Boston that works as janitor in a mathematics faculty, and it is a self-taught genius, with a troubled past and present - some  mathematical riddles are left by the head of the chair in the faculty (Skarsgård) and mysteriously solved by night. Catching up with Matt Damon character Will he can be out of parole if he gets a job and consult with a psychiatrist what shows to be a tid bit tough thing. \r\n\r\nThe film received positive reviews from critics and grossed over $225 million during its theatrical run against a $10 million budget, and received nominations in nine categories, including Best Picture and Best Director, and won in two: Best Supporting Actor for Williams and Best Original Screenplay for Affleck and Damon. Nothing bad, at all for someone being just out of Harvard University. Anther curiosity: character Skylar in the movie have the same name and background of Matt Damon's girlfriend back then.\r\n\r\nRobin Williams acts as the psychiatrist that could connect with this troubled boy, in a solid role - speaking of solid role it was nice to see Matt Damon out of some action movie in really nice drama scenes. Another actor that shows up is Stellan Skarsgård, yes the father of the four sons the most known being Bill (of \"It\"). \r\n\r\nNice heartwarming moving movie thought the end with a solid script. I would scorre it a 8.0 out of 10.0 / B+. It is strange that I didn't even reminded this one back in 97, but then I remembered that that year I was in the 3rd year of Medicine so not much time to seeing movies I guess.",

  "content": "The latest film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has arrived with “Shang Chi and The Legend of the Ten Rings”.\r\n\r\nThe film introduces audiences to Shang Chi (Simu Liu); an easygoing San Francisco resident who spends his time parking cars and hanging out with his friend Katy (Awkwafina) and her family.\r\n\r\nLife is steady if unspectacular until he is accosted on a city bus by a group looking to take a pendant his mother gave him. When Shang Chi shocks Katy and the occupants of the bus with his martial arts abilities; he attempts to find his sister Xialing (Meng’er Zhang); who runs an underground fight club. While Xialing is estranged from her brother; their father Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) has conspired to bring them and their pendants before him.\r\n\r\nTheir father uses the power of sacred devices known as the Ten Rings to rule for over a thousand years and destroys all who would oppose him thanks to their power and the army he has gathered over the centuries.\r\n\r\nWenwu wants to revive their long-dead mother as he is convinced that she is calling to him and he wants to be with her as he was able to be a better man and forsake the power and abilities the rings offered him.\r\n\r\nWhen it is learned that Wenwu plans to go to a mythical realm that their mother came from and free her or burn the place to the ground; Shang Chi must make some hard choices between family and doing what he believes is right.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is an action-filled thriller with plenty of mysticism and humor.  The film has a very engaging visual style that combines Asian and Western cinematic styles which results in some very engaging visuals as well as action sequences.\r\n\r\nWhat really sets the film apart from many Super Hero films is that the characters have a solid base to them as they have a complexity to them in regards to their past and their motivations. Their relationships with one another are key to the film as family, honor, and justice are key elements to the film but they are not given lip service but are developed well along with their characters.\r\nWhile the final act may be a bit FX heavy for some; I found it in keeping with the story and the characters and the great Sir Ben Kingsley provides some very welcome comic relief in his return as Trevor.\r\n\r\nAwkwafina is also great as she provides some very laugh-out-loud moments but is not afraid to mix it up when the situation calls for him. Simu Liu was very enjoyable in the lead role as he performed the physical aspects of his character well but added a restrained sensitivity to his character as he is a complicated individual who is conflicted by choices he made in his youth and the ramifications of them now as an adult.\r\n\r\nThere are bonus scenes that set up future adventures well including one that will no doubt have Marvel fans heatedly debating when the film premieres.\r\n\r\nOnce again Marvel has shown why they have had such a sustained success with their films as they have done a great job again of introducing a new character to the Cinematic Universe but also connecting him to their cinematic past and future.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5",

Destin Daniel Cretton delivers an entertainment-heavy movie with arguably the best action ever seen in the cinematic universe. Through the outstanding mix of long takes, impressive fighting choreography, and jaw-dropping stunt work, Simu Liu shines with his martial arts skills, but also in tackling the identity issues of the protagonist. Marvel gains yet another emotionally compelling antagonist, as well as a relatable female character that embodies many elements of the Asian-American culture. Despite an overreliance on unnecessary, excessive exposition devices (narration, flashbacks, foreshadowing), the story behind all the tales and legends never loses interest. From the breaking of stereotypes to a remarkable depiction of their culture, most Asian viewers will certainly love this film, even more than I do. Phase Four is off to a remarkable start…\"\r\n\r\nRating: A-",

As is usual with marvel property this film is a minefield of links to past and future marvel ventures, but is done in such a way that it truly can be an entry point into the extensive universe without having seen the others.\r\n\r\nThe story develops slowly unwrapping the setting but it also serves to highlight the beautiful cinematic choices Destin Daniel Cretton has made, cinematic shots build to a grand climax with a sufficiently marvel-esque battle between relatable family struggles in unrelatable places and circumstances\r\n\r\nThe end to the fight is satisfyingly predictable and leaves a numbness upon the audience because of the climax's grandeur and its fizzle into the marvel trope of comedic endings.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 Pre and post credit scenes who for the marvel enthusiasts add a great deal of pleasure adn completion to the story and set up the shang-chi subfranchise.\r\n\r\nThis film through all of its achievements feels disjointed and only becomes a cinematic feat  at its climax leaving the audience feeeling as if they could have missed the first 50 minutes and still understood the majority of storyline.\r\n\r\nThis is an great feat of film through its inevitable cinematic, it is extremely enjoyable nevertheless.",

  "content": "I have to say that this was a surprisingly good movie. I say surprisingly because Marvel (or DC for that matter) have not exactly excelled in making even decent movies for quite some time. That the woke “critics” on Rotten Tomatoes gave it high ratings was a bit of a red flag as well but not only was the movie rather free from woke ramblings and preaching but it was a very fun and entertaining movie to watch.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts off in a somewhat bizarre way with Shang-Chi and his girlfriend swiping a car from a valet parking and going for a joy ride. It turns out that they are telling their story to a couple of friends and that is pretty much how this movie is told.\r\n\r\nIt begins more or less right away with some nice action and it continues that away with plenty of action sequences intermixed with story telling. The action and martial arts is really good in my opinion. They are in stark contrast to the mediocre rubbish we were treated to in Snake Eyes. The latter which was quite a disappointment.\r\n\r\nThis movie relies heavily on fantasy elements with tie ins to Doctor Strange, especially towards the end. Another movie that I liked a lot by the way. Thus there are of course plenty of special effects and CGI. Most of them good or very good. I really liked the beautiful world of Ta Lo. The combat scenes, especially when the rings are in action are both cool and beautiful.\r\n\r\nThere are quite a lot of comical relief in the movie as well and, for once, it is not to silly, outrageous or plain stupid. It contributes well to the enjoyment factor of the movie. The washed out actor is a bit on the limit but otherwise it works well with the rest of the movie. That guy on the bus starting to film and make commentaries was quite hilarious for instance.\r\n\r\nThe story? Well it is a Marvel special effects movie so one should not expect too much but the story is not bad. It mostly holds together and works well enough to tie all the action together. The acting is pretty much the same thing. One should not expect too much but it is good enough. It was nice to see Michelle Yeoh as Ying Nan though. She was one of the few cool characters in Discovery and she does know how to act.\r\n\r\nOverall I very much enjoyed this movie. It is a simple super hero and fantasy adventure story with lots of action and special effects and with the single purpose of entertaining the audience that doesn’t fall in the trap of trying to “educate” said audience.",

Me being old, I am bitter most times from jealously of lost youth and a firey contempt toward lazy boneheaded braindead youth of today.  But I digress...the review.  \r\n\r\nMy review will be short as are my praises, while my critique shall be terse.  Deal with it.  \r\nThis movie is not bad.  I wouldn't call it a waste of money to see, but on the same turn it's not \"OMG, I have to come see this again with Pauly.\"  \r\n\r\nThe special effects (I'm old. Deal) are pretty good, specially when the hero vists the magical homeland his mother gave up gaurding to be with his father.  The fight scenes, while they make an earnest attempt, are not Jackie Chan or Jet Li smooth but they are done with a compentent hand. (So much for being the first Chinese Superhero)\r\n\r\nThere are only few downsides and those are the inconsistencies only a trained eye might see.  If you follow the action and the movie you can simply dismiss them as \"It's in the script.\"  But if you are like me certain questions born of observation nag at you during and after seeing the movie.  Such as, _\"Is the co-star female sidekick supposed to be his girlfriend or sister?!?\"  \"Why does she walk & sound like an old woman if they are supposed to be the same age???\" \"Why does the woman playing his sister look older than he is, but she's supposed to be a few years younger???\"_  I'm not kidding, the woman (While fit) is very UN-easy on the eyes in the beauty department.  And that's saying something considering how dainty most Chinese women appear.  And my last \"knit-pick\" if you will, is that the studio called the rings, rings.  They are not.  They are bracelets since these are worn on the arms instead of the fingers.  But I believe it was done because it was easier to do the special effects for them. \r\n \r\nThe movie is not bad at all, overall.  Good way to pass the time if you happen to run into it on a channel surf. But like _**Black Panther 1**_, not really considered a must-see.",

  "content": "One thing that the MCU hasn't been spectacular at is branching out into other genres. Most have been scifi/fantasy fare. An attempt at horror with \"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.\" Some more comedic entries like \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" \"Shang Chi\" is their attempt to bring the classic Kung Fu fantasy genre into the fold. And it sort of works. It's not wholly original in the idea, but can be taken more as a tribute to the Kung Fu fantasies of old. There are some changes made to established Marvel lore, but nothing that couldn't be lived with and accepted and really are necessary for the story. The story is good, not great, the performances are mostly good. The effects...are mostly decent, but there are some issues. The constructed sets are good, but the green screens are obviously green screens.\r\n\r\nThe main problem this movie has is that it shines a spotlight on a problem the MCU as whole is developing, which happens in the comics and any long running shared universe: It's getting really bogged down by its lore and interconnectedness. It not good for newcomers to the MCU and will likely only appeal to fans of both classic Kung Fu films and the MCU films.\r\n\r\nIt's good. It's entertaining. It provides some new stuff for the MCU, but it falls short of actually being a great film.",

  "content": "**They're no strangers, yet they've never met.**\r\n\r\nProbably the most anticipated anime since the final film of Mr. Miyazaki. Because people know what these guys are capable of. This is one per cent sci-fi and 99 per cent fantasy. The concept is not new for us. From 'Freaky Friday' to 'The Lake House', even the recent American television film 'The Swap', you will remember a handful of names once you read this film's synopsis. Yet the film was so good, because of how well the theme was utilised.\r\n\r\nWe all know the technical brilliance of '5 Centimeters Per Second' and the beautiful romance from 'The Garden of Words'. This is an excellent mix of those two. If love either of them, or both, then you will love it as well. But if you ask me, my favourite is still 'The Garden of Words' from this director. I liked this film, enjoyed thoroughly, so liking it less than that means not a bad flick. Surely a film to recommend for anime fans, as well as for animation's (western audience).\r\n\r\nThe story of two teenagers, one from the rural Japan mountain region and the other one from Tokyo. The plot revolves around a comet that is to pass by very close to the earth. But before that event, the girl is bored with her life, so she dreams of living in a big city and that too as a boy. One day her wish comes true when she wakes up as she swapped bodies, including most of the memories with a boy from Tokyo.\r\n\r\nFor her, it is to live as she wanted and make use of the opportunity. But for him, it is like a curse, hence becomes rebellious. This thing keeps happening frequently for days and weeks. After some times, realising the phenomena is between two, they make a deal and strict order of Dos and Don'ts while away. All this until the day of comet and everything changes forever. Searching for the truth and the result of it leads to the end of the tale.\r\n\r\n> ❝Treasure the experience. Dreams fade away after you wake up.❞\r\n\r\nUnlike Miyazaki, Makot Shinkai's storytelling is quite for the matured audience. It targets adults more than the children. Particularly for not shying away to include naturally occurring events in such situation as the story develops, despite/even though the film revolves around the teens/kids. As for this flick, the concern is not big, but it depends on the nation and its culture you belong to. It is very much acceptable and as the story progress, the best things keep replacing another till the finale. So hooked to it is assured.\r\n\r\nThe film length was good and so the pace of the narration. Well written screenplay, which was based on the book of the same name. But the director admits the inspiration from the previous flicks with similar themes. They have used the real places of the anime version with fictional names, but most of the Tokyo remains same and they all were awesome.\r\n\r\nIn many scenes, the camera panning was a treat. Especially the framerate was high, so no jerks, hence very pleasurable visual experience. Like I mentioned earlier, this is a unique film, despite not a original idea. The film proved the Japan is not overshadowed by Hollywood, particularly after the decline of animes in the recent years. It's up to the quality of the product, if so, then those glory days can be brought back for animes. Anyway, now this film holds the record for highest grossed anime.\r\n\r\nApart from technical dominance, the story is also enchanting. If you like romance theme, this will serve you well. A good film for date night. But usually people would skip animation for such occasion and one should not mix up that with anime. Because why I always put apart the anime and animation is, the animes are good at beautiful romance, while its counterpart from the west focus more on comedy and adventure. But the common thing from them is the well explored fantasy theme.\r\n\r\nUsually the ends are guessable for a film like this and the same case for this in here. Only as a result of the story, you would know what's coming, but not the frame by frame scenes of it. Yeah, I liked this conclusion, the final lines said might bring you tears in your eyes, romantically, if you are an emotional person. One of the best endings, even though it was clichéd. And the credits start to roll up, while you begin to recall everything you just saw in the last 100 minutes. A must see film, so highly recommended by my side. Now I've to wait for another couple of years for such film.\r\n\r\n_8/10_",

The amount of detail, particularly in Tokyo, is insane. It's utterly gorgeous to watch.\r\n\r\nThen you have the magnificent story, which is filled to the brim with feeling and meaning.

Of course I don't understand Japanese and was using subtitles, yet I still felt every intended emotion from those two. Class from them. Of the others, Ms. Okudera (Masami Nagasawa) is the one that sticks out most to me.\r\n\r\nIf all that wasn't enough, you even have a tremendous soundtrack and score to boot. It really does all make for a fantastic viewing experience, one I will be revisiting no doubt and one I would undoubtedly recommend.",

  "content": "Your Name is a film that captivates its audience from beginning to end with its superb and incredibly unique storyline. The body swap genre is one that has been explored in various films, but the way it was intertwined with a love story in Your Name is brilliant. What sets this film apart is its refusal to hold the audience's hand. The first act is dedicated to determining what exactly is going on, and this ambiguity only serves to make the movie better. The final act is incredible, with high stakes and quiet moments that help the audience process the intense emotion the characters are experiencing. There is so much to like here, and I truly think it is one of the best animated screenplays ever created.\r\n\r\nThe performances in \"Your Name\" are also noteworthy. Watching the dubbed version, I felt that everyone did a fantastic job. The chemistry between the characters was superb, and nothing was overly acted, which is a problem in some anime. The voice actors managed to convey the emotions of the characters without overdoing it, making the performances feel natural and believable.\r\n\r\nThe direction in Your Name is nothing short of amazing. There were so many unique scenes that can only be done in animation, and each one was painstakingly crafted in such a way that portrays the larger narrative. The animation itself was breathtaking, with fantastic landscapes and 3D integration. It is the best animated visuals I think I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Your Name is a masterpiece that deserves all the praise it has received. Its unique storyline, great performances, and stunning visuals make it a must-watch for anyone who loves animation. The film's direction is impeccable, and the attention to detail is outstanding. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to experience a heartfelt, emotional journey that they will never forget.\r\n\r\nScore: 98%\r\nVerdict: Masterpiece",

  "content": "**Changing one's fixed mind is not an easy task.**\r\n\r\nBased on the novel of the same name, directed by a new lady filmmaker. This British film has two young sensation Sam Claflin and Emilia Clarke in the important roles. The story of a young man who was paralysed recently meets his new caretaker. Initially they both won't fit for each other, but after some time everything changes when they together do some outdoor activities. While the film progress, it only gets more emotional. Besides, it's fun watching the first two acts, particularly the performances from both the lead strikes strongly.\r\n\r\nAfter a very long time I watched a good tearjerker, but not that strong. It is a simple story, there's no big adventure or romance in it. That's right, it is not a romance film and if you decide to watch expecting one, you will be definitely disappointed. Also slightly it delivers a bad message like the negativity for being one seriously ill and alive. This issue is only on the humanity ground, but afterall everyone entitled to do what they want, because it's their life.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the film avoids the usual cliché. Like there's no scene that you had seen in other similar theme repeats here. Deliberately avoided to make it a fresh piece. Basically, if you observe closely the both two lead characters, they had a different agenda about their life. Particularly the caretaker never ever tried anything seriously to accomplish her undertaking.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, those parts were very realistic, but still gives us a cinematic experience due to the fancy screen presentation. Surely a good watch, I think everyone should watch it, because there's no drugs, sexes or nudes or even the strong kissing scenes. Only the main theme is something disturbing, particularly for the tender-hearted people. Other than that, I hope you watch it if you haven't yet.\r\n\r\n_7/10_",

Oh my goodness.\r\n\r\nIt's nice to see Nathalie Emmanuel outside of the Furiously Fast series and it's nice seeing Omar Sy and Sam Worthington again but this movie just steadily gets more campy and more cringe and more stupid as it progresses. The best scene is probably the club hit early on, and it gives you a false sense that the movie is going to be better than the poster - it isn't. In that respect, The Killer (2024) reminds me of Smile (2022). Folks went crazy for Smile. Smile went downhill after the opening scene and never recovered.\r\n\r\nI watched Silent Night (2023). It wasn't horrible, but maybe John Woo should've stopped with that.\r\n\r\nI don't care that the story isn't original, I care that the script is poorly written and the direction is lackluster. Zee is poorly written, Sey is poorly written, Jenn is poorly written, and Finn says \"Kushala Daora\" one-two many times. Jax is probably the best written character and he's on-screen for like 5 minutes total.\r\n\r\nI got the impression early on that they were going for a Killing Eve (2018-2022) vibe, but yeah, no. It's just sad.\r\n\r\nCan someone competent take this cast, this concept - this \"Queen of the Dead\" idea, and do it properly?\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for some female-led assassin action, check out  The Protégé (2021) which wasn't a masterpiece but it was more entertaining than this, Anna (2019), Salt (2010), Red Sparrow (2018), or Atomic Blonde (2017).",

The Killer starts off with a main character, an assassin no less, who comes across as being about as tough and intimidating, as a bowl of warm mashed potato. But hey, she has a punch bag in her bohemian bedsit. Not to mention a handler who looks like he can, in fact, handle himself. \r\n\r\nIndeed, the underlying strategy seems to be to use visually gritty characters and cues, to drown out the entirely non-threatening nature of the lead character. Its a bit like sitting a potted rose down with pots of cacti, in the hope people will inexplicably mistake one, for the other. \r\n\r\nAs you might expect, the results another absurdly unconvincing, predominantly exposition driven, affair, that would, I feel have only worked if re-imagined as a satirical comedy.\r\n\r\nThat's not to say this is the fault of the actors. Its a decent cast, who have found themselves mis-cast, no doubt, I'm guessing, so the script can play gender politics. Suffice to say, the quality acting, is one of the limited upsides, of this flick.\r\n\r\nIn summary, no amount of suspension of disbelief, will make this work.I personally wonder why they persist, when everything I see, seems to suggest the viewing public have thoroughly rejected, the DEI agenda, in favour of  a return to traditional, sensible, entertainment.",

  "content": "You are making big profits from my work, my risk, my sweat. \r\n\r\nThief is written and directed by Michael Mann, who adapts the screenplay form the novel \"The Home Invaders\" written by Frank Hohimer. It stars James Caan, Tuesday Weld, Robert Prosky, James Belushi and Willie Nelson. Music is by Tangerine Dream and cinematography by Donald Thorin. \r\n\r\nFrank (Caan) is a tough ex-con and expert jewel thief. He's working his way out to a normal life, but after being lured to a big job for the mob, he finds plans on both sides severely altered. \r\n\r\nFor his first full length theatrical feature, Michael Mann announced himself to the film world with some distinction, and in the process showed everyone what style of film making makes him tick. Thief is a film of stylised grit, visually, thematically and narratively. Set and filmed in Chicago, Mann, aided by Thorin, shoots the story through pure neo-noir filters. \r\n\r\nAt nighttime it is all a beautifully neon drenched haze, where the streets shimmer with dampness, a dampness brought about by the rain and god knows what else! By day there's a sweaty hue, a feeling that the heat is well and truly on, that even in daylight Frank isn't safe, his dreams may be a touch too far to reach. And no matter what the scene or scenario, Tangerine Dream are laying over the top a throbbing pulse beat, it's like The Warriors trying to get back to Coney Island, the music has a sense of dread about it, that danger is at every corner. \r\n\r\nThis part of Chicago stinks, it's a vile and corrupt place. Dirty cops everywhere, underworld criminals ruling the roost - Hell! You can even buy a baby if you want one. Is it any wonder that Frank just wants to settle down with a wife and child, to walk barefooted in the sea, to have domesticity? But Frank, as smart, tough and savvy as he is, seems to thrive on the edge of things, with Mann giving him earthy and honest dialogue to engage us with, marking him out as an identifiable everyman protagonist who just happens to be an exceptional thief. \r\n\r\nMann's attention to detail is on show straight away, none more so than with the two key safe cracking jobs that are undertaken. Using genuine jewel thieves as technical advisers on the film, these sequences ooze realism, from the tools used, the pre-planning and the execution of the takes, it smacks of reality and does justice to the genuine feel of the characterisations brought alive by the superb cast. And finally Mann delivers a finale of ambiguity, a noir shaded piece of abruptness, an ending that perfectly fits the whole production. 9/10",

OldBoy here, second installment from The Vengeance Trilogy directed by  Park Chan-wook (Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, OldBoy, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance) really have them all, good story, powerful acting and the most horrifying and clever end twist if not genius. In fact no matter how many times you see this, the twist would still be awesome. The theme of revenge here is taken to the next level, to its supremacy for it’s really carefully-planned. OldBoy has a mind-bending assortment of drama, thriller, romance and beautifully spiced up with sadistic plot, shocking elements, ultra violence and clever psychological twist. Imagine yourself captured, locked in a room for 15 years, not knowing why and who did it and when you finally escaped and thought it’s all over, you were wrong and here’s the punching line, the direct punch to your stomach. Min-sik Choi as Oh Dae su really acted well, he really got us carried away by dragging us into the mystery that surrounds his life, into the depression he’s been feeling and into the deep well of his curiosity. Once again, OldBoy is a way too remarkable, when “revenge” isn’t merely knife-chopping or gun-battling. Enough said.",

  "content": "Just about everyone I’d spoken to about this film recommended it to me.\r\n\r\nI watched this film with the original Korean-language soundtrack, with English subtitles.\r\n\r\nOh Dae-su (Chi Min-sik) is a bit of a flirt (whether he is a womaniser is not made clear) with a wife and young child, who has turned two years old on the day we start the film. Dae-su is in a prison waiting room having insulted a woman he was flirting with. A friend comes and eventually gets him out, but while he’s making a call to his wife to explain he will be home soon, he is kidnapped.\r\n\r\nIncarcerated in a small room, with only a TV for company, he is fed and looked after, but not allowed his freedom. He unsuccessfully attempts suicide several times. He keeps himself fit by doing exercise programmes he sees on TV and he starts to dig his way out with chopsticks. He sees a TV report that shows he’s been framed for the murder of his wife. Fifteen years later, without a word of explanation, he is released.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the film follows his attempts to find out why he was imprisoned, who did it, and where his daughter is.\r\n\r\nThe film is frenetic, highly charged, and very emotional on several levels. It is also bloody in places, but Dae-su’s obsession for seeking revenge on whomsoever imprisoned him and on finding out where his daughter is drives this film along. There are psychological aspects to the film as well, and the film does eventually resolve itself – it is not one of those open-ended “I wonder who did it” type films. Follow the film through and you will get all the answers.\r\n\r\nI would recommend it, but I wouldn’t call it light entertainment.",

  "content": "Once upon a time, during a long ago (but certainly not forgotten) era, a horror film's radio trailer would feature the chilling voice-over of a male commentator, whom, after presenting a teaser synopsis for the slasher film's plot (over intimations of both sound and speech from the movie of course), would conclude the radio spot with the following words: 'Coming soon to a theater near you.' And, 'Rated R. Under 17 not admitted without a parent.'\r\n\r\n(Laughs) ...\r\n\r\nThose classic horror film radio trailers used to scare the weebie-jeebies out of me! But boy, did I love them wholeheartedly.\r\n\r\n(Pondering ... in remembrance)\r\n\r\nWhere John Carpenter's independent cult opus \"Halloween\" is concerned, the radio trailer had been no less terrifying. In fact, it made my blood run ice cold. . .\r\n\r\nThough Halloween, one of my most beloved horror films in cinematic history, debuted (theatrically) in 1978, it would not be until October of 1980 that my family and I would spend our \"Movie Date Night\" at what had been a gorgeous movie theater in Gurnee, IL., buying hot dogs, Raisinettes, popcorn, and drinks from its state-of-the-art concession areas, and bracing ourselves for the terror which we were about to watch on one of the theater's humongous screens. Even from that time, I had cover and poster love: Book covers, album covers, and yes, movie posters. It was the artwork. Cover and poster art has always fascinated me. And upon seeing the poster art for Halloween, I fell smitten. For it had been one of the most unique movie posters that I'd ever seen at that time ... And I never forgot it. The artwork, featuring a man's hand wrapped around the handle of a butcher's knife, its pointed tip shown to be in alignment with the face of a Jack O' Lantern, was some of the most creative - not to mention original - movie poster art that my eyes had ever beheld at that time. To this day, it STILL reverberates. I can remember my reaction to it so well, what just standing in that beautiful lobby and staring at the poster for Halloween as it hung in its frame on the movie house wall. Too good. Too good.\r\n\r\n'The Night He Came Home!' ...\r\n\r\nIf there is one horror film antagonist who has left a permanent emboss of the word \"terror\" on my psyche, it's Michael Myers. From the moment Halloween opened on the screen, fear came along to take up its abode within my entire being. The score, titled \"Halloween Theme\", which is also the (Main Title), was so eerily distinctive that the entire theater audience fell into silence - every patron hanging on to every piercing chord of it ... Perhaps me, especially, considering my own gift of music. The incredible John Carpenter not only directed and co-wrote (with Debra Hill) the screenplay for Halloween, but he also composed the entire soundtrack. . .himself. Carp is a badass for sure!\r\n\r\nMoving on. . .\r\n\r\nSet in the fictive town of Haddonfield, IL., this legendary cult film opens to a crowd of children out trick-or-treating on Halloween night. And these candy revelers include a six-year-old boy named Michael, whose choice of costume is a clown suit with a mask. All is well; a seemingly fun-filled All Hollows' Eve night ... Until Michael returns home from his evening of candy collecting, walks, almost mechanically, into his family's kitchen, selects a butcher's knife from the cutlery set, waits until his older sister's boyfriend (who's just finished having sexual relations with her) leaves, then walks, mechanically, upstairs to that same sister's bedroom - catching her unawares. When she turns around (still naked after her sexual escapade) to address him as her younger brother, Michael begins to take his turn penetrating her. . .with the sharp point of the knife. And he doesn't stop his blade puncturing until his sister collapses. He then walks back downstairs and goes out in the front yard to wait. Their parents soon return home to find Michael just standing outside - his face still covered by his mask - with the bloodied knife in his young hand. One of his parents lifts the mask, and we get our first glimpse at the six-year-old face of Michael Myers. The year was 1963.\r\n\r\nThat was just the opening.\r\n\r\nIt would be fifteen years later (in 1978) before the now 21-year-old Michael, escaped from the Smith's Grove Sanitarium, could return to Haddonfield for the purpose of laying claim on his former childhood home: Sitting unsold since the time he murdered his sister, ended up at Smith's Grove as the result of it, and succumbed to the abandonment of his parents. When Michael Myers returned to Haddonfield, all Hell broke loose ... Literally.\r\n\r\nA phenomenally directed cinematic ouvre, Halloween stars Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode, the teenaged protagonist who becomes the hunted of Michael Myers; Donald Pleasence, who portrays Michael's psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Loomis; Brian Andrews, who was cast to play Tommy Doyle; and Nancy Loomis as Annie Brackett, one of Laurie's two best friends, respectively.\r\n\r\nShot on a $325,000.00 budget, Halloween would go on to earn over $71 million worldwide ... For a reason.\r\n\r\nA true cult legend is this Carpenter masterpiece. It is sheer filmmaking ingenuity, a landmark of cinema, and more than worthy of each one of its five stars.",

But I think people give it a reputation in terms of quality that it doesn't fully deserve. The opening ten minutes, and the closing ten minutes, are both **brilliant**. But everything in between? It's kind of... Somehow, both boring and annoying. The kills are good if that's your sort of thing, but everything in the meat of _Halloween_ is old hat. Now of course it wasn't at the time, but when I've spent my formative years watching other movies doing it better (and acting it better), it doesn't really matter who did it first.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it.

  "content": "_**The Boogeyman cometh**_\r\n\r\nA soulless killer, Michael Myers, escapes from the asylum and returns to the Illinois town where he murdered his sister 15 years earlier to wreak havoc on Halloween night. Donald Pleasence is on hand as Myers’ seriously concerned doctor.\r\n\r\nJohn Carpenter’s “Halloween” (1978) is hailed as the progenitor and blueprint for the slasher craze of the 80s with staples like the unstoppable masked killer, fake scares, the final girl and the undead dead. Of course, “Halloween” was influenced by earlier slashers or quasi-slashers, like “Psycho” (1960), “Dementia 13” (1963), “A Bay of Blood” (1971) “Torso (1973), “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” (1974) and “Black Christmas” (1974). “Friday the 13th” (1980) and its sequels took the “Halloween” template and added other elements, like the summer camp setting and a devolving supernatural killer.\r\n\r\nWhilst I prefer the “Friday” films, “Halloween” has more class than many slashers that followed, like the unimaginatively blunt “The Slumber Party Massacre” (1982). It also keeps the proceedings deadly serious unlike ones that added humor and campiness, such as “Friday the 13th Part 3” (1982). The film establishes some quality atmosphere with the raining sanitarium escape and the Halloween night sequences. The creepy ambiance is helped by the moody score composed and performed by Carpenter.\r\n\r\nAlthough the story takes place in a fictional Illinois town, the film was shot in the Los Angeles area (South Pasadena and Hollywood, etc.), which is okay since the neighborhood scenes could be Anytown, USA. What’s NOT okay is how the trees clearly reveal that it’s not late October.\r\n\r\nOther problems include a tedious lack of drive and some weak dialogue, like the girls’ conversation walking home from school, which doesn’t ring true. Speaking of the girls, they’re decent, but not nearly as good as the “Friday” films. Nancy Kyes (Loomis) is arguably the best as Annie, followed by Jamie Lee Curtis as the main protagonist (whose mother, Janet, starred in “Psycho”). Flighty, but likable PJ Soles is also on hand. Another dubious part is the doctor hiding in the bushes by the abandoned Myers’ abode speaking portentously.\r\n\r\nI appreciate “Halloween” because it’s classy, atmospheric and it’s a flick pick for the fall season; it also holds an eminent place in horror history. But, in light of the above flaws, it’s a tad overrated by gushing fans.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-",

The pace and tension build really well - helped by some good use of sound and light (I didn't much care for the over-synthesised score), the supporting screams from PJ Soles and Nancy Kyes and the occasional intervention from Pleasence. The sequels never reached the heights of this, original psychological horror - there are precious few special effect to laugh at or even speak of, really - and if you get a chance to catch up with it as intended on 35mm then you should certainly give it a go.",

  "content": "**A competent film, with a killer who doesn't seem that ferocious when we read what's in the daily newspapers.**\r\n\r\nWell, before writing a review of this film I have to make a declaration of interest that I think is appropriate: I absolutely hate Halloween, it's one of the days of the year that I can't stand. It's not a festival that belongs to my culture, it's completely foreign to the Portuguese tradition, and a poor excuse for stray teenagers to go to strangers' houses, at inappropriate hours, to bother those who are calmly in their own business. I've already had to expel a group with some rudeness and I have no doubt that, one day, I'll still have problems because of this stupidity. Furthermore, for Catholics, the feast day is the following day, November 1st, when the Church celebrates All Saints.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it's a good time to watch horror films on TV, and yesterday I happened to watch the film that brings me here today. Directed by John Carpenter, a director who became an icon of classic horror cinema, the low-budget film became a success, raised a real fortune and, over time, became a slasher classic, a type of horror that I confess I don't particularly appreciate.\r\n\r\nCarpenter directs with his renowned skill and does an excellent job of creating and shaping suspense and atmospheric tension. The director made judicious use of lighting and cinematography, and the visual and sound effects have a truly intelligent and pragmatic effect. The sets are convincing, as are the costumes, and the soundtrack is atmospheric and iconic. Even those who have never seen the film will easily recognize the soundtrack associated with it. Unfortunately, I don't think the film works that well in terms of pacing: the first half isn't strictly interesting, there are many scenes that don't seem to be of much interest to me and that only serve to stretch the overall length of the film.\r\n\r\nAlthough Michael is the indestructible villain and the central character of the entire plot, it is not a challenging role that deserves an accredited actor. Hiding behind a mask, he is a villain who doesn't need good actors, he just needs to seem unbeatable. Jamie Lee Curtis thus ends up being the main actress in the cast, making young Laurie a minimally credible teenager who doesn't just scream and run away hysterically whenever she can, even though she does so often. Donald Pleasance was less lucky: the actor is competent, but the character is a hysterical doctor who seems to believe that his escaped patient is a kind of Antichrist. The histrionic reaction is not received seriously by the authorities, and rightly so, but the actor is good enough to make the character somewhat solid.\r\n\r\nThe big problem with this film is the script: Michael tried to kill his sister in a very cold way when he was six years old. He was unsuccessful, but he was still locked up in a mental institution for a decade, and the doctor began to consider him Evil incarnate? Let's face it, this doesn't convince anyone. Just a few days ago, we saw a man who killed eighteen people in Maine and committed suicide. If he were alive right now, wouldn't he be more fearsome than Michael Myers? The Vampire of Düsseldorf, Peter Kürten carried out sixty-eight crimes and raped, mutilated and killed more than a dozen teenage girls, with extreme cruelty. Wouldn’t it be much more credible as “Evil”? Honestly, the story of this film falls far short of what we see in the newspapers.",

So the movie starts in a way we see he is trying to get into the big leagues that’s when he causes a death by accident then after that follows the whole events with accordance to that incident. Am not going to explain more as it will ruin the movie don’t want to be a movie spoiler.

The story has not been repeated of course the ending is predictable but each scene keeps us at the edge of our seats I have enjoyed all the installments till now and the heroine was also really good with her acting skills .So it’s good for a one time watch. Rated R for brutal violence and language throughout. The movie is directed by Todor Chapkanov. The writers were Boaz Davidson and David N. White.

I had no time to have a quick glance on those before trying this, but while watching this, all the memories came back. It was different. Different means, they wanted the franchise back in action, so they have started with a simple storyline. Everything was predictable in the film, but that was not the point. They a wanted platform, so to move to the better side in the future.\r\n\r\nYuri Boyka was looking forward to take park in a big league, but his last fight did not go well. He won it by a knockout, though the opponent did not survive. That mentally disturbed him, so he wanted to make a few things right. Now, on the eve of the big event, he set to a quick trip to Russia. Why he went and what had happened there, all are the other side of the tale with some good fights and emotions.\r\n\r\nScott Adkins was great. This part kind of reminded me the 'Rocky'. Particularly for the sentimental reasons. The mix of that and stunts were good. Familiarity was the weakness of the film, even though enjoyable. Especially it is for Boyka and 'Undisputed' series fans. They surely would love it. It was a wonderful re-initiation, but hoping better sequels to follow and in a grand scale as well.

A soldier from the future is sent to the 80's to save the leader of the resistance (John Connor) mother from a High Tech Cybernetic Killing Machine. We all know that. What I loved was that this soldier, Kyle Reese volunteers for this suicide mission. He volunteers for one reason because, he had fallen in love with this woman, Sarah Connor. Though they were separated by several decades of time and Judgement Day, her son tells him these tales of his mother Sarah and gives him a single picture of her, purposefully pushing Reese to fall for his mother and this is the reason for him traveling through time to do the nearly impossible. Save and protect Sarah Connor to save the human race in the future and kill a super bad ass T-800 with low tech weaponry and a reluctant Damsel.\r\n\r\nBullets flying and bombs booming make this movie highly entertaining. The storyline, ridiculous as it is, is fantastic and had everyone in the 80's and 90's quoting this SciFi film. It's always a good watch. It holds up nicely overtime.",

  "content": "**James Cameron’s first film immediately showcases his unparalleled mastery of sci-fi action films and world building making The Terminator the gold standard of sci-fi thrillers.**\r\n\r\nThe Terminator franchise has its ups and downs, but it’s hard to deny its iconic status and significant impact on pop culture. Many would pick Terminator 2 as the pinnacle of the franchise, but for me, it’s the first one. While T2 made considerable upgrades to the original in every way, The Terminator was the directorial debut of James Cameron and in his first time in the director’s chair, made a groundbreaking sci-fi masterpiece that has spawned five sequels, a tv show, video games, merchandise and so much more. The story and world established by this film are so rich and vast and a real credit to Cameron’s writing ability. However, my favorite part and the reason The Terminator holds its place as the best in the franchise for me is the character of Kyle Reese. A war-hardened marine for the future who has suffered and fought to survive his entire life travels to the past or protect Sarah Conner, the mother to the savior of humanity in the coming war. Michael Biehn’s performance is tough and heroic but carries the terror and suffering of all the years resisting the machines. He was my hero as a kid and every the namesake for my son! As important as John and Sarah Conner are to the Terminator story, Kyle Reese is its heart. The first film has dated effects (although incredible for its day) and a lower budget than its sequels, but the horror tones and fascinating characters will always make it one of my favorite films.",

Firstly, to get some clothes then to eliminate all the \"Sarah Connor\" folks listed in the phone book. Moments later \"Kyle\" (Michael Biehn) arrives with the aim of thwarting this dastardly plan - and soon the race is on. Meanwhile, \"Sarah\" (Linda Hamilton) is blissfully unaware that she is a target until the news bulletins start reporting the brutal slaying of her namesakes. She is spooked, and takes refuge in a night club while the city's finest head to her rescue. Thing is, Arnie is not just a big muscly bloke, he's a big muscly killing machine - and a nigh-on immortal one at that. \"Kyle\" and \"Sarah\" now have their work cut out just to stay alive while they try to concoct a plan that will destroy her nemesis before it destroys them - and pretty much everyone else it comes into contact with! Aside from the synthesiser music - which has dated quite badly - this film still holds up as a solid and entertaining sci-fi horror film. True, the script is never top of James Cameron's priorities, and here is no different, but the pace of the film and the sparing but effective use of the special effects build to quite an exciting crush-endo that is good to watch with a surprising degree of jeopardy right until the very end. Hamilton is not a very good actress, but as the momentum builds she gels well with Biehn making the whole thing well a worth a watch on a big screen even now, almost forty years on.",

Fairly quickly her investigations take her to a girl's school where a previous tragedy has left a room completely sealed off and that's where she senses the source of this evil may be lurking. Can she figure out who this demon is and thwart it's ambitions - ambitions that really centre on the absorption of her own, true, spirit? Well, what do you think? We have a bit of eye candy from Jonas Bloquet's handyman \"Maurice\" but that's countered by far too many children - so often the death knell in horror films with their screeching, squealing and toxic effect on the jeopardy of any story - if only they would actually just do as they were told! To be fair, though, they are not the only thing that drags this down. It's all so very verbal, procedural and predictable. Even the visual effects are a direct descendent of the first film with a denouement that cannot be a shock to anyone. I know it's hard to reinvent the wheel in this genre, but films like this really offer very little by way of creative innovation, acting/writing skills or even providing the merest hint of scariness.

  "content": "Timeless classic still entertaining the masses as each new generation comes in.\r\n\r\nDorothy is a young girl living on a Kansas farm, during a tornado, she, along with her dog Toto, is swept up and plonked down in a magical and mysterious land known as Oz. Desperate to get back home and under threat from a wicked witch, she is advised to seek out a great wizard who should be able to help her get back home. As she sets off and on her way, she meets and befriends a wonderful array of characters whom also have something to ask of the fabled wizard. It's a journey that will prove to be both magical and fraught with danger.\r\n\r\nThe Wizard Of Oz is a film that has been pored over and dissected from almost everyone involved in the wonderful world of film. One thing that strikes me every time I view it is that there not only is no place like home, there is also no film like The Wizard Of Oz, and really, when all is said and done, there is unlikely to be another film of its ilk to ever grace the silver screen. Upon multiple viewings only the most biased of film fan could say that it is a technically perfect picture, it clearly isn't, for at times it's a wee bit creaky and when scrutinised, some of the performances in the piece are far from being of an excellent standard. Crucially, though, any misgivings are quickly erased due to the utter wonder of it all, you see this is because the film has a beguiling ability to transport everybody who is watching it and slot them into OZ alongside Dorothy.\r\n\r\nThe Wizard Of Oz appeals (and caters) to every demographic and pretty much any age group, we have adventure, the meeting of new friends, fears and trepidations, booming colour, songs to singalong with, and of course the total crux point of homely values. The Wizard Of Oz stands up well 80 years later because it taps into all the emotions available to the human being. Be it a young child spellbound on a first viewing, or an octogenarian couple of grandparents wistfully humming along to the tunes, it's a film that shouldn't be dissected looking for faults and hidden meanings, it's a film that should be loved and praised for the ode to fantastical whimsy that it so obviously is.\r\n\r\nThe film of course will forever be associated with its darling star, Judy Garland. Viewing now, and knowing what a sad life she would eventually lead, The Wizard Of Oz is a fitting picture on which to remember what a magical and wonderful performer she was. Myself as a lump of waning middle aged machismo, has no shame in saying that as Judy sings Somewhere Over The Rainbow I melt and feel as though I'm being sent spinning into another world, that's the power of the piece, because as a sepia Kansas becomes the glorious colour of Oz, nothing else in my world matters, I'm in hook line and sinker.\r\n\r\nThere are many interesting back stories to the picture, with books galore available to anyone interested. Some notes that might interest you being the original castings to be W.C. Fields, Shirley Temple and Deanna Durbin, munchkins running riot, drunken cast members, sadness and suicides, and grizzled old pros fighting hard not to let Garland steal the picture. Well it makes for a great read, for sure, but what remains to this day is one of the most beloved pictures to have ever been made, for once in the pantheon of great cinema we have a film that is termed a classic, that actually deserves to have that tag!\r\n\r\nOne of the great things about the advent of technology is that it can benefit old classic movies to make them better, for now we can view remastered editions of The Wizard Of Oz and appreciate even more what a great job the makers did. Keep your eyes on Dorothy's Ruby Slippers during the film and see how they are the sparkling important character that they should be, or take in the brilliant work of the make up crew, the tiniest of rivets on The Tin Man a testament to the brilliant work that goes into bringing magic to our lives. Get the newest copy you can and then also see it on the biggest screen available to you because The Wizard Of Oz is a 10/10 movie. And then some.",

  "content": "'Oh, Auntie Em, there's no place like home!'\r\n— Dorothy Gale\r\n\r\nThere were two beloved and highly fabled films that my immediate family and I—while in the comforts of our home—never missed during the Easter holiday weekend of each year: The Ten Commandments (ABC), and The Wizard of Oz (CBS) - an unsurpassed duo of the most tremendously blessed movies in motion picture history.\r\n\r\nMany a generational - both past and present - has already seen this musical masterpiece, whether in its original film format, or in its stage adaptation. And without a doubt, it will continue to amaze future generations. Iconic and mesmerizing, The Wizard of Oz (produced during the Great Depression era) is a classic on so many great levels: Screenplay; cinematography; set design; costumes; beautiful Technicolor; the award-winning songs of Herbert Stothart (score), and Harold Arlen & E.Y. Harburg (lyrics: the pair wrote \"Over the Rainbow\"); cutting edge special effects ... And superior performances. Yet another cinematic honoree in the Library of Congress National Film Registry, Langley, Ryerson, and Woolf's The Wizard of Oz is set in stone as one of the greatest efforts in motion picture storytelling to ever be released for general viewing ... Not to mention one of the most mimicked.\r\n\r\nThe cast includes: Judy Garland as our beloved and resilient protagonist Dorothy; Frank Morgan, starring in a quintet of roles: The Wizard, Professor Marvel, the Doorman, the Cabbie, and the Guard; Bert Lahr, in his memorable roles as both Zeke and the Cowardly Lion; Jack Haley as both Hickory and the Tin Man; Ray Bolger as both Hunk and the Scarecrow ... And let us not forget the legendary Margaret Hamilton, as both Miss Gulch and The Wicked Witch of the West. These, in addition to a second to none list of supporting players, make for one exceptionally performed ensemble. Outstanding creativity. Exquisite direction.\r\n\r\nIt was not my wish, as I composed this review, to go into detail (not even minorly) concerning the plot here, because, as I'd indicated earlier, many a generational has already witnessed this filmed phenomenon. And for me to have rehashed a summary of its plot would have been simply redundant.\r\n\r\nDirected by Academy Award-winner Victor Fleming (Gone with the Wind), The Wizard of Oz will always have the authority to command my love, my admiration, my awe, and my fascination. Always.\r\n\r\nFive out of five well-earned stars.",

  "content": "I was really fortunate, recently, to catch this on a big screen and it is still wonderful. After her dog is taken by \"Miss Gulch\" (Margaret Hamilton), \"Dorothy\" (Judy Garland) is all in a tizz. She decides to run away from her kindly aunt and uncle but only gets about a mile down the road before she encounters a medicine show run by \"Prof. Marvel\" (Frank Morgan). A twister is approaching - she must get home before she is blown away. She makes it into her room but is clouted by a blown-in window and next thing, the house is flying through the air and she lands in Oz and on top of the \"Witch of the East\" - exposing only her ruby slippers. \"Munchkinland\" proves to be a friendly enough place, but the good witch \"Glinda\" (Billie Burke) tells her that she must seek the help of the great and powerful Oz should she wish to get home. Now in possession of the dead witch's slippers, she sets off down the legendary \"Yellow Brick Road\" along which she encounters the scarecrow, the tin man and the frequently scene stealing cowardly lion (Bert Lahr) as they set off on their adventures - constantly harassed by the evil \"Witch of the West\" (Hamilton) who has designs on the shoes! The story evolves in the best traditions of a classic fairytale. Good vs. evil, humour, friendship, a good degree of pantomime menace, a can of WD40 and some small people with squeaky voices all contributing magnificently to the overall cinema experience. The colours of 'Oz\" are vivid and joyous - contrasting well with the drab, downbeat monochrome Kansas from whence \"Dorothy\" has come and to where she hopes to boldly go again! The cast is small and tightly knitted, allowing the relationships and momentum to build up stealthily from Frank Baum's original story to probably the finest denouement of any fantasy film made since. Miss Hamilton's characterisation (I always love a good baddie) reminded me of my English teacher at school - only this one wore less make up; and Bert Lahr and Jack Haley never fail to raise a smile - or even a tear - as they follow their own yellow brick roads. Yip Harburg and Harold Arlen have worked their magic with a score and songs that compliment the adventure splendidly - I wonder how many singers have had a go a \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\" since 1939? Despite being over eighty years old, it has lost little of it's magic. The visual effects rely on simplicity and vivacity, and they deliver well a thoroughly engaging story of longing, companionship and the most fiendish laugh in cinema history. Watch it, my pretty... or else!",

That doesn't mean that it isn't anything other than great though.\r\n\r\nI enjoy the bountiful humour and intriguing plot, while the newly-introduced toys are very good. If I had to nitpick, I don't massively like Lotso, who kinda feels to me like a slight copy of The Prospector from the 1999 sequel - with the difference here being he's the ultimate antagonist, perhaps too villainous for my own personal taste. As I said though, just a tiny criticism in the grand scheme of these productions.\r\n\r\nTom Hanks remains on top form as Woody, as do all the others including Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and Jessie (Joan Cusack). Ned Beatty does a terrific job as Lotso, while Barbie and Ken are brought to life well by Jodi Benson and Michael Keaton.\r\n\r\nOnce again there are some excellent scenes, with the ending also being entertaining just like in <em>'Toy Story 2'</em>. There's also a lot of heart in the concluding scene. I'm surprised they did a fourth time, even if I do agree it's still a very good new instalment.\r\n\r\nPixar and Disney keep up a pretty remarkable high quality, even in the third film of the franchise. I will never tire watching these.",

The plot develops pretty much as expected as \"Woody\" tries to organise a rescue from the outside whilst the imprisoned toys try to make their own way back home. Never before have I considered that \"Ken\" (yep, Mr \"Barbie\") could be remotely menacing, nor that a pink teddy bear called \"Lotso' could have a dominant streak a mile wide. Add to the mix, a recently reset \"Buzz\" who has forgotten just about everything and is now an enforcer, and this makes their break for freedom even harder. The script is quickly paced and witty, especially as the \"prison\" regime kicks in and the \"box\" becomes something akin to the \"cooler\" in a war film. This story deals a little more seriously with emotions of love and rejection but always in an humorous and engaging fashion - there is still plenty of fun and mischief to be had. I think this might be my favourite so far...",

Or why I am gifting it three stars?\r\n\r\nIt was a free rental at Redox.\r\nI normally enjoy Mark Wahlberg movies.\r\nI love Bumblebee.  \r\n\r\nDo any of these hold water?\r\n\r\nI know one thing that doesn’t hold a lot of water – the story. Does it really matter at this point in the franchise? There are good guy Transformers called Autobots and bad guy Transformers called Decepticons and standing between them are stupid humans that betray their species for profit – normally it’s the U.S. Government. BUT wait – there is one hero that will change all of this and talk Optimus Prime (Autobot Boss Daddy) into fighting one last battle (for the fourth or fifth time – I’ve lost count at this point) while some hot-looking woman runs around explosions in short-shorts.\r\n\r\nYou now know all you need to know about the entire _Transformer_ franchise.\r\n\r\nFor this incarnation we trade out Shia LeBeouf for Mark Wahlberg and Courtney Fox for Nicola Pelz. And now for the twist…wait for it… Mark Wahlberg plays Nicola Pelz’s FATHER.  That’s right – the FATHER. Yeah, it totally doesn’t work. At all.\r\n\r\nThere’s a point in the movie about 90 minutes in where it looks like all the loose ends are going to get tied up and I thought:  You know, that wasn’t so bad. Good action flick, a bit hoaky at points but watchable.\r\n\r\nAnd then the movie keeps going. And going. For another 90 minutes. And you basically watch the movie again except instead of it being in Texas and Chicago, it’s in China and Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nIt’s too long, too many explosions, too many American flags and Texas flags in the background. This movie desperately needs an editor or it needs to be euthanized. Probably the latter.\r\n\r\nJohn Goodman and Ken Watanabe lend their voices serve as decent comic relief but there’s not a lot that can save this film.  Bumblebee deserved better.",

  "content": "I guess even Michael Bay must have realised that by the fourth outing, this franchise needed refreshing. To that end, the previously long-suffering cast have been allowed to hang up their screwdrivers and a new set of characters have been drafted in. They are led by \"Cade\" (an enthusiastic Mark Wahlberg). Now he just happens to buy an old truck and it just happens to turn out to be the long lost \"Optimus Prime\". Of course, there are still agencies hunting for the robots and soon he and daughter \"Tessa\" (Nicola Peltz Beckham) are on the run from a militia controlled by the manipulative industrialist \"Joyce\" (Stanley Tucci). Quite why it needs to take 2¾ hours to get to the standard denouement is anyone's guess. Despite the inclusion of some Tyrannosaur-bots, the film has the same relentless predictability as the \"Autobots\" and \"Decepticons\" (if you can spot the difference) go through the same repetitively staged combat scenes before an ending that relies unduly on human intervention (oh yes, and lots of sentimentality too) before we essentially start back at square one with the usual \"Optimus\" monologue concluding the proceedings. This has the added benefit of a truly terrible performance from the always over-rated Kelsey Grammer who had a few, entirely futile, goes at being a cinema baddie and unlike the other films which had a semblance of internationalism to them, this is now an entirely American affair that just bored me. Surely no more...?",

  "content": "<em>'Transformers: Age of Extinction'</em>... what the hell happened here?! I actually seriously enjoyed a movie from this franchise, I'm honestly flabbergasted. It's written, directed and produced by the same people, though I wouldn't have predicted that whilst watching.\r\n\r\nThis, to me, felt almost entirely different to the preceding films in the series, despite the aforementioned. The opening 45-60 minutes are especially entertaining, it does wobble in that regard once or twice but when all is said and done I actually had a lot of fun with this!\r\n\r\nI was, for the first time, actually invested into not just the robots but also the human characters too. It's a new bunch on the latter side and, despite minimally liking Shia LaBeouf & friends, I found this lot to be a big upgrade - the change also made it feel fresh. Mark Wahlberg is great as lead, Stanley Tucci and T.J. Miller (for once) are pluses as well.\r\n\r\nNicola Peltz and Jack Reynor are the weakest members of those onscreen, though even then I was still marginally interested in them. Kelsey Grammer, despite playing a fairly standard antagonist, is good, as is Li Bingbing in a relatively smaller role. Peter Cullen, John Goodman and Ken Watanabe, meanwhile, impress with their voices.\r\n\r\nUpon starting this review, and still now, I was struggling to come up with negatives. I guess the near three-hour run time truly ought to be one, yet somehow it really... isn't, rather unexplainably. As for a criticism, the excessive product placement is all I've got, I'm afraid.\r\n\r\nI'm yet to see the reception that this got, as usual I'm hoping my thoughts are not an outlier in a sea of dissatisfaction. I'd guess it's rated as mid-ly as the prior installments, at worst. Not that any of this is all that important of course, because I enjoyed it and that's all that matters. I did not expect to be saying that, at all!\r\n\r\n*checks reception*: Welp. An outlier I seemingly am. Then again, 12k (on Letterboxd) others agree with my rating (and it incredibly again made a billion on the big screen, I see) so I guess it isn't as bad as it looks. Some uncertainty has crept into my mind, I'm thinking it over and comparing it with other films I've rated similarly and... it's not even in doubt. Wild.",

We can't avoid them, because when we look for a particular type of film for the occasion, they will pop-up and that is how I watched this now. I know it is a silly comedy, because in a real world this thing never happen. So knowing this is only for cinema, I prepared to enjoy whatever it offers. But I must say, even though my rating is not big, I kind of enjoyed it.\r\n\r\nNobody watches this without knowing its synopsis. So you will already know the fifty per cent of the story when you do. The rest is how it is developed; including how good the jokes are that comes with our watch. So much cliché, but entertaining with some good scenes and lines. The actors were excellent. The make-ups were not flawless, but worked okay, especially for a comedy. Because if there is an error, it will going to appeals from the comedic side.\r\n\r\nSo the overall film was better than what I presumed all these years. Glad I saw it, it's nothing like those silly comedies I've seen. I've seen many imposter themes, but this is refreshing. All the above, this is a one off film, that's the best thing about it. You know, sequels are what degrades the original film in most of the scenarios. Thanks for that, there's no follow-up for this with a B movie cast and crew. This is a very much watchable film, not comedy riot, but fairly does its job.\r\n\r\n_6/10_",

Despite concerns about blackface and whiteface, the movie managed to navigate this sensitive territory at a time when such issues were not as heavily scrutinized, allowing it to avoid significant backlash.\r\n\r\nThe film's creative humor and unique concept contributed to its enduring popularity, with audiences still enjoying and quoting it years after its release. While the portrayal of black men disguised as white women may seem unrealistic due to the obvious nature of their disguises, the movie's over-the-top and comedic approach adds to its charm and entertainment value.\r\n\r\nUltimately, \"White Chicks\" is a lighthearted and cheesy comedy that aims to entertain rather than offend. Viewers are encouraged to approach the film with a sense of fun and appreciation for its playful and exaggerated take on gender and racial dynamics. By embracing the movie's humor and acknowledging its intentions, audiences can enjoy a comedic ride that offers a break from the seriousness of everyday life.",

Thing is, he'd much rather just stay at home and leave the governing to someone else. \"I know\", thinks he - let's go and find the legendary \"Prince Artie\" and see if we can't get him to take the job instead. Off he, \"Donkey\" and \"Puss in Boots\" set on their quest, but they don't bargain on the scheming \"Prince Charming\" who has designs on the throne for himself. It's this latter gent who has cleverly assembled an army straight from the Brothers Grimm to do his fighting, charming and seducing for him. Can our intrepid trio manage to thwart his cunning plan, find the missing prince and get back before \"Fiona\" has her baby? I actually quite enjoyed this rather derivative adventure, possibly because the annoying donkey takes much lesser a role as their search plays to many other fantasies, a bit of Arthurian myth and has plenty of action to keep it moving along for ninety minutes. It was always going to be more difficult to keep the character fresh after six years, and the writing here isn't quite as witty as we've seen before, but the underlying characters are still quite engaging and the hero/anti-hero storyline did rise a smile from time to time. Maybe Dreamworks ought to take the hint, though, and call it quits now?",

Spade is terrific as Kuzco, bringing the perfect wit to the self-serving emperor. Goodman is the overall star though, I thoroughly enjoyed him in the role of Pacha. Patrick Warburton is also decent as Kronk.\r\n\r\nIt all makes for chilled out viewing, you'll have a good time if you just sit back and enjoy it - as I did.",

  "content": "Deceptive though it might seem, high camp can be a tricky artform to pull off successfully on screen, especially in genres like horror and sci-fi. It requires deftly managed, evenly sustained pacing – not necessarily at the breakneck speed of a screwball comedy, but certainly steady in its regular dispensing of delicious nuggets of wry and macabre wit with bridge segments in between them that move the story along without overstaying their welcome. Sadly, however, in his fourth feature outing, director Dan Allen only gets this down pat about half of the time in this twisted and sinister retelling of the classic Felix Salten 1923 novel about a motherless roe coping with life in the forest. In this ghoulish iteration of the tale, a divorced mother (Roxanne McKee) and her 13-year-old son (Tom Mulheron) are on their way to visit her in-laws’ family after her ex-husband (Adrian Relph) summarily ditches his promise to spend the weekend with the boy. However, the duo’s journey is interrupted when their ride is brazenly attacked on a remote roadway by a ferocious mutant adult stag that looks like something out of the “Jurassic Park/Jurassic World” movies only with cheesier special effects (but with a supremely stylish set of hooves that resemble those in the inner sleeve artwork from the Rolling Stones’ Tattoo You LP (1981)). Not only does the woodland monster go after the stunned mother and son, but also all of their relatives, including the family matriarch (Nicola Wright), who suffers from a form of dementia but seems to have an unusual (but unexplained) psychic bond to Bambi. This scenario is further complicated by a band of apparent bounty hunters who are charged with capturing and/or killing the creature, as well as other equally gruesome wild animals that have also mysteriously mutated, including a pack of rabbits whose carnivorous proclivities put the bunny from “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” (1975) to shame. The reasons behind the hunt don’t become clear until well into the film (after more than enough of the aforementioned protracted narrative hammocks), but they nonetheless provide the absent justification behind much of the story (as well as the source of Bambi’s unrepentant rage), making for a final act that compensates for many of the picture’s prior shortcomings. To its credit, the film’s campy elements are well done, but there just aren’t enough of them and they’re a little too loosely strung together (at least initially), almost feeling as if the in-between sequences amount to little more than excessive padding to fill out the runtime. In addition, there’s a certain predictability to the narrative wherein it’s easy to guess who’s going to get done in and when, as well as who ultimately ends up surviving the ordeal. I was also somewhat puzzled by the preponderance of F-bombs scattered throughout the screenplay, a count that rivals “The Wolf of Wall Street” (2013) at times, particularly for a story involving younger characters. These issues are somewhat made up for by the inclusion of several surprisingly touching moments, an unexpectedly nice counterpart to the graphic (but generally in-context) gratuitousness that pervades the film, often depicted in colorful and cleverly raucous ways (remember what I said about those bunnies). Indeed, those who enjoy their horror with a touch of dark humor are sure to enjoy this production from the makers of the “Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey” films, though don’t be disappointed if you still come away from it hungering for a little more, especially in light of this offering’s scant 1:21:00 duration. Nevertheless, come the movie’s end, don’t be surprised if you still find yourself heaving a heavy sigh and heartily exclaiming “Deer me!”",
